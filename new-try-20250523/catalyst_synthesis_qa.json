The catalyst made by the DP method has an average Au NP size of 6.2 nm, consistent with the\ncoordination number of Au-Au as 9.4 from EXAFS fittings reported for this type of catalyst21.\n\nexperimental evidence, which determined Au to be cationic; namely, AuIII for the as-prepared catalyst\n\nand AuI for the used catalyst. Therefore, we conclude that none of these models accurately represent the nature of the\nactive site.\nAs done in our previous work1, we enriched the above Au-centric clusters with more electron-withdrawing –O groups\neither by directly adding O atoms or by removing H atoms, thus raising the Bader charge on Au in the process. We\nstopped adding O-groups when the Bader charge on Au became close to that of AuI (+0.41 e). This criterion provides\na lower limit on the number of O atoms added or H atoms removed from the clusters. Importantly, the new clusters\nmust favor the formation of formaldehyde, as opposed to dioxy-methylene species to avoid forming additional formate\nspecies, and thus reducing the Bader charge on Au below that of AuI. This latter criterion provided an upper bound on\nthe number of –O groups on the evolved cluster models. If there were too many –O groups, the Bader Au charge\nwould be too high to sustain a formaldehyde species, which would rather prefer to bond to an O/OH group instead of\nthe Au center, thus forming the dioxy-methylene species. This was the case for the modifications (+O-H) and (+O-\n2H) of Au -O -Na -(OH) (see Supplementary , (+O), (+2O), (+O-H), (+2O-H), and (+O-2H) of Au -O -Na -\n1 2 9 9 1 3 9\n(OH) (see Supplementary , (+O), (+2O), (+O-H), (+O-2H), and (+2O-2H) of Au -O -Na -(OH) (see\n7 1 6 9 2\nSupplementary , and (+2O), (+2O-H), (+2O-2H), (+3O-2H), and (+4O) of Au -O -Na -(OH) (see\n1 7 9 2\nSupplementary . Only three modifications satisfied both criteria mentioned above: (+O) of Au -O -Na -(OH)\n1 2 9 9\nthus yielding Au -O -Na -(OH) (see Supplementary , (+2O-2H) of Au -O -Na -(OH) thus yielding Au -O -\n1 3 9 9 1 3 9 7 1 7\nNa -(OH) (see Supplementary , (+2O-H) of Au -O -Na -(OH) thus yielding Au -O -Na -(OH) (see\n9 5 1 6 9 2 1 9 9 1\nSupplementary . All these structures were optimized to arrive at their minimum-energy configurations.\nSubsequently, the Au Bader charge was calculated to verify that the afore-mentioned modifications – in their most-\nstable structures – pass our selection criteria. This screening process was performed using static DFT calculations for\ncomputational efficiency, while the computationally demanding AIMD were reserved to studying the methanol self-\ncoupling reaction on the three selected clusters. Importantly, the identity (i.e. stoichiometry) of the resultant clusters\nfrom the above screening process will not have been different had AIMD been used during the screening process.\nSpecifically, the rejected modifications above had conclusively violated our selection criteria (their Au Bader charges\nwere considerably less than +0.41 e, and their preference to dioxy methylene species was decisive, as shown in\nSupplementary -38), and this violation will not have been flipped had AIMD been performed during the\nselection process. As for the selected clusters, they were re-optimized using AIMD, and then used for investigating\nthe methanol self-coupling reaction using AIMD calculations, as explained in the following section.\nAIMD simulations: methanol coupling on the evolved cluster models\n\nexperimentally-determined apparent activation energy of ~95 kJ/mol.\n\nFinally, we kept track of the calculated Bader charge on Au at each structure, starting from the undecorated cluster,\nfollowed by its decoration by permanent HCOO spectators, and by the different stages of the catalytic cycle ,\nSupplementary -41). The undecorated clusters possess a high Au Bader charge close to AuIII of (+1.11 e). The\ndecorated active sites have their Au Bader charge close to the AuI charge of (+0.41 e), as expected by their design (see\nprevious section). This also could come as a direct result of the opening of the Au environment which becomes less\ncoordinated with O, and thus, prone to binding formaldehyde, compared to the bare undecorated cluster where Au\nwas coordinated with multiple O atoms. The decrease in Au-O coordination is captured by our EXAFS results as\ndiscussed above (see Supplementary . The Au charge varies during the catalytic cycle, turning anionic after\nthe coupling steps, but not before. This indicates that cationic Au is responsible for the coupling reaction/step. Cationic\nAu is regenerated after desorption of products. While our alternative pathways do not deliver the clusters back to the\nAuI charge, we note that AuI was not the exclusive product of the XPS analysis (Supplementary .\n\nexperimentally through EXAFS and the X-Ray pair distribution function (PDF, see Supplementary .\nSpecifically, we seek to reproduce distances in the region of up to 4 Å (where ordering is observed in experimental\nmeasurements), through the RDFs of our individual cluster models.\nThe three clusters contain different Au coordination; their local Au coordinations are shown in Supplementary A. To calculate the RDFs for the clusters at a reasonable computational cost, we performed AIMD in smaller unit\ncells (with dimensions of 15 Å x 15.5 Å x 15.2 Å) than our reactivity calculations. In our simulations the timestep was\n\nset to 1 fs, the sampling temperature was 300 K and was controlled by the Anderson thermostat (which performs better\nthan Nosé-Hoover in modeling structural characteristics of 3D materials; e.g. zeolites49, 50). After equilibration of 2\nps, for each cluster, 10 trajectories of at least 1.5 ps each were modeled, leading to a total sampling time of more than\n15 ps. Subsequently the nearest neighbor distances of the Au atom were extracted from the MD runs and the\n\nexperimentally determined values. At the same time, the\nexperimentally measured coordination number (CN) of 3 implies that a superposition of linear (CN=2) and square\nplanar structure (CN=4) might exist, which cannot be excluded based on the modeled RDF alone.\nSubsequently, we analyze the second coordination shell between Au and Na and find peaks at 2.86 Å and 3.10 Å for\nAu -O -Na -(OH) and Au -O -Na -(OH) , respectively. Both values significantly underestimate the experimentally\n1 9 9 1 1 7 9 5\ndetermined values of 3.30 Å/3.36 Å observed in EXAFS and PDF. The Au -O -Na -(OH) cluster, on the other hand,\n1 3 9 9\nshows a maximum at 3.40 Å, in good agreement with the experimentally measured distances and even the\nexperimentally observed shoulder at 3.63 Å/3.67 Å is well reproduced.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41557-019-0345-3\nSource: supplementary PDF\n\nMaterials and Methods\nSupplementary Text\nSupplementary to 50\nSupplementary to 3\nReferences 01-52\n\nContents\n\nCatalysts Preparation ................................................................................................................................................. 3\nCatalysts Characterization (BET, XRD, XPS, AC-HAADF-STEM, ICP, SEM, XAS, XPS, PDF, and DRIFTS) ... 4\nActivity Tests ............................................................................................................................................................. 5\nDensity functional theory (DFT) ............................................................................................................................... 6\nSupplementary Text ....................................................................................................................................................... 7\nPDF, XRD, XPS and XANES/EXAFS investigations .............................................................................................. 7\nAberration-corrected(AC)-HAADF-STEM ............................................................................................................... 9\nActivity Tests: Water-gas shift reaction .................................................................................................................. 10\nActivity Tests: Methanol conversion reactions ........................................................................................................ 11\nIn situ DRIFTS—Methanol self-coupling reaction ................................................................................................. 12\nDFT and AIMD calculations – Model evolution towards identifying the nature of the active site under reaction\nconditions and reaction mechanism for MF formation ............................................................................................ 14\nAIMD simulations: methanol coupling on the evolved cluster models ................................................................... 15\nHybrid functional corrections for energy and Au charge of the PW91-optimized geometries ................................ 18\nCalculated radial distribution functions and comparison to EXAFS and X-Ray Pair-Distribution Function. ......... 18\nCalculation of XPS shifts for Au -O -Na -(OH) .................................................................................................... 19\n1 3 9 9\nData: figures and tables ........................................................................................................................................... 20\nReferences: .............................................................................................................................................................. 63\n\nCatalysts Preparation\nIn this work, titanium dioxide in anatase form from Millennium (G5, 100 % anatase, ~270 m2/g) was used as the\nsupport for various gold/titania catalysts. γ-Al O was purchased from Inframat Advanced Materials with ~150 m2/g\n2 3\nsurface area.

He), flow rate 207 ml/min. 100-200 mg sample was used to vary the contact time such\n2 2 2\nthat the conversion remained <15 %). Testing began at the highest temperature and lasted for 4 h before cooling down\nto other temperatures to avoid deactivation during the kinetic measurements. The feed and product gas streams were\nanalyzed by an HP-6890 GC equipped with a TCD detector. The kinetics measurement error was <10 %. The product-\nfree WGS experiments were run in a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument equipped with a mass spectrometer.\nThe catalysts were stabilized in a 10 % CO- 3 % H O- He gas mixture for 30 min at 50 oC before being heated at 5\n\noC/min (100 mg sample, 30 mL/min). CO-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) tests were run in the same\nMicromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. For each experiment, the sample was purged in He at 100 °C to remove\nany physically adsorbed CO and H O. The sample was stabilized in 10 % CO-He for 20 min at 50 oC, then heated up\n2 2\nto 300 oC (5 oC/min). The regeneration of the surface –OH species is by rehydrating the catalysts with 3 % H O-He\n\nfor 1h when ramping down to RT between consecutive cycles. The samples did not contact air at any temperature\nduring the cyclic tests.\nThe temperature-programmed and steady-state steam reforming of methanol (SRM) tests were carried out in a fixed-\nbed quartz microreactor (6mm OD, 4mm ID) at atmospheric pressure. A gaseous mixture of 2 % CH OH, 2.6 % H O\n3 2\nbalanced in He was passed through the fixed-bed of 100 mg catalyst and 400 mg of inert quartz sand. The quartz sand\nwas calcined in air at 800°C for 2 h prior to use. The total flow rate of the SRM-steady state reaction was set at 20\nmL/min. Reaction temperature was first increased to 300 °C at 5 °C/min, and was decreased down to 220 °C step by\nstep with isothermal holding at each set temperature for 75 min to fully approach the steady state. The methanol\nconversion was limited to below 15-20 % in order to obtain the reaction rates in the kinetics control region. The total\n\nflow rate of the temperature-programmed SRM was set at 10 mL/min. Reaction temperature was increased from 30\nto 300 °C at 2 °C/min. The feed and the product gases were analyzed online by a residual gas analyzer (RGA, MKS\nmodel RS-1). The RGA was calibrated by monitoring a series of gases or vaporized liquids carried by ultra-high purity\nHe at different concentrations. The calibrated compounds for SRM include: CH OH (m/z=31), H O (m/z=18), CO\n3 2\n(m/z=28), CO (m/z=44), H (m/z=2). The CO signal (m/z=28) was corrected for the contribution of CH OH and CO\n2 2 3 2\nat m/z=28. The outlet gas was analyzed by mass spectrometry and checked for H , CO, CO , He, H O, formaldehyde\n2 2 2\n(HCHO), formic acid (HCOOH), dimethyl ether (CH OCH ), and methyl formate (HC(=O)OCH ).\n3 3 3\nThe dynamic temperature-programmed and the steady-state activity tests of the non-oxidative methanol\ndehydrogenation were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz microreactor (6 mm OD, 4 mm ID) at atmospheric pressure.\n10 vol.% CH OH balanced with He was used as reactant gas with 20 mL/min flow rate to pass through catalyst bed,\n\nwhich consisted of 200 mg catalyst and 400 mg quartz, with 5 °C/min ramping rate. For the kinetic study, conversion\nof methanol was controlled in the range of 10 -18 %. Since methyl formate has fragments of m/z=32, 31, 29 and 28,\nsame as the cracking pattern of methanol in mass spectrometry, m/z=60 was used as the distinct signal of methyl\nformate.\nDensity functional theory (DFT)\nDFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)4, 5, and employing the\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA-PW91)6 to describe the exchange-correlation functional, and the projector\naugmented wave potentials (PAW)7, 8 to describe electron-ion interactions, in the framework of ab initio molecular\ndynamics (AIMD)9. The wave function was expanded in a plane-waves basis set, truncated at a kinetic energy cutoff\nof 400 eV. All cluster models were enclosed in a 20×20×20 Å3 cubic cell, and calculations were performed with the\nBrillouin Zone sampled at the gamma point. The method described in was implemented to calculate Bader\ncharges. All calculations were spin-polarized. Vibrational frequencies of translational, rotational, and vibrational\nmodes were estimated assuming a harmonic oscillator, and using second-order numerical differentiation of forces\nusing a step size of 0.015 Å. We use these methods to study the thermochemistry (based on total energies) of the\nmethanol dehydrogenation reaction. Owing to the complexity of the structures of our single-atom clusters, we do not\ncalculate the free energies of the elementary steps, given that this would require the calculation of the vibrational\nmodes for all atoms in these clusters. Additionally, given the large number of adsorption sites available, and the\nflexibility of the structures involved, we do not attempt to identify minimum energy paths defining the transition states\nfor such dehydrogenation steps. Doing this would be prohibitively expensive, and yet, inconclusive as to whether the\nminimum energy path is truly identified.\n\nSupplementary Text\nPDF, XRD, XPS and XANES/EXAFS investigations\nXPS experiments were conducted to identify the chemical state of the gold and sodium elements in the dried powder.\nAs shown in Supplementary , the gold species were mainly AuIII. Supplementary shows the XPS binding\nenergy in the Na1s region. The narrow featuring peak at ~1072.0 eV indicates that the sodium ions were distributed\nin the gold compound with a specific chemical composition. The value of this binding energy further corroborated\nthat the sodium is stabilized through –O-Na linkages in this material, in agreement with our previous reports to create\nthe Pt -O -Na and Au -O -Na linkages by more complex preparation methods1, 11, 12. The XPS of O1s in Au -O -Na -\n1 x 1 x 1 x 9\n(OH) can be deconvoluted into three different O species (Supplementary , the peak centered at around 531 eV\n\ny\nassigned as the O in OH bonded with metal atom13, the peak at 532.6 eV as O in NaOH14, and the peak at 530.2 eV as\nO in Au-O15.\nXRD analysis, Supplementary , clearly shows that the dried complex is not a physical mixture of NaOH and\nAu(OH) . Rather, it is a new inorganic compound with 14.3 and 17.2 -degree peaks (corresponding to 6.15 and 5.12\n\nÅ d-spacing, respectively). The significant diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of the gold-sodium powder indicate\na highly crystalline structure. Thus, phase(s) different from NaOH and Au(OH) were formed in this compound. A\n\nthorough peak-search-match was performed on the XRD pattern of the Au -O -Na -(OH) with the standard patterns\n1 x 9 y\nof species that contain Na, O, H, C, Au and Si in the data base. But none of these standard patterns matched the\ndiffraction pattern of Au -O -Na -(OH) powder. In order to check these results with another alkali metal, we also\n1 x 9 y\nsynthesized Au -O -K-(OH) from Au(OH) and KOH by the same protocol. Au -O -K -(OH) displays very similar\n1 x z y 3 1 x 9 y\ndiffraction pattern as that of Au -O -Na -(OH) . The characteristic peaks at 14.3 and 17.2 degrees do not match any\n1 x 9 y\nof the reported patterns in the database. These peaks correspond to d-spacing of 6.15 and 5.12 Å, respectively. This is\nin agreement with the reported unit cell sizes of Na Au(S O ) ·2H O and [Au(1,2,4-L)(PPh )] that are between 5 and\n3 2 3 2 2 3\n18 Å16, 17. No significant peak shift was observed in Au -O -K -(OH) compared to Au -O -Na -(OH) as the d-spacing\n1 x 9 y 1 x 9 y\nis much bigger than the difference between the size of Na+ and K+. There is no observable structural change of the\nTiO (Supplementary and Al O (Supplementary after Au -O -Na -(OH) were deposited, indicating\n2 2 3 1 x 9 y\nthere is no destructive effect of Au -O -Na -(OH) solution. XPS analysis of the titania-supported gold catalysts finds\n1 x 9 y\nno observable change of chemical valence of Ti (Supplementary .\nThe gold-oxo-sodium complex in solution and in its dried powder form was analyzed by X-ray absorption near edge\nstructure (XANES) and by EXAFS. As illustrated by the Au L edge white lines in , the gold species clearly\nIII\nhas a cationic nature. While the R-space profiles for the gold-sodium solution were too noisy to be analyzed due to\nlow concentration, we were able to conduct EXAFS analysis for the dried gold-sodium powder. Zero contributions\nfrom Au-Au coordination were found in this solid, while the gold is coordinated with the surrounding oxygen atoms\nas N = 3.0. It is noteworthy that even in “oxidized gold” crystal models such as Au O and NaAuO , due to the\nAu-O 2 3 2\npresence of long-distance organized unit cells, the contribution of Au-Au coordination can range from 1 to 2.\nTherefore, combining the PDF, XRD, XPS, and XAS data, we conclude that the new gold complexes are composed\nof a single gold cation stabilized by the –O-Na linkages, with abundant vicinal –OH species.\n\nUnsupported Au -O -Na -(OH) and Au -O -K -(OH) are investigated by PDF. The peak at 1.994/1.998Å\n1 x 9 y 1 x 6 y\ncorresponds to the Au-O bond length. Two peaks at 3.3 and 3.6 Å, which are also observed in the EXAFS analysis,\nmay be attributed to Au-Au or Au-Na/K distances. The features at ~2.97 Å and 4.04 Å that are not observed in the\nAu-edge EXAFS data can be attributed to non-Au containing Na/K-Na/K and Na/K-O distances. The larger difference\nin the intensity of these features between the Na and K analogues, supports this assignment.\nPeak positions and areas in the PDFs of unsupported Au -O -Na -(OH) and Au -O -K -(OH)\n1 x 9 y 1 x 6 y\nNa K\nCenter (Å) Area (a.u.)

Liquid N was used and proved effective to mitigate Au reduction by the high-energy beam\n\n(Supplementary for the as-prepared Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO sample. X-ray induced oxygen vacancy\n1 x 9 y 2\nformation of TiO is well-known18, which leads to reduction of cationic Au19 that can be mitigated by cooling to 113\n\nK. The chemical valence and bonding structure of the gold loaded on titania by the IWI and the standard DP methods\nare also indicated by the shape of the spectra in \nthe unsupported gold-sodium powder or solution, which is construed as clear evidence that the cluster structure of the\nsingle-atom gold stabilized by sodium ions through –O- linkages is not modified on the titania support. There is\nnegligible contribution of Au-Ti coordination for both 0.5 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO and 1.0 wt.% Au -O -Na -\n1 x 9 y 2 1 x 9\n(OH) /TiO as expected when gold species are highly dispersed on the titania support. The cationic gold in the gold\ny 2\ncomplexes is stabilized by the surrounding –O, and has a low total coordination number, which is a strong indication\nthat these gold sites can be catalytically active. In contrast, the 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO (DP) comprises metallic gold\n\naccording to the XANES spectra, and the 1st shell EXAFS fitting results confirm the presence of metallic Au\nnanoparticles (NPs) having exclusively Au-Au bonding (N =9.4).\nAu-Au\nAt Au:Na=1:9, a crystalline compound is retrieved on drying, see XRD data, Supplementary \nprecipitate collected when the ratio of Na and Au was 3:1 in Supplementary \nmethanol self-coupling reaction, the latter shown in Supplementary \ncatalyst for the methanol self-coupling reaction at 170 °C.\nCO-TPR and XPS were employed to determine the x and y values. CO-TPR was performed over the as-prepared\nAu -O -Na -(OH) to titrate the active OH groups (CO + OH → CO + ½ H ) by integrating the CO TPR curve\n1 x 9 y 2 2\n(Supplementary . The calculated amount of the surface OH groups (sampled by CO to 200 oC) is around\n9.3 times that of Au, which is very close to the ratio of Au and OH in the proposed structure. The rate reaches\nmaximum value above a Na:Au atomic ratio of 9:1, Supplementary \ny 2 1 x 9 9 2\n and e, a set of AC-HAADF-STEM images at different areas and scales are shown in Supplementary -7.\nThe contrast of the atomic species in AC-HAADF-STEM is approximately proportional to the square of the atomic\nnumbers for various elements, and the sodium atoms are indeed too “light” relative to the average atomic numbers of\nthe various supports to be shown in these materials. For each of the 1.0 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO samples, over\n1 x 9 y 2\na hundred of AC-HAADF-STEM images were taken; no gold NPs were observed in these samples. Supplementary\n and 7 show the AC-HAADF-STEM images of typical areas of the 0.5 wt. % and 1.0 wt. % Au -O -Na -\n1 x 9\n(OH) /TiO catalysts. The pseudo sub-nm clusters identified in the images with square contours appear to be a few\ny 2\nisolated gold atoms sitting close to each other. When AC-HAADF-STEM images were recorded with lower\nmagnifications or slight defocus on these gold species due to the different heights of titania planes, these gold species\ntend to look similar to any true gold clusters, but the pseudo sub-nm clusters are composed of isolated (non-contiguous)\natoms. In addition, according to the EXAFS analysis, the Au-Au coordination number was zero. This means that these\nslightly larger gold species captured in the 1.0 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO are still atomically dispersed gold\n1 x 9 y 2\nspecies; they are just in close proximity, but are not connected, hence we use the term “pseudo sub-nm clusters” to\ndescribe them. We and other groups have reported similar observations for single-atom platinum species, where a few\nseemingly platinum sub-nm clusters are actually composed of single atoms being located close to each other without\ndirect metal-metal bonding12, 20.\nDifferent from the sodium ion-stabilized gold catalysts prepared by the IWI method, the 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO (DP) sample\n\nhas abundant Au NPs, as is well established for this type preparation of gold on titania12. A set of typical AC-HAADF-\nSTEM micrographs for the 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO (DP) sample is shown in Supplementary \n\nto each other. The catalyst made by the DP method has an average Au NP size of 6.2 nm, consistent with the\ncoordination number of Au-Au as 9.4 from EXAFS fittings reported for this type of catalyst21.\nActivity Tests: Water-gas shift reaction\nIn the WGS and the other reactions examined in this work, no degassing or activation of the catalyst was necessary\nprior to reaction. Owing to the high amount of the atomically-dispersed gold in the 1.0 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO\n1 x 9 y 2\nsample, this catalyst shows high overall activity for low-temperature WGS reaction (Supplementary . We\ntitrated the number of such –OH groups by CO-TPR, and found that the amount of regenerable –OH species in the\n0.5 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO catalyst is actually twice that of the 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO (DP) catalyst containing\n1 x 9 y 2 2\nalmost 10 times more gold. The abundance of these -OH groups also translates into proportionally higher overall\nreaction rates (Supplementary . The 3rd consecutive cycle CO-TPR profiles for sodium ion-stabilized\ngold/titania catalysts are shown in Supplementary \nstoichiometric reduction of –OH by CO molecules to produce CO and H simultaneously. The light-off temperature\n2 2\nfor H matches well with the reaction onset around 60 oC in product-free conditions (10 % CO - 3 % H O- He, 30\n2 2\nml/min, 100 mg sample, 5 oC/min) as shown in Supplementary and Supplementary \nimproved WGS catalytic activity. As long as the gold species are atomically dispersed, when the amount of single-\ngold atoms was doubled (from 0.5 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO to 1.0 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO ), the amount\n1 x 9 y 2 1 x 9 y 2\nof regenerable –OH and the low-temperature WGS reaction rate were also doubled (Supplementary -11). In\nagreement with our previous findings1, the –OH vicinal to the atomic gold centers initiate the low-temperature WGS\nreaction. Single Au atom catalysts synthesized by different methods from various precursors share very close turnover\nfrequency (TOF) as shown in Supplementary , which indicates that [Au -O ] species is the intrinsic active site\n1 x\nfor WGS. If the active species is formed, the supports do not have a direct role for WGS, which is corroborated by\nWGS temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) on unsupported Au -O -Na -(OH) (Supplementary .\n1 x 9 y\nThe activity of the supported sodium ion-stabilized gold oxo-cluster WGS catalysts is stable up to 200 oC during two\ncycles of 10 h-each test with shutdown of the reaction in 3 % water vapor to RT (Supplementary . The catalyst\nis also stable under strong reducing atmosphere in the presence of CO and water vapor (see XPS analysis of as-\n\nprepared and used catalysts, and EXAFS of as-prepared catalysts, Supplementary Figs. 16 and17 and Supplementary\n.\nThe chemical state of the gold in the catalysts was investigated before and after the WGS reaction (10 % CO - 3 %\nH O- He, 200 oC, 1 h at steady state, 100 mg sample). Using XPS, the gold is mainly AuIII in the fresh catalysts\n\n(Supplementary , which agrees with the XANES findings for both the supported and unsupported dried gold-\nsodium powder . The sodium-ion-stabilized catalysts are catalytically stable under the WGS reaction\n\ncondition; the working catalyst is AuI (Supplementary . A slight contribution from metallic Au0 is seen,\noriginating from a few agglomerated Au NPs (Supplementary . On the other hand, Au NPs dominate on the\nmuch less active 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO (DP) sample, with metallic gold found in both the fresh and used catalysts\n\n(Supplementary .\nXPS Na1s spectra were collected to identify the chemical state of the sodium in the Au-O -Na (OH) catalysts. In the\nx 9- y\ncatalysts studied in this work, NaOH reacts with Au(OH) to create the –O-Na stabilized single-atom gold oxo-\n\nclusters; that is, a direct interaction between the gold and sodium ions via -O- has been established. Similar to the\nsodium-ion-stabilized platinum catalysts22, 23, the sodium element has a clear featuring peak at 1071.9 eV\n(Supplementary , which is a typical region (1071.5-1072.5 eV) for the direct Na-O- bond 24,25. This means that\nthe -O- linkages that stabilize the gold atoms in the new catalysts are shared with -O-Na bonds. Therefore, mutual\nstabilization between the gold and sodium is established through the -O- linkages between the two elements. The small\nshoulder peak around 1067.0 eV is attributed to TiIV (TiO ) Auger peak24. The chemical environment of the sodium\n\nis stable during the WGS reaction up to 200 oC (~ 3 % CO generated in the gas stream). As shown in Supplementary\n\n, the Na1s peak shape change in the Au -O -Na -(OH) samples is minimal after the WGS reaction. Possible\n1 x 9 y\nemerging compositions that can be generated under CO rich stream, such as Na CO and NaHCO 26, in the 1071-\n2 2 3 3\n1071.5 eV range, were not observed indicating the mutual stabilization of the gold and sodium ions through the –O-\nbonds.\nActivity Tests: Methanol conversion reactions\nTo investigate the role of water in methanol conversion reactions, (CH OH + H O)-TPSR was conducted on the three\n3 2\nrepresentative catalyst samples (Supplementary .

No CO production was detected up to 300 °C, leaving a wide temperature window for both gold-\ncontaining samples to conduct CO-free methanol steam reforming. The generation of CO is proportional to the\n\nformation of H and the consumption of methanol, but a lag is observed, typical in this type of experiments. The set"

Graphene quantum dots, later interweaved into a carbon matrix, were used as a support, providing numerous anchoring sites and thus facilitating the generation of high densities of transition-metal atoms with sufficient spacing between the metal atoms to avoid aggregation. A significant increase in activity in electrochemical CO\n\nreduction (used as a representative reaction) was demonstrated on a Ni single-atom catalyst with increased Ni loading.\n\nSynthesis of functionalized GQDs\nA modified molecular fusion route was employed to synthesize well-crystallized GQDs–NH\n\n(\n\npreparation of GQDs\n\n. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and X-ray diffraction suggest that the GQDs are well crystallized, with a uniform size of ~6–8 nm \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nSynthesis of Ir single-atom catalyst\nWe then use the as-obtained GQDs–NH\n\nsolution to synthesize the Ir–N–C catalyst with varied iridium loadings \n). Specifically, different volumes of IrCl\n\nstock solution (5 milligrams per millilitre) were first added into 30 millilitres of GQDs–NH\n\nsolution (1 milligram per millilitre), henceforth referred to as Ir–N–C-\n\nsynthesis transition of the GQDs–NH\n\n/Ir\n3+\nmixture to the single-atom Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, we first examined the sample using ex-situ X-ray diffraction under different temperatures, which represent different synthesis phases. As shown in Supplementary \n, the GQDs started to get fused at 300 °C to form an amorphous bulk carbon, indicated by the emerging of a broad peak at around 19° as well as the decreasing of the intensity of the GQD peak. The amorphization transition might be due to the heavy incorporation of nitrogen and iridium atoms into the GQD lattice under high temperature. With the temperature further increased, the peak of the GQDs completely disappeared, and two broad peaks at approximately 19° and 38° (Supplementary \n) emerged, suggesting the full formation of amorphous bulk carbon from GQD assembly after pyrolysis. No metallic iridium peaks were observed in Ir–N–C-7 catalysts. Ex-situ XPS study (Supplementary \n) reveals that the oxidation state of Ir gradually increases from 300 °C to 500 °C, which also implies that the Ir\n3+\nstabilized by the amine functional group in the GQDs–NH\n\n/Ir\n3+\nmixture gradually coordinated with the lattice nitrogen and carbon to form more stable Ir–N\n\nsynthesis of high-loading Ir–N–C-7 catalyst. Initially, the Ir\n3+\natoms were stably absorbed on the GQDs–NH\n\nsurface by the strong chelation/complexation effect between metal cations and amine groups. With the temperature continuing to increase, the small GQDs started to interconnect and then to form a three-dimensional bulk carbon that can be directly used for practical applications. Simultaneously, the surface nitrogen will be in-situ doped into the GQD lattice under high temperature, and thus help to trap the isolated Ir atoms to form the Ir–N\n\nsynthesis. However, we found that even if the loading of Ir is less than 10 wt%, nanoparticles will be formed (Supplementary \n), showing obvious metallic Ir X-ray diffraction peaks. This observation reveals that a high-loading Ir single-atom catalyst could not be obtained using the carbon support with only a high level of nitrogen dopant, demonstrating the unique role of the GQDs. While GO–NH\n\nis as stable as GQDs during pyrolysis, it shows a very low surface-to-volume ratio, providing limited anchor sites. As the intermediate carbon support, GQDs are unique since they can supply numerous surface anchoring sites for large loadings of isolated metal atoms, and they are stable enough during pyrolysis to prevent the isolated atom aggregation.\n\nSynthesis of other single-atom catalysts\nTo validate if our GQD-assisted synthesis method can be extended to synthesize other TM single-atom catalysts with high metal loadings, we first replaced the iridium precursor with platinum to prepare Pt–N–C single-atom catalysts.\n\nsynthesis method. As shown in\n, the as-synthesized Ni–N–C-3 catalyst presents atomically dispersed nickel without observable nickel clusters. The colocation of nickel and nitrogen on the carbon support was also demonstrated by the STEM–EELS point spectrum \n). The highest nickel single-atom loading we can obtain is approximately 15 wt% (3.6 at.%; Supplementary \n) in Ni–N–C-3, which is at least twofold higher than previously reported Ni single-atom catalysts \n). As the nickel species can be readily dissolved in aqua regia solution, we then used inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry to double confirm the nickel atom loading. As a result, the inductively coupled plasma gives a nickel content of 15.4 ± 0.4 wt% for Ni–N–C-3, which is in good agreement with XPS and TGA estimations, confirming the high accuracy of the XPS and TGA methods for single-atom loading quantification.

Fine tuning of the quantum dot functional group, TM coordination environment and TM centre will be future directions to further increase the single-atom loading and improve the catalytic performances of single-atom catalysts in different reaction applications.\n\nsynthesis\nA modified molecular fusion route was employed to synthesize well-crystallized GQDs–NH\n\n.\nTypically, 8 grams of pyrene (Sigma, purity >98%) was nitrated into trinitropyrene in 640 millilitres of concentrated HNO\n\n(70%, Sigma) at 80 °C under refluxing and stirring for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was washed to neutral pH using deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ) by centrifuging. The resultant yellow 1,3,6-trinitropyrene was then dried under vacuum at room temperature. Next, 1.2 grams of dried 1,3,6-trinitropyrene powder were dispersed into a solution containing 220 millilitres of DI water and 20 millilitres of concentrated ammonia solution (30%, Sigma). The above mixture was ultrasonicated in ice water using a batch sonicator for 4 h. Sixty millilitres of the homogeneous suspension were transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 millilitres). The four autoclaves (total 240 millilitres mixture solution) were heated at 200 °C for 10 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, all the product-containing solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm microporous membrane to remove insoluble carbon product and further concentrated to ~90 millilitres by rotation drying. The concentrated solution was dialysed in a dialysis bag (retained molecular weight, ~12–14 kDa, Innovating Science) for two days to remove contamination and unfused small molecules. The concentration of purified GQDs–NH\n\nsolution was ~1 milligram per millilitre.\nIr–N–C-\n\nsynthesis\nFirst, to prepare the nitrogen-doped graphene support (GO–NH\n\n), GO (purchased from CYG and used as received) was mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10, and further heated in a tube furnace to 500 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 1 h, and then kept at the same temperature for another 2 h before cooling to room temperature. Then, Ir–GO–NH\n\n-\n\nsynthesis\nFirst, 1 gram of Ni(NO\n\n)\n\n∙6H\n\nO (Sigma) was dissolved into 200 millilitres of DI water to prepare the Ni(NO\n\n)\n\nstock solution with a concentration of ~5 milligrams per millilitre. Then, for the Ni–N–C sample with 15 wt% nickel, 3 millilitres of Ni(NO\n\n)\n\nstock solution was added to ~30 millilitres of purified GQDs–NH\n\nsolution (~30 milligrams of GQDs–NH\n\n), followed by sonication in ice water for 15 min. The above solution was freeze dried and mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10 and further heated in a tube furnace to 750 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 1 h, and then kept at the same temperature for another 1 h before cooling to room temperature. Finally, the as-prepared powder was collected for further characterization. To synthesize the Ni–N–C-\n\npreparation of GQDs–NH\n\nexcept 240 millilitres of 0.2 M NaOH solution was used to replace the previous ammonia solution (220 millilitres of DI plus 20 millilitres of concentrated ammonia). This is because the heavily nitrogen-doped carbon matrix will also promote the hydrogen evolution reaction. The as-prepared Ni–N–C-1.5 (~7.5 wt% Ni) and Ni–N–C-3 (~15 wt% Ni) single-atom catalysts from GQDs–OH were also verified using STEM.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41557-021-00734-x\nSource: main text file\n\nCatalyst synthesis\n\nAbstract\nTransition-metal single-atom catalysts present extraordinary activity per metal atomic site, but suffer from low metal-atom densities (typically less than 5 wt% or 1 at.%), which limits their overall catalytic performance.

Photoluminescence (PL) emission studies (Supplementary \n) of the as-prepared carbon suspension presents an excitation-dependent PL, confirming the successful preparation of GQDs\n\n. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and X-ray diffraction suggest that the GQDs are well crystallized, with a uniform size of ~6–8 nm \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Obviously, the GQDs with different particle sizes and functional groups could affect the metal loading of single-atom catalysts (details in Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). With the decreasing of the size of GQDs, the concentration of the surface functional group will be increased due to its enhanced surface/volume ratio and thus lead to a higher concentration of anchored single metal atoms. So, theoretically, the smaller it is, the better. However, if the size of GQDs is too small, effective steric hindrance cannot be provided to prevent the agglomeration of metal sites between different GQDs. The optimized size of the GQDs is within ~5–10 nm in our case. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the as-prepared GQDs shows a high nitrogen content of 10.8 at.% (Supplementary \n). Further deconvolution of the high-resolution N 1\ns\nspectrum (Supplementary \n) shows the contribution of the –NH\n\ngroup, N–C bond and a trace amount of residual –NO\n\ngroup at 399.2 eV, 400.3 eV and 405.4 eV, respectively\n\n,\n\n.

Specifically, different volumes of IrCl\n\nstock solution (5 milligrams per millilitre) were first added into 30 millilitres of GQDs–NH\n\nsolution (1 milligram per millilitre), henceforth referred to as Ir–N–C-\n\nx\nwhere\nx\nrepresents the IrCl\n\nvolume in millilitres, followed by freeze drying and pyrolysis. \nand Supplementary \nshow the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the GQDs–NH\n\nwith 7 millilitres of IrCl\n\nsolution after freeze drying, indicating a crosslinking and self-assembly process from well-dispersed GQDs–NH\n\nto layered bulk carbon structures, which agrees with previous reports\n\n,\n\n. This layered morphology was maintained after pyrolysis at 500 °C in argon, resulting in the Ir–N–C-7 final product (\n\nMethods\n, \nand Supplementary \n). Cl ligands were completely removed during this pyrolysis step as confirmed by XPS (Supplementary \n). The X-ray diffraction patterns of Ir–N–C catalysts with different iridium loadings show similar features of two broad peaks at approximately 19° and 38° \n), suggesting the formation of amorphous bulk carbon from GQD assembly after pyrolysis. No metallic iridium peaks were observed in Ir–N–C catalysts until ~60 wt% iridium loading (Ir–N–C-15), implying that high-loading atomically dispersed iridium catalyst could be obtained. Iridium quantification from XPS \n) reveals a quasi-linear increasing of iridium content from Ir–N–C-1 to Ir–N–C-7, followed by a nonlinear change of iridium content from Ir–N–C-8 to Ir–N–C-15 catalyst, which implies that uniform atomically dispersed iridium might be formed until the nominal iridium loading (\n\nMethods\n) of ~41 wt% (iridium content in Ir–N–C-7). This observation is consistent with the deconvolution of the high-resolution iridium 4\nf\nspectrum \n). Only an oxidized iridium specie in the form of Ir\nδ\n+\n(iridium 4\nf\n7/2\npeak at 61.9 eV) was detected until the Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, followed by the arising of metallic iridium (iridium 4\nf\n7/2\npeak at 60.8 eV) from Ir–N–C-8 to Ir–N–C-15 (\n). It is worthwhile to note that the oxidation state of iridium in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst is very close to that of IrO\n\n(+4), where the iridium 4\nf\n7/2\npeak of IrO\n\nis located at 61.6 eV (\n). According to the XPS results, our Ir–N–C-7 catalyst has an iridium loading of 37.6 wt% (3.84 at.%) and nitrogen content of 27.8 at.%, consistent with the nominal iridium loading of ~41 wt%.\nAberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was performed to investigate the distribution of iridium species at the atomic scale in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst. As illustrated in –d\n, densely while atomically dispersed iridium atoms on a highly porous carbon support were observed in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, with no clusters observed. The homogeneously dispersed bright spots are ~0.2 nm in size, matching with the theoretical size of metal atoms. The simultaneous acquisition of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results with the beam positioned on a bright atom, shown in Supplementary \n, revealed Ir, N and C and suggested possible coordination of Ir–N–C. EDS mapping analysis further demonstrates the homogeneous distribution of iridium, nitrogen and carbon (Supplementary \n) and gives an iridium content of 44.5 wt%. More importantly, a wide-range HAADF-STEM screening was performed to confirm that there are no iridium clusters or nanoparticles in high-loading Ir–N–C samples (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). However, nanoparticles were observed when the iridium loading was further increased to Ir–N–C-8 (Supplementary \n), agreeing well with the XPS analysis. Considering the limited solubility of iridium in corrosive aqua regia solution, we employed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to accurately obtain the iridium loading in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst of 41.6 ± 2.5 wt% (Supplementary \n). This result is consistent with the estimations by XPS (37.6 wt%) and EDS (44.5 wt%) and the nominal calculation (~41.5 wt%).\n\n, Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images of Ir–N–C-7 catalyst.

The simulated PDF for bulk iridium metal was used for comparison. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy and pair distribution function demonstrated that there is no iridium–iridium contribution in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst in the micrometre-scale and millimetre-scale ranges, respectively, confirming the formation of fully isolated iridium species in this sample.\nFull size image\nWith the confirmation of the atomic distribution of Ir down to the subnanometre scale by STEM characterization, we next employed X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) to study the electronic and coordination structures of iridium in high-loading Ir single-atom catalysts, such as the Ir–N–C-7 sample, at the micrometre scale. As shown in the Ir L\n\n-edge XANES spectra (Supplementary \n), the spectrum of Ir–N–C-7 was different from that of Ir foil and very similar to that of IrO\n\n, indicating a higher oxidation state of iridium in Ir–N–C-7. The EXAFS spectra of Ir–N–C-7 catalyst \n) presents a prominent peak at ~1.58 Å, which can be ascribed to the iridium–nitrogen/carbon coordination\n\n. No high-order peaks, such as the iridium–iridium interaction in Ir foil (~2.6 Å) and Ir–O–Ir in IrO\n\n, were observed, confirming that the iridium species in Ir–N–C-7 were dispersed as isolated single atoms. Further EXAFS fitting, as shown in Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n, suggested a possible relative uniform Ir–N\n\nconfiguration for the Ir sites of Ir–N–C-7 catalyst. Synchrotron-based pair distribution function (PDF) analysis was performed to further demonstrate the homogeneity of Ir–N–C-7 catalyst in the millimetre-scale range. The Ir–N–C-7 powders were loaded into 0.9-millilitre-inner-diameter Kapton capillaries for PDF measurement using an X-ray radiation of wavelength 0.21062 Å. \nand Supplementary \nshow the PDF spectra of Ir–N–C-7, suggesting a highly amorphous material with a structural correlation up to only 7 Å. The peaks located at 1.35 and 2.02 Å represent the C–C/N bonds and the Ir–C/N bonds, respectively. No iridium–iridium interaction, which is expected at 2.7 Å, was observed in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, indicating the atomic dispersion of iridium across the whole range of Ir–N–C-7 single-atom catalyst. The above discussed multi-scale characterization results, taken together, lead to a solid conclusion that Ir single-atom catalyst with a high loading of up to ~40 wt% was successfully synthesized.\nTo monitor the synthesis transition of the GQDs–NH\n\n/Ir\n3+\nmixture to the single-atom Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, we first examined the sample using ex-situ X-ray diffraction under different temperatures, which represent different synthesis phases. As shown in Supplementary \n, the GQDs started to get fused at 300 °C to form an amorphous bulk carbon, indicated by the emerging of a broad peak at around 19° as well as the decreasing of the intensity of the GQD peak. The amorphization transition might be due to the heavy incorporation of nitrogen and iridium atoms into the GQD lattice under high temperature. With the temperature further increased, the peak of the GQDs completely disappeared, and two broad peaks at approximately 19° and 38° (Supplementary \n) emerged, suggesting the full formation of amorphous bulk carbon from GQD assembly after pyrolysis. No metallic iridium peaks were observed in Ir–N–C-7 catalysts. Ex-situ XPS study (Supplementary \n) reveals that the oxidation state of Ir gradually increases from 300 °C to 500 °C, which also implies that the Ir\n3+\nstabilized by the amine functional group in the GQDs–NH\n\n/Ir\n3+\nmixture gradually coordinated with the lattice nitrogen and carbon to form more stable Ir–N\n\na\n–C motif. A scheme (Supplementary \n) was employed to illustrate the synthesis of high-loading Ir–N–C-7 catalyst. Initially, the Ir\n3+\natoms were stably absorbed on the GQDs–NH\n\nsurface by the strong chelation/complexation effect between metal cations and amine groups. With the temperature continuing to increase, the small GQDs started to interconnect and then to form a three-dimensional bulk carbon that can be directly used for practical applications. Simultaneously, the surface nitrogen will be in-situ doped into the GQD lattice under high temperature, and thus help to trap the isolated Ir atoms to form the Ir–N\n\na\n–C coordination. As a result, the oxidation state of Ir will increase after the formation of the Ir–N\na\n–C motif. The thermal stability of the GQDs is the key point to avoid the formation of Ir nanoclusters or particles. While the heavy incorporation of nitrogen and iridium atoms leads to less lattice periodicity of GQDs, they do not undergo a complete deconstruction during pyrolysis, which was demonstrated by the TEM study under different temperatures (Supplementary \n). Thus, it can provide a stable and large spacing between TM atoms to avoid aggregation.\nWe further demonstrated that another carbon substrate with similar high nitrogen dopants cannot deliver the same products. Specifically, we first synthesized nitrogen-doped graphene using graphene oxide (GO) as the starting material (Supplementary \n). The as-synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon (GO–NH\n\n) shows a very high nitrogen content of ~20 at.% (Supplementary \n). The GO–NH\n\nwas used as the support to synthesize the Ir single-atom catalyst, following the same process as for Ir–N–C-7 synthesis. However, we found that even if the loading of Ir is less than 10 wt%, nanoparticles will be formed (Supplementary \n), showing obvious metallic Ir X-ray diffraction peaks. This observation reveals that a high-loading Ir single-atom catalyst could not be obtained using the carbon support with only a high level of nitrogen dopant, demonstrating the unique role of the GQDs. While GO–NH\n\nis as stable as GQDs during pyrolysis, it shows a very low surface-to-volume ratio, providing limited anchor sites. As the intermediate carbon support, GQDs are unique since they can supply numerous surface anchoring sites for large loadings of isolated metal atoms, and they are stable enough during pyrolysis to prevent the isolated atom aggregation.\n\nSynthesis of other single-atom catalysts\nTo validate if our GQD-assisted synthesis method can be extended to synthesize other TM single-atom catalysts with high metal loadings, we first replaced the iridium precursor with platinum to prepare Pt–N–C single-atom catalysts.\n\nand Supplementary \nexhibit the HAADF-STEM images of Pt–N–C-6 catalyst with a nominal platinum content of ~32.3 wt% (\n\nMethods\n). Densely dispersed Pt single atoms were observed without any nanoclusters or particles, suggesting the successful extension from iridium to different noble metal centres. The EDS elemental mapping shows the uniform distribution of platinum, nitrogen and carbon in Pt–N–C-6 (Supplementary \n). The EELS and EDS scans on a single platinum site (Supplementary \n) further reveal the expected platinum, nitrogen and carbon signals in Pt–N–C-6. The deconvolution of platinum 4\nf\nspectra (Supplementary \n) demonstrates that the isolated platinum in Pt–N–C-6 catalyst is in the oxidized valence state, with the Pt 4\nf\n7/2\npeak located at 72.5 eV, which is higher than that of metallic Pt (4\nf\n7/2\nat 71.1 eV)\n\n. No metallic platinum signal was detected by XPS.\n\n, Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image of Ni–N–C-3 catalyst with ~15 wt% Ni, demonstrating that isolated nickel atoms were uniformly immobilized onto the carbon support.

The simulated PDF spectra for bulk nickel metal was included for comparison. The peak at ~1.41 Å is due to the C–C bonds in graphite. Two overlapped peaks at approximately 1.8 to 2.0 Å can be ascribed to the Ni–N and Ni–C contributions. Another prominent peak at ~2.5 Å originates from the second nearest neighbour C–C distances. The PDF clearly demonstrates that the nickel species are in isolated environments and coordinate with nitrogen in as-prepared 15 wt% Ni–N–C catalyst.\ng\n, The steady-state current densities (\nj\n) and the corresponding Faradaic efficiencies of CO (FE\nCO\n) of ~7.5 wt% Ni–N–C and ~15 wt% Ni–N–C catalyst in an anion membrane electrode assembly (MEA).

As shown in\n, the as-synthesized Ni–N–C-3 catalyst presents atomically dispersed nickel without observable nickel clusters. The colocation of nickel and nitrogen on the carbon support was also demonstrated by the STEM–EELS point spectrum \n). The highest nickel single-atom loading we can obtain is approximately 15 wt% (3.6 at.%; Supplementary \n) in Ni–N–C-3, which is at least twofold higher than previously reported Ni single-atom catalysts \n). As the nickel species can be readily dissolved in aqua regia solution, we then used inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry to double confirm the nickel atom loading. As a result, the inductively coupled plasma gives a nickel content of 15.4 ± 0.4 wt% for Ni–N–C-3, which is in good agreement with XPS and TGA estimations, confirming the high accuracy of the XPS and TGA methods for single-atom loading quantification.

Synchrotron-based PDF\n\nand Supplementary \n) further confirms the nickel single-atom dispersion across the whole sample region. The above results confirm that tuning the metal active site is routinely achievable, demonstrating the generality of our synthetic strategy for high-loading TM single-atom catalysts.\nElectrochemical CO\n\nreduction on Ni single-atom catalyst\nNi single-atom catalysts have shown high selectivity in electrochemical CO\n\nreduction to CO, but limited activity due to the low Ni density\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. As a representative case study, we compare the CO\n\nreduction performances on as-prepared Ni–N–C-1.5 (~7.5 wt% Ni) and Ni–N–C-3 (~15 wt% Ni) catalysts with the same catalyst mass loading but different nickel atom loadings. To overcome the CO\n\ndiffusion limitation in the H-cell reactor and the flooding issue of the gas diffusion electrode in the flow cell reactor, we utilized an anion-exchange membrane electrode assembly (\n\nMethods\n) to investigate the impact of Ni single-atom loading on CO\n\nreduction performance\n\n. As shown in \nand Supplementary \n, while both ~7.5 wt% Ni–N–C-1.5 and ~15 wt% Ni–N–C-3 show an outstanding CO selectivity of over 90%, their activities differ dramatically. Specifically, under a cell voltage of ~2.55 V, ~15 wt% Ni–N–C-3 catalyst can deliver a CO partial current of 122 mA cm\n−2\n, which represents a 2.5-fold improvement from ~7.5 wt% Ni–N–C-1.5 \n). In addition, we performed HADDF-STEM analysis on the postcatalysed Ni–N–C-3 catalyst (Supplementary \n). We did not observe any agglomeration during the CO\n\nreduction reaction, demonstrating the good stability of our high-loading single-atom catalysts. This result clearly demonstrates the advantage of high single-atom loadings in improving single-atom catalysis.\nPushing the metal loading in single-atom catalysts to the limit will play a critical role in the catalysts’ practical applications. Our GQD-assisted synthesis strategy sets up a limit of TM single-atom density before the formation of clusters or nanoparticles. Fine tuning of the quantum dot functional group, TM coordination environment and TM centre will be future directions to further increase the single-atom loading and improve the catalytic performances of single-atom catalysts in different reaction applications.\n\nMethods\nGQDs–NH\n\nsynthesis\nA modified molecular fusion route was employed to synthesize well-crystallized GQDs–NH\n\n.\nTypically, 8 grams of pyrene (Sigma, purity >98%) was nitrated into trinitropyrene in 640 millilitres of concentrated HNO\n\n(70%, Sigma) at 80 °C under refluxing and stirring for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was washed to neutral pH using deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ) by centrifuging. The resultant yellow 1,3,6-trinitropyrene was then dried under vacuum at room temperature. Next, 1.2 grams of dried 1,3,6-trinitropyrene powder were dispersed into a solution containing 220 millilitres of DI water and 20 millilitres of concentrated ammonia solution (30%, Sigma). The above mixture was ultrasonicated in ice water using a batch sonicator for 4 h. Sixty millilitres of the homogeneous suspension were transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 millilitres). The four autoclaves (total 240 millilitres mixture solution) were heated at 200 °C for 10 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, all the product-containing solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm microporous membrane to remove insoluble carbon product and further concentrated to ~90 millilitres by rotation drying. The concentrated solution was dialysed in a dialysis bag (retained molecular weight, ~12–14 kDa, Innovating Science) for two days to remove contamination and unfused small molecules. The concentration of purified GQDs–NH\n\nsolution was ~1 milligram per millilitre.\nIr–N–C-\n\nx\nH\n\nO (Alfa Aesar) was dissolved into 200 millilitres of DI water to prepare the IrCl\n\nstock solution with a concentration of ~5 milligrams per millilitre. For the Ir–N–C-7 sample, 7 millilitres of IrCl\n\nstock solution were added to ~30 millilitres of purified GQDs–NH\n\nsolution (~30 milligrams of GQDs–NH\n\n). Then, the mixture solution was sonicated in ice water for 15 min, followed by being quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. After freeze drying, the as-prepared aerogel-like powder was mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10 and further heated in a tube furnace to 500 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 1 h, and kept at the same temperature for another 2 h before cooling to room temperature. Finally, the Ir–N–C-7 powder was collected for further characterizations. For other Ir–N–C-\nx\ncatalyst syntheses, only the volume of IrCl\n\nstock solution was changed; for example 1 millilitre of IrCl\n\nstock solution was used to prepared Ir–N–C-1 catalyst. The nominal Ir loading was defined using following equation:\n\\(\\frac{{{\\mathrm{Mass}}_{{\\mathrm{added}} - {\\mathrm{Ir}}} \\ ({\\mathrm{mg}})}}{{{\\mathrm{Mass}}_{{\\mathrm{added}} - {\\mathrm{Ir}}}\\left( {\\mathrm{mg}} \\right) + {\\mathrm{Mass}}_{\\mathrm{GQDs}} \\ ({\\mathrm{mg}})}} \\times 100{\\mathrm{\\% }}\\)\n, where Mass\nadded–Ir\nand Mass\nGQDs\nare the masses of the added Ir and the GQDs, respectively.\nIr–GO–NH\n\n-\nx\nsynthesis\nFirst, to prepare the nitrogen-doped graphene support (GO–NH\n\n), GO (purchased from CYG and used as received) was mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10, and further heated in a tube furnace to 500 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 1 h, and then kept at the same temperature for another 2 h before cooling to room temperature. Then, Ir–GO–NH\n\n-\n\nx\nwas synthesized by following the same process as for Ir–N–C-\nx\ncatalyst using the GO–NH\n\nas the support instead of GQDs–NH\n\n.\nPt–N–C-6 synthesis\nFirst, 1 gram of H\n\nPtCl\n\n(Sigma) was dissolved into 200 millilitres of DI water to prepare the H\n\nPtCl\n\nstock solution with a concentration of 5 milligrams per millilitre. Then, 6 millilitres of H\n\nPtCl\n\nstock solution was added to ~30 millilitres of purified GQDs–NH\n\nsolution (~30 milligrams of GQDs–NH\n\n), followed by sonication in ice water for 15 min. The above solution was freeze dried and mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10, and further heated in a tube furnace to 500 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 2 h, and then kept at the same temperature for another 1 h before cooling to room temperature. Finally, the Pt–N–C-6 powder was collected for further characterization. The nominal Pt loading was defined using the following equation:\n\\(\\frac{{{\\mathrm{Mass}}_{{\\mathrm{added}} - {\\mathrm{Pt}}} \\ ({\\mathrm{mg}})}}{{{\\mathrm{Mass}}_{{\\mathrm{added}} - {\\mathrm{Pt}}}\\left( {\\mathrm{mg}} \\right) + {\\mathrm{Mass}}_{{\\mathrm{GQDs}}} \\ ({\\mathrm{mg}})}} \\times 100{\\mathrm{\\% }}\\)\n, where Mass\nadded–Pt\nis the mass of the added Pt.\nNi–N–C-\nx\nsynthesis\nFirst, 1 gram of Ni(NO\n\n)\n\n∙6H\n\nO (Sigma) was dissolved into 200 millilitres of DI water to prepare the Ni(NO\n\n)\n\nstock solution with a concentration of ~5 milligrams per millilitre. Then, for the Ni–N–C sample with 15 wt% nickel, 3 millilitres of Ni(NO\n\n)\n\nstock solution was added to ~30 millilitres of purified GQDs–NH\n\nsolution (~30 milligrams of GQDs–NH\n\n), followed by sonication in ice water for 15 min. The above solution was freeze dried and mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10 and further heated in a tube furnace to 750 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 1 h, and then kept at the same temperature for another 1 h before cooling to room temperature. Finally, the as-prepared powder was collected for further characterization. To synthesize the Ni–N–C-\n\nx\ncatalysts for the electrochemical CO\n\nreduction test, only 30 milligrams of GQDs–NH\n\nwas replaced using 30 milligrams of GQDs–OH. To prepare GQDs–OH, all the processes are the same as in the preparation of GQDs–NH\n\nexcept 240 millilitres of 0.2 M NaOH solution was used to replace the previous ammonia solution (220 millilitres of DI plus 20 millilitres of concentrated ammonia). This is because the heavily nitrogen-doped carbon matrix will also promote the hydrogen evolution reaction. The as-prepared Ni–N–C-1.5 (~7.5 wt% Ni) and Ni–N–C-3 (~15 wt% Ni) single-atom catalysts from GQDs–OH were also verified using STEM."

A calculated amount of the original or substituted NiPc/CoPc was dissolved in 10 ml DMF with high-power sonication and added to the CNT suspension. The mixed suspension was sonicated for another 30 min and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. NiPc has low solubility in DMF, and thus the high-power sonication step is important for mixing.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mappings further supported that the nickel and nitrogen in the NiPc molecules were uniformly distributed on the CNTs (Supplementary \n). These results confirmed molecular dispersion of original and substituted NiPcs that contain Ni–N\n\nsites on the CNTs, which could serve as model Ni–N–C catalysts with well-defined structures.\nThe NiPc MDEs were deposited on carbon fibre paper (CFP) substrates with a catalyst loading of 0.4 mg cm\n−2\n(0.03 mg cm\n−2\nof NiPc) before being measured in a gas-tight H-type cell for the CO\n\nRR. All potentials were converted to versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with iR corrections. In a CO\n\n-saturated 0.5 M KHCO\n\nelectrolyte, cathodic currents were observed from linear-sweep voltammetry with an onset potential (where the reduction current density reaches 0.1 mA cm\n−2\n) of −0.43 V using NiPc MDE \nand Supplementary \n). By contrast, neat NiPc (directly deposited on CFP from a DMF suspension without being supported on CNTs) with the same metal loading (0.03 mg cm\n−2\nof NiPc) showed no appreciable electrocatalytic activity, similar to blank CFP substrates (Supplementary \n). Increasing the neat NiPc loading to 0.4 mg cm\n−2\nimproved the activities, but they were still much lower than NiPc MDE (Supplementary \n). The low activity of the neat NiPc electrodes can be attributed to the aggregation of the NiPc molecules (Supplementary \n) and, consequently, fewer exposed active sites and inferior electron transport from the electrode to the active site to drive the reaction. Introducing electron-withdrawing cyano groups to prepare NiPc–CN MDE afforded a positive shift (50 mV) in the onset potential (Supplementary \n) and improved CO\n\nRR activities in comparison with those of NiPc MDE \n). Although electron-donating methoxy-substituted NiPc–OMe MDE showed a slightly more negative onset potential (Supplementary \n), its activities became higher than NiPc MDE at more negative potentials \n).\nChronoamperometric measurements were carried out at different potentials to obtain product distributions. Carbon monoxide was the only gaseous product from the CO\n\nRR, with H\n\nas the by-product from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Faradaic efficiencies of CO and H\n\n(FE(CO) and FE(H\n\n), respectively) from NiPc MDEs were plotted in \nand Supplementary \n. In the reduction current density range of ~1.5 to ~22 mA cm\n−2\n(where mass transport limitation of CO\n\nis not important)\n\n, FE(CO)s of the NiPc MDEs were greater than 96%, suggesting high CO selectivity of the CO\n\nRR. Impressive FE(CO)s (>99%) were obtained with the NiPc–OMe MDE throughout the current density range (potential range of −0.54 to −0.68 V) \n). To compare, we synthesized a pyrolysed Ni–N–C catalyst with atomically dispersed nickel (P-NiNC)\n\nand observed lower reduction currents and lower FE(CO)s (for example, ~90% at −0.62 V) than the NiPc MDE under identical testing conditions ,d\nand Supplementary \n). This was probably due to the competing HER active sites generated during high-temperature treatment of the pyrolysed catalyst\n\n.\nThe CO\n\nRR stability by NiPc MDEs was also investigated by chronoamperometric measurements. The original NiPc MDE exhibited unstable electrocatalytic performance especially at high reduction current densities \nand Supplementary \n). Note that the previously reported inferior FE(CO)s of NiPc hybridized with CNTs to the CoPc counterpart at more negative potentials (<−0.8 V versus RHE)\n\ncould be attributed to this fast deactivation of original NiPc at high reduction current densities. Similar decay was also observed in pyrolysed Ni–N–C catalysts\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. The NiPc–CN MDE, although operated at lower overpotentials, still suffered from stability issues \nand Supplementary \n). By contrast, the methoxy-substituted NiPc–OMe MDE exhibited much more stable CO\n\nRR activities at reduction current densities of up to 22.3 mA cm\n−2\n\nand Supplementary \n). These results showed that pendant group functionalization of NiPc molecules can tune the electrocatalytic activity, selectivity and stability of NiPc MDEs. Through molecular synthesis/screening and dispersing/anchoring on CNTs, we identified methoxy functionalized NiPc–OME MDE for an active, selective and stable CO\n\nRR (Supplementary \n).\n\nNiPc MDEs in GDEs\nTo investigate high-current performance for the CO\n\nRR electrolyser, we incorporated NiPc MDEs to fabricate GDEs (see Supplementary \nfor the experimental set-up and\n\nMethods\nfor details). Gas diffusion electrodes benefit from the fast diffusion of CO\n\nthrough the gas-phase to the catalyst (rather than through the electrolyte in conventional H-type cells) improving the mass transfer during the reaction and affording large operation currents (>150 mA cm\n−2\n) for the CO\n\nRR\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. The GDE cell included a vigorously stirred liquid electrolyte at the cathode compartment to ensure a well-mixed electrolyte and enable three-electrode measurements that would reveal the CO\n\nRR performance of the catalysts. NiPc MDEs were coated on the microporous gas diffusion layers (GDLs) with a catalyst loading of 1.0 mg cm\n−2\nand 1.0 M KHCO\n\nwas used as the electrolyte. The GDE with NiPc–OMe MDE could be operated at current densities from −10 to −400 mA cm\n−2\n, with modest overpotentials \nand Supplementary \n). Remarkably high FE(CO)s of >99.8% were obtained from −10 to −300 mA cm\n−2\n(see \n, Supplementary \nand Supplementary \nfor performance summaries at various current densities). Note that polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was incorporated into the catalyst layer to render hydrophobicity and enhance the diffusion of CO\n\nto the active sites to achieve high reduction current densities (Supplementary \n). Addition of PTFE to electrodes of neat MPcs slightly increased the CO\n\nRR selectivity and overpotentials compared with electrodes that were prepared without PTFE, but stable operations at reduction current densities >100 mA cm\n−2\nstill could not be achieved in both cases (Supplementary \n), inferior to their MDE counterparts.\n\nelectrolyte.

The error bars represent standard deviations of three measurements and the dashed lines are guides to the eye.\nc\n, Long-term operation of NiPc–OMe MDE at −150 mA cm\n−2\n.\nSource data\nFull size image\nThe selective electrocatalysts for the CO\n\nRR to CO reaction reported previously generally exhibited FE(CO)s of less than 97% at moderate current densities (see Supplementary \nfor a comparison with previous reports), and considerably lower selectivities at low and high current densities \n)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. For example, the FE(CO)s of a pyrolysed Ni–N–C catalyst dropped to below 80% beyond 250 mA cm\n−2\n(\n), and a gold-based catalyst exhibited FE(CO)s below 83% and 90% at current densities <25 and >300 mA cm\n−2\n, respectively\n\n. The high selectivities over a wide range of current densities obtained with NiPc–OMe MDE (FE(CO)s >99% from −10 to −400 mA cm\n−2\n) were enabled by the high intrinsic selectivities together with the well-defined structures of the Ni–N\n\nsites, which is exceptional and unprecedented when compared with reported CO\n\nRR-to-CO catalysts. Long-term operation at −150 mA cm\n−2\nwith NiPc–OMe MDE showed stable potentials at around −0.61 V for 40 h and FE(CO)s of >99.5% were maintained during the whole process \n). This performance was better than the reported FE(CO)s of ~90% with a carbonate-derived silver catalyst in 1 M KOH electrolyte (which required refreshing the electrolyte around every 20 h) for 100 h (\n) and decreasing FE(CO)s from ~88% to 80% in 20 h with a pyrolysed Ni–N–C catalyst\n\nat similar current densities. At −400 mA cm\n−2\n, flooding of NiPc–OMe MDE electrodes by the electrolyte was observed, resulting in large fluctuation of the voltage and slight decrease of FE(CO)s to 99.1% in the 40 min measurement (Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). Prolonged operation at −400 mA cm\n−2\nresulted in electrode failure due to the flooding issue, which could be solved by improved design of GDE structures to enable stable operation at even higher current densities\n\n. Although NiPc–CN MDE exhibited lower overpotentials than NiPc–OMe MDE at reduction current densities <200 mA cm\n−2\n\n), its activities and selectivities decayed in less than 3 h at −150 mA cm\n−2\n(Supplementary \n).\nThe turnover frequency (TOF) of NiPc–OMe MDE at −150 mA cm\n−2\nwas calculated to be 12 s\n−1\n(assuming that all of the nickel sites were electrocatalytically active), which, to the best of our knowledge, would be a record TOF value at similar current densities and much higher than the reported TOF of ~0.22 s\n−1\nwith aggregated CoPc\n\n. Although exhibiting slightly higher performance than neat NiPc-based molecules (Supplementary Figs.\n17–19\n, possibly due to better charge transport), neat CoPc tested at identical conditions was inferior to NiPc–OMe MDE ,b\n). Molecular modification of CoPc showed slight enhancement in performance, which could be operated at −75 mA cm\n−2\nfor 10 h with increasing overpotentials\n\n. Dispersing CoPc on CNTs to synthesize CoPc MDE also enhanced the activities compared to aggregated molecules (Supplementary \n), but the product selectivity and stability was still inferior to NiPc–OMe MDE, showing that FE(CO)s decreased from ~97% to below 90% in 20 h at −150 mA cm\n−2\n(Supplementary \n). With the high activities, selectivities and stabilities of NiPc–OMe MDE at large current densities, it could be readily incorporated into practical CO\n\nRR electrolysers (Supplementary \n).\nMechanistic insights of NiPc MDEs\nSupporting NiPc molecules on CNTs allows for molecular dispersion of well-defined active sites for electrocatalysis and facilitates evolutions of the catalysts as the highly dispersed molecules are electrochemically accessible. Otherwise, it is difficult to eludicate the correlation between molecular structure and catalytic activities for aggregated heterogeneous molecular catalysts (as in neat NiPc, NiPc–OMe, NiPc–CN; Supplementary \n). To understand how molecular engineering modulates the electrocatalytic properties of NiPc MDEs, we conducted in situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements\n\n,\n\nand density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the electronic structures and catalytic behaviours of NiPc MDEs.\nCyclic voltammetries of NiPc MDEs were first performed in argon-saturated 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) electrolyte to characterize the electrochemical behaviour of original and substituted NiPc MDEs without the impact from CO\n\nRR intermediates. Two reduction peaks at −0.01 and −0.64 V were observed on NiPc MDE (Supplementary \n). The second reduction peak of NiPc–CN MDE shifted positively to −0.22 V, whereas it shifted negatively to −0.69 V on NiPc–OMe MDE. Both the first and second reduction peaks of NiPc molecules were assigned to ligand reduction, in accordance with previous reports\n\n. The occurrence of the second reduction peaks in our NiPc MDEs coincided with the onset of CO\n\nRR activities, suggesting that the reduced NiPc molecules were responsible for them.\nThe molecular dispersion of catalyst molecules in the MDEs provides an excellent platform to investigate the real active sites by in situ/operando XAS, as most of the metal centres with well-defined structures were electrochemically accessible. In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at the nickel K-edge of NiPc MDE showed a small shift of ~0.75 eV to lower energy in the rising edge region (~8,344 eV) when held at −0.68 V in argon-saturated 0.1 M phosphate buffer compared with those held at the open-circuit voltage (OCV) and at −0.37 V \n), indicating that the first reduction was located on the phthalocyanine ligand, whereas the second reduction was partially on the nickel centres. Band edge shifts to lower energy were also observed at −0.37 and −0.72 V for NiPc–CN MDE and NiPc–OMe MDE, respectively \nand Supplementary \n). The partially reduced nickel centres from in situ XANES spectra (Supplementary \n) and the positive/negative shifts of reduction peaks from cyclic voltammetry scans (Supplementary \n) suggested that tuning of the nickel electron density with the introduction of electron-withdrawing/donating groups was successful.\n\n-free (argon-saturated) 0.1 M phosphate buffer.

The dashed lines show the peak positions of NiPc MDEs at the most negative measured potentials.\nFull size image\nNiPc MDEs were further characterized in CO\n\n-saturated 0.5 M KHCO\n\nelectrolyte to gain information under the CO\n\nRR condition. The XANES and its first derivative spectra of NiPc MDE showed slight band edge shift to lower energy (~8,346 eV) when the CO\n\nRR was operated at −0.53 V (around −1 mA cm\n−2\n) and became more obvious at −0.68 V (around −5 mA cm\n−2\n) compared with that at OCV ,c\n), suggesting a partial reduction of the nickel centre. The pre-edge peak at ~8,336 eV (a signature of the square-planar Ni–N\n\nstructure in NiPc\n\n) was weakened under both −0.53 V and −0.68 V, indicating structural distortion of the Ni–N\n\nsites\n\n. An additional component at ~1.9 Å (no phase correction) in the Fourier transforms of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS-FT) was observed at −0.68 V (Supplementary \n), which was not observed from the same catalyst in the CO\n\n-free phosphate buffer electrolyte at −0.68 V (Supplementary \n). Quantitative fitting of the EXAFS spectra in R space suggested four Ni–N bonds (bond lengths of 1.91 Å) together with one new Ni–C bond at 2.06 Å under the CO\n\nRR condition at −0.68 V (Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). The new Ni–C bond can be assigned to adsorbed reaction intermediates on the nickel centres\n\n. The ratio of the coordination numbers of the Ni–N and Ni–C bonds was ~4, indicating that most of the nickel centres had an adsorbed intermediate under the steady state of the CO\n\nRR.\nA more profound change was found on NiPc–CN MDE operating at −0.58 V (around −5 mA cm\n−2\n). The pre-edge peak at ~8,336 eV disappeared and the first EXAFS-FT peak split into a doublet \nand Supplementary \n), suggesting distortion from/decomposition of the Ni−N\n\nstructure during the CO\n\nRR. Holding the electrode at the OCV after reaction only partially restored the spectral shape and the pre-edge peak compared with the fresh NiPc–CN MDE electrode (Supplementary \n), indicating an irreversible degradation of the nickel centres. Such decomposition could be the origin of instability of the NiPc MDE and NiPc–CN MDE catalysts (Supplementary \n)\n\n. By contrast, only slight changes in the oxidation state and coordination environment of the nickel centres were observed when holding NiPc–OMe MDE at −0.53 and −0.65 V, with current densities of approximately −1 and −5 mA cm\n−2\n, respectively ,c\nand Supplementary ,f\n), indicating its resistance to structural changes. This is consistent with its better electrochemical stability.\nKohn–Sham molecular orbital analysis revealed that the doubly degenerated lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of NiPc were mainly located on the phthalocyanine ligand with minor contribution from the nickel centre \nand Supplementary \n). Our theoretical results were consistent with the small change of nickel oxidation state observed in in-situ/operando XAS with the formation of reduced NiPc molecules. The LUMO energy level of NiPc shifted from −2.70 eV to −4.63 eV with the introduction of electron-withdrawing cyano groups, whereas it shifted positively to −2.40 eV with electron-donating methoxy groups \n), agreeing with the observed order of reduction potentials from cyclic voltammetry scans. In addition, Mulliken population analysis indicated the creation of electron-rich and electron-deficient environments of nickel in NiPc–OMe and NiPc–CN compared to NiPc, respectively (Supplementary \n).\n\n, Calculated electron density distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and doubly degenerated LUMO/LUMO+1 of NiPc and the energy levels of HOMO and LUMO/LUMO+1 of NiPc-OMe, NiPc and NiPc–CN.\nb\n, Calculated free energy diagram of NiPc–CN H\n\n, NiPc-H\n\nand NiPc–OMe-H\n\ncatalysing CO\n\nRR at −0.11 V versus RHE.

NiPc–OMe shows the strongest Ni–N bond, which could enhance its stability in CO\n\nRR.\nFull size image\nThe Gibbs free energy diagram of the CO\n\nRR on NiPc from DFT calculations showed that the adsorption of CO\n\non the active nickel centre was accompanied by a proton-coupled electron transfer step to generate *COOH, which was the rate-determining step. *COOH experienced a subsequent proton-coupled electron transfer step to form *CO and then desorbed to regenerate the free active site \n). The reduction of NiPc, coupled with proton transfers to generate NiPc-H and NiPc-H\n\n, markedly facilitated the rate-determining step due to the stabilization of *COOH, revealing the correlation between the formation of reduced NiPc catalysts and CO\n\nRR activities (Supplementary \n). Although NiPc–OMe-H\n\nrequired the least energy to generate *COOH from the free energy diagram, NiPc–CN-H\n\nwas generated with the least negative potential and exhibited the highest initial activities in CO\n\nRR\n\n. To be specific, the overpotential needed to drive the reaction relied on the reduction of NiPc molecules rather than the free energy change of elementary steps with NiPc catalysts, indicating the limitations of interpreting the activities of molecular catalysts solely on the basis of the calculated free energy diagram. Furthermore, the calculated highly positive free energy change required for the formation of adsorbed hydrogen intermediate during the HER (Supplementary \n) suggested the preferred high selectivities towards CO\n\nRR of NiPc MDEs. In addition, the calculated Ni–C bond length of CO adsorbed on reduced NiPc (2.04 Å, Supplementary \n) was consistent with the new Ni–C bond (2.06 Å) observed from quantitative fitting of the EXAFS spectra of NiPc MDE under the CO\n\nRR (Supplementary \n).\nAnalysis of Ni–N bond orders in NiPc molecules showed that NiPc–OMe possessed the strongest Ni–N bonds \n), consistent with the resistance to structural changes during the CO\n\nRR of NiPc–OMe MDE observed in operando XAS \n). The strengthened Ni–N bonds and favoured CO desorption \n) with methoxy substituents can synergistically enhance the electrochemical stability of NiPc–OMe MDE and make it a stable CO\n\nRR catalyst.\nWith the help of in situ/operando XAS and DFT calculations, knowledge of how ligand groups affect the properties of the active nickel centres was obtained. The electron-withdrawing CN groups decrease the electron density on the nickel centres, which facilitates the formation of a reduced active centre to enhance the electrocatalytic activities of NiPc–CN MDE at low overpotentials. But it still suffers from decaying activities due to structural instability at high overpotentials. By contrast with the electron-withdrawing CN groups, the electron-donating OMe groups enhance the Ni–N bond strength in the Ni–N\n\nsites and accelerate CO desorption compared with the original NiPc MDE to improve the catalyst stability, a critical figure of merit for a practical CO\n\nRR electrolyser. The OMe substitution also stabilizes the *COOH intermediate to further enhance the selectivity towards CO\n\nRR over HER.\nConclusions\nMolecular dispersion of NiPc molecules unlocked remarkable electrocatalytic properties for the CO\n\nRR from molecular aggregates. With the fine-tuning of pendant groups on the phthalocyanine ligand, NiPc–OMe MDE exhibited FE(CO)s of >99.5% over a wide current density range of −10 to −300 mA cm\n−2\nand stable performance at the practically relevant −150 mA cm\n−2\nfor 40 h. These results also emphasize that MDE cooperating with molecular engineering such as pendant group functionalization is a powerful strategy for designing affordable catalysts for critical electrochemical transformations.\n\nSynthesis of NiPc–OMe\nThe synthesis followed a two-step procedure with modifications\n\n,\n\n. 4-Nitrophthalonitrile (4 g) and 10 ml of methanol were added to 60 ml of DMF, followed by addition of potassium carbonate (K\n\nCO\n\n, 8 g). The reaction mixture was then heated to 70 °C and kept for 3 h with magnetic stirring and argon protection. The black mixture was then partitioned between water (150 ml) and dichloromethane (DCM, 150 ml). The aqueous phase was separated and extracted with DCM (200 ml × 3). The solvents of the combined organic phase were removed under reduced pressure and the product was purified by flash chromatography with DCM as the eluent to give 4-methoxyphthalonitrile (2.7 g, 73% yield). 4-Methoxyphthalonitrile (2.7 g) and nickel acetate tetrahydrate (1.35 g) were then added to a Schlenk flask equipped with a stir bar, followed by adding 50 ml of sulfolane. After several cycles of vacuum and refilling with argon, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (0.6 ml) was added, followed by another three cycles of vacuum and refilling with argon. The reaction mixture was heated to 160 °C and kept for 10 h. The mixture was then precipitated from methanol (400 ml) and the collected solid was subjected to Soxhlet extraction. The solid was further extracted by DMF several times and the solvent of combined DMF solutions was removed to obtain NiPc–OMe (600 mg, 18% yield).

Analysis: C\n\nH\n\nO\n\nN\n\nNi, 690.12685.\n\nSynthesis of NiPc–CN\nThe synthesis followed a one-step procedure with modifications\n\n. 1,2,4,5-Tetracyanobenzene (1.0 g) and nickel acetate tetrahydrate (0.4 g) were added to a Schlenk flask equipped with a stirring bar, followed by adding 20 ml of sulfolane. After several cycles of vacuum and refilling with argon, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (0.2 ml) was added, followed by another three cycles of vacuum and refilling with argon. The reaction mixture was heated to 135 °C and kept for 6 h. The reaction mixture was precipitated from methanol (400 ml) and the collected solid was subjected to Soxhlet extraction. The solid was further extracted by DMF for several times and the solvent of combined DMF solutions was removed to yield NiPc–CN (410 mg, 38% yield). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (\n\nm\n/\nz\n): 770.04838 (M\n+\n). Analysis: C\n\nH\n\nN\n\nNi, 770.04768.\n\nPreparation of MPc MDEs\nNiPc and CoPc were obtained from Alfa Aesar. To prepare MPc MDEs, 30 mg CNTs (C-Nano, FT 9000) were dispersed in 20 ml DMF by high-power sonication for 1 h (Xinzhi SB-5200D, 360 W). A calculated amount of the original or substituted NiPc/CoPc was dissolved in 10 ml DMF with high-power sonication and added to the CNT suspension. The mixed suspension was sonicated for another 30 min and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. NiPc has low solubility in DMF, and thus the high-power sonication step is important for mixing. The MPc MDE materials were separated by centrifuge and washed with DMF, ethanol and water (Milli-Q water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C was used throughout the experiments), followed by lyophilization to obtain the final products.\n\nSynthesis of P-NiNC\n\nThe synthesis adopted a previous report with minor modifications\n\n. Briefly, zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.9 g) and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (0.9 g) were dissolved in 120 ml methanol. The solution was then mixed with 2-methylimidazole (2.0 g dissolved in 40 ml methanol) and stirred at room temperature for 18 h. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 8,000 r.p.m. for 6 min to collect the precipitate, which was further washed with methanol three times and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The solid was subjected to heat treatment at 1,000 °C (at a ramping rate of 5 °C min\n−1\n) in a tube furnace for 3 h under 100 sccm argon flow. The black power was used directly without any further treatments."

Dashed lines show interpolated values.\nSource data\nFull size image\nThe product stream analyses of the ImF-Mo\n\nP and Mo\n\nP catalysts were conducted using gas chromatography (GC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to identify gas and liquid products. The FE measurements indicate that ImF-Mo\n\nP mainly produces C\n\nH\n\nin a potential range of −0.2 to −1.0 V \n) where the C\n\nH\n\nproduction starts at −0.2 V (this is equivalent to an overpotential of 340 mV considering C\n\nH\n\nthermodynamic potential of +0.14 V) with a\n\\(\\rm{FE}_{{\\rm{C}}_{3}}{_{\\rm{H}_8}}\\)\nof 38% and reaches a maximum value of 91% at −0.8 V (Supplementary \n). The FE results further reveal that C\n\nH\n\nselectivity slightly decreases (\n\\(\\rm{FE}_{{\\rm{C}}_{3}}{_{\\rm{H}_8}}\\)\nof 76% and 64% at −0.9 and −1.0 V, respectively) while H\n\nproduction increases at a potential range of −0.8 to −1.0 V suggesting that selectivity of ImF-Mo\n\nP is highly potential dependent\n\n,\n\n. In contrast, our measurements indicate that pristine Mo\n\nP nanoparticles are mainly selective for CO and methane (CH\n\n), with maximum FEs of 75% and 24% for CO and CH\n\nat −0.8 V, respectively, where only minor production of C\n\nH\n\nand C\n\nH\n\n(FE of less than 2%) was observed for this catalyst (Supplementary \n). Additionally, our C\n\nH\n\nproduction partial current density (\n\\(j_{{\\rm{C}}_{3}{\\rm{H}}_{8}}\\)\n) and energy efficiency calculations (\n\\(\\rm{EE}_{{\\rm{C}}_{3}}{_{\\rm{H}_8}}\\)\n) indicate maximum\n\\(j_{{\\rm{C}}_{3}{\\rm{H}}_{8}}\\)\nof −361 mA cm\n−\n\nand\n\\(\\rm{EE}_{{\\rm{C}}_{3}}{_{\\rm{H}_8}}\\)\nof 49% for ImF-Mo\n\nP at −0.8 V (Supplementary Notes\n\nand\n\n).\nTo validate and benchmark C\n\nH\n\nformation on the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalyst, we conducted\n\nC-labelled CO\n\n(\n\nCO\n\n) experiments at −0.8 V (Supplementary Note\n\n). The results illustrate that CO\n\nis the main source of the formed products, and C\n\nand C\n2+\nselectivity of the reaction is not due to a decomposition of carbon-containing molecules (for example, Im). To further verify stability of Im during the eCO\n\nRR, we have performed a long-term chronoamperometry experiment by purging ultra-high purity argon (Ar), instead of CO\n\n, to the electrolyser and run the reaction under identical experimental conditions without using the ionomer coating on the cathode electrode (Supplementary Note\n\n). The product stream analysis indicates that the Im remains fairly stable for about 30 h, and H\n\nis a single product of the reaction (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). However, a decomposition of the Im probably occurs after 30 h of the continuous process verified by GC and NMR experiments (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n).\nThen we employed the ionomer in the electrode fabrication of the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalyst and tested it in a long-run electrocatalytic process at the Ar environment (Supplementary Note\n\n). Our electrochemical experiments along with characterization results indicate that covering the surface of ImF-Mo\n\nP with the ionomer increases the stability of the electrode\n\nwhere H\n\nis the only product (Supplementary Note\n\n). We did not observe other gas or liquid products of the ionomer-coated ImF-Mo\n\nP electrode during a 100-hour continuous process (Supplementary \n).\nNext, using the ionomer-coated ImF-Mo\n\nP electrode, we have performed a long-term experiment and measured overall current density and FE over the course of the eCO\n\nRR \n). As shown in \n, the ionomer-coated ImF-Mo\n\nP electrode exhibits a stable current density of about −390 mA cm\n−\n\nat −0.8 V with\n\\(\\rm{FE}_{{\\rm{C}}_{3}}{_{\\rm{H}_8}}\\)\nof about 91 ± 2% during a 100 h continuous eCO\n\nRR process (at least three independent measurements were taken to determine the standard deviation represented by the error bars, which are displayed as the mean value ± its corresponding standard deviation). \nalso shows nearly 3% decay in the overall activity (current density) after 100 h. These results suggest that the presence of the ionomer stabilizes ImF-Mo\n\nP for the long-term eCO\n\nRR and prevents catalyst leaching that often occurs during long-term catalyst runs\n\n,\n\n.\nTo rule out the effect of roughness and evaluate the intrinsic activities of the ImF-Mo\n\nP and Mo\n\nP catalysts, we calculated turnover frequencies of C\n\nH\n\nproduction (\n\\(\\rm{TOF}_{{\\rm{C}}_{3}}{_{\\rm{H}_8}}\\)\n) by normalizing their activities to the number of Mo atoms at the surface using the roughness factor method (Supplementary Note\n\n)\n\n. The results shown in Supplementary \nindicate a maximum\n\\(\\rm{TOF}_{{\\rm{C}}_{3}}{_{\\rm{H}_8}}\\)\nof 1.9 s\n−1\nper site at −0.8 V for ImF-Mo\n\nP, which is about 66 times higher than that of pristine Mo\n\nP nanoparticles (0.03 s\n−1\nper site). Furthermore, Tafel plot analysis were conducted using the potentials and partial current densities to gain better understanding about the kinetics of the studied catalysts (Supplementary Note\n\n)\n\n. Our study shown in Supplementary \nindicates a steeper C\n\nH\n\nTafel slope for ImF-Mo\n\nP compared with pristine Mo\n\nP, suggesting different C\n\nH\n\nformation reaction pathways for the ImF-Mo\n\nP and Mo\n\nP catalysts. Moreover, we calculated a C\n\nH\n\nformation exchange current density (\n\\({i}_{o,{\\rm{C}}_3{\\rm{H}}_8}\\)\n) of 630 µA and 3 × 10\n−4\nµA for ImF-Mo\n\nP and pristine Mo\n\nP, respectively (Supplementary \n). This result clearly shows the superior intrinsic activity of ImF-Mo\n\nP compared to Mo\n\nP nanoparticles for C\n\nH\n\nproduction.\nSurface characterization and mechanistic understanding\nTo illuminate the origin of the observed electrocatalytic performance, we further studied the surface electronic and structural properties of ImF-Mo\n\nP by employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Supplementary Notes\n\n–\n\n), energy-loss near-edge structure (ELNES) and work function measurements (Supplementary Notes\n\nand\n\n).\nWe quantitatively compared various adsorption configurations of Im on the Mo\n\nP surface using DFT calculations. Within the bulk stability range of phosphorus chemical potential (∆\nµ\nP\n) for Mo\n\nP, the –[Mo\n\nP]\n0.5\nbulk-like terminated facet is determined to be the most stable surface for Mo\n\nP nanoparticles, according to surface energy calculations of hundreds of reconstructed surfaces obtained from our ab initio Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo (ai-GCMC) simulations\n\n(Supplementary Notes\n\n–\n\n). Then the atomic configuration for the ground-state *Im (N-bonded) adsorbate is shown in \n, together with the electronic transfer shown by the electron density difference map. Electrons accumulate between the overlapped orbitals of Mo and N, which indicates that there is a new Mo–N chemical bond formation at the interface of ImF-Mo\n\nP (additional projected density of states (PDOS) analysis in Supplementary \n).\n\nP catalysts.\na\n, Electron difference density maps for Im chemisorption onto the Mo\n\nP -[Mo\n\nP]\n0.5\nterminated surface, where regions of electron increase are in magenta, and electron losses upon Im adsorption are in cyan.\nb\n, ELNES of Mo-M\n\nedge for ImF-Mo\n\nP and bare Mo\n\nP.\nc\n, EIS experiments of the ImF-Mo\n\nP and Mo\n\nP catalysts. The experiments were conducted at a potential of −0.4 V.\nZ\nim\nand\nZ\nreal\nshow imaginary and real parts of impedance, respectively.\nd\n, In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy analyses of the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalyst in the eCO\n\nRR at OCP and\nE\nWE\nof −0.8 V.\nSource data\nFull size image\nNext, a combination of thermodynamic coverage calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics stability examinations show that the most favourable ImF-Mo\n\nP interface is with three Im adsorbed (with N-bonded, C–N-bonded and perpendicular geometries) per (9.63 × 13.85 Å\n\n) supercell surface area of our Mo\n\nP slab model (Supplementary Note\n\n). Moreover, because Mo sites exist on most of the exposed Mo\n\nP surfaces (Mo\n\nP is the most Mo-rich molybdenum phosphide in nature), this DFT-defined ImF-Mo\n\nP interface based on Mo–N bond connection can be extended to other experimentally observed Mo\n\nP surface reconstructions. Finally, the DFT-determined ImF-Mo\n\nP shows a 0.8 nm thickness of Im monolayer coated on the Mo\n\nP surface, which is close to our experimental measurements (≈1 nm) \nand Supplementary \n).\nThe electronic properties of surface atoms were analysed by ELNES. \nrepresents ELNES of Mo-M\n\nedge from the ImF-Mo\n\nP surface and pristine Mo\n\nP (Supplementary Note\n\n). The Mo-M\n\nedge white line indicates electronic transition from 3\np\n3/2\nto 3\ns\n,\nd\norbitals. As shown in \n, a slight shift (0.7 eV) of the ImF-Mo\n\nP surface spectrum compared with pristine Mo\n\nP and an increase of white-line intensity can be observed, suggesting that the Mo atoms of the ImF-Mo\n\nP surface have higher potential electrochemical activity than Mo atoms in the Mo\n\nP nanoparticles. Moreover, the PDOS results (Supplementary \n) show that more electronic states of Mo\nd\norbitals are near the Fermi energy when Im coats the Mo\n\nP surfaces. As a result, the Mo\nd\nband centre in ImF-Mo\n\nP (−0.39 eV) is higher than that of pristine Mo\n\nP (−0.77 eV), which indicates that Mo sites in ImF-Mo\n\nP are more promising towards CO\n\n/CO adsorption.\nUltraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was also used to compare the surface work function of the studied catalysts (Supplementary \n). The results indicate a lower work function for ImF-Mo\n\nP (3.31 eV) compared to pristine Mo\n\nP (3.45 eV), in agreement with our PDOS results of ImF-Mo\n\nP and pristine Mo\n\nP (Supplementary \n). To further analyse the charge-transfer properties of the studied catalysts in the double-layer region, similar to our previous studies\n\n,\n\n, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments at a potential of −0.4 V under identical experimental conditions (Supplementary Note\n\n). \nshows the fitted EIS spectra of the ImF-Mo\n\nP and Mo\n\nP catalysts using a Randles circuit model, indicating a smaller charge-transfer resistance (\nR\nct\n) for ImF-Mo\n\nP (~6 Ω) compared with pristine Mo\n\nP (~10 Ω) (\n). The lower work function and charge-transfer resistance obtained by UPS and EIS experiments, respectively, along with ELNES analyses suggest that functionalizing Mo\n\nP with Im promotes the electronic properties of Mo atoms at the surface of ImF-Mo\n\nP, resulting in a higher electrocatalytic activity of ImF-Mo\n\nP compared to pristine Mo\n\nP nanoparticles.\nAs in our previous study\n\n, the in situ Raman spectroscopy was conducted while performing the eCO\n\nRR to elucidate the higher C\n\nH\n\nselectivity of the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalyst compared with pristine Mo\n\nP (Supplementary Note\n\n). ,e\nand Supplementary \nindicate the in situ Raman spectra of the catalysts in a CO\n\n-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte at open circuit potential (OCP) and a working electrode cathodic potential (\nE\nWE\n) of −0.8 V. The results show four distinct Raman peaks at 275, 334, 1,063 and 2,294 cm\n−1\nwith the 1,063 cm\n−1\npeak corresponding to the adsorbed carbonate (CO\n\n2−\n) species at −0.8 V (refs.\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). However, at this potential, three newly observed Raman peaks at 275, 334 and 2,294 cm\n−1\ncorrespond to frustrated rotation of adsorbed *CO intermediates (P1), Mo–CO stretching (P2) and *C–O stretching (P3), respectively.\nOur peak intensity analysis indicates that P2/P1 ratio for ImF-Mo\n\nP (P2/P1\n≅\n1.8) is approximately nine times higher than that of Mo\n\nP catalyst (P2/P1\n≅\n0.2) at −0.8 V that can be an indication of stabilized *CO intermediates on the ImF-Mo\n\nP surface, leading to enhanced C–C–C trimerization\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Furthermore, the observed P3 peak (*C–O stretching) at −0.8 V with relatively higher intensity for ImF-Mo\n\nP compared with pristine Mo\n\nP (Supplementary \n) indicates a greater concentration/coverage of adsorbed *CO intermediates on the surface, which can be another reason for the increased *CO trimerization and consequently higher production rate of C\n\nH\n\nin the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalytic system\n\n.\nTo study why this catalytic system is mainly selective for hydrocarbons and not oxygenate products, due to their intertwined pathways, we also performed carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) experiments by using CO as the reactant to ensure a fully CO-covered surface (Supplementary Note\n\n). The selectivity analysis of ImF-Mo\n\nP shown in Supplementary \nindicates that this catalytic system is mainly selective for C\n\nH\n\n, C\n\nH\n\nand CH\n\nwith an overall FE of about 80% at a cathodic potential of −0.5 V, where trace amounts of alcohols (less than 2%) were observed at this potential (Supplementary Note\n\n). The CORR results suggest that with a fully CO-covered surface, this catalytic system is mainly selective for production of hydrocarbons, with C\n\nH\n\nas the dominant product (Supplementary Note\n\n).\nNext we investigated the active sites for CO\n\nadsorption on the ImF-Mo\n\nP surface using DFT calculations to gain more insight into the mechanism of the eCO\n\nRR. –c\nshows the configurations and standard Gibbs free energies (∆\nG\n°) for CO\n\nadsorption on the three active sites: C site between two N atoms of Im, bare Mo sites and bare P sites on the −[Mo\n\nP]\n0.5\n-terminated Mo\n\nP surface, respectively, that were identified to be the promising sites\n\n,\n\n. The calculations indicate that the bare Mo atoms on the ImF-Mo\n\nP surface are the most desired sites \n, ∆\nG\n° = −1.22 eV), where the C atom locates atop the Mo site and the O atoms locate on the bridge sites between two adjacent Mo sites (\nd\nMo–Mo\n= 2.8 Å).\n\n, Three possible active sites for CO\n\nadsorption on the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalysts, associated with the standard adsorption Gibbs free energies (∆\nG\n° =\nG\n\n*CO2\n–\nG\n\n* –\nG\n\nCO2\n, where * indicates the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalyst).

However, our DFT-derived Bader charge (\nq\n) shows that once the Im cation is adsorbed on the Mo\n\nP catalysts, all H atoms are covalently bonded to C in Im and are not easily deprotonated (Supplementary Note\n\n), unlike the electronic distribution of Im in the bulk ionic liquid (Supplementary Note\n\n). Therefore, we found it is energetically unfavourable (∆\nG\n° = 1.29 eV) to form Im-CO\n\nas a molecular adsorbate on the ImF-Mo\n\nP surface \n). Instead, the computed ∆\nG\n° values with and without Im ,d\n, respectively) indicate that Im acts as a ligand to stabilize the *CO\n\nadsorption by −0.26 eV on the Mo sites at the Mo\n\nP surface with a fairly small activation barrier of 0.22 eV (Supplementary \nand Supplementary Note\n\n).\nThe *Im-promoted CO\n\nadsorption process is found to benefit from Im acting as a cation bonded to the surface (\nq\nIm-per-molecule\n= 0.8\ne\n). This ligand can provide an electric field that electrostatically stabilizes the CO\n\nanion once adsorbed (\nq\nO-in-CO2\n= −1.6\ne\n), which additionally forms multiple hydrogen bonds between *Im and *CO\n\n(the closest O–H distance between *Im and *CO\n\nis 1.81 Å) in agreement with the assumptions in other studies\n\n,\n\n. In addition, the activation barrier of CO desorption is found to be 1.89 eV on the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalyst (Supplementary \n), which is much larger than that of pristine Mo\n\nP (1.1 eV) and most classical catalysts for the eCO\n\nRR (in a range of 0.7–1.1 eV, for example, Cu)\n\n,\n\n. Therefore, from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, the *CO intermediate will be more favourable to remain on the surface, leading to the formation of multi-carbon products on the ImF-Mo\n\nP surface (Supplementary Note\n\n). This supports our in situ Raman spectroscopy analyses \n) indicating that the stabilized *CO intermediates along with a high concentration/coverage of adsorbed *CO intermediates on the surface of ImF-Mo\n\nP result in a higher *CO trimerization and C\n\nH\n\nproduction for this catalyst\n\n. In addition, the above findings of active sites and the Im co-catalyst role (towards eCO\n\nRR) are also observed on another less thermodynamically favourable surface (Supplementary Note\n\n).\nEquipped with the active-site determination towards CO\n\nadsorption on the surface of the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalyst, we then studied the reaction pathways of the eCO\n\nRR from CO\n\nadsorbates to the C\n\nH\n\nproduct. To achieve this, we first determined that CO\n\nadsorption becomes more thermodynamically favourable than the competitive reaction of OH\n−\nadsorption at −0.22 V versus RHE (OH\n−\ncoming from 1 M KOH, thus affected by both pH and voltage) (Supplementary Note\n\n). Once CO\n\nadsorption becomes the dominant reaction on the Mo sites of ImF-Mo\n\nP, the eCO\n\nRR proceeds via multi-step protonation and electron transfer reactions (adding H\n+\n/e\n−\nto C and O atoms in the C-based intermediates; Supplementary Note\n\n).\n\nshows the most thermodynamically favourable reaction pathway from *CO\n\nadsorbate (reaction coordinate, RC1) to C\n\nH\n\n(RC17) on the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalyst, together with the DFT-derived Gibbs free energies (∆\nG\n) of all steps, summarized in Supplementary \n. The overall potential-determining step during the eCO\n\nRR is the initial proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step for *CO\n\nadsorbate to form *COOH, requiring −0.25 V versus RHE to make it thermodynamically favourable.\nThe initial PCET step for CO\n\n(or CO) adsorbate has also been reported to be the potential-determining step on other catalysts\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, including the classic Cu-based catalysts\n\n,\n\nand transition-metal phosphides from our previous study\n\n. Considering this thermodynamic-determined applied potential (−0.25 V) contribution, all the ensuing steps, consisting of adding H via H\n\nO dissociation reactions and adding CO\n\nto form C–C and C–C–C intermediates, are downhill (∆\nG\n< 0). In the most thermodynamically favourable mechanism \n), the initial steps (before RC7) consist of three sequential *CO\n\nadsorptions and related PCET reactions (*CO\n\n→ *COOH → *CO), thus forming *CO + *CO + *CO adsorbates (RC7) on three neighbouring Mo sites on ImF-Mo\n\nP. As for the next step of PCET for the middle *CO adsorbate to form RC8, the *CHO formation is found more thermodynamically favourable than the formation of *COH, in agreement with other studies (Supplementary Note\n\n)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. With these findings, the *CO + *CH + *CO (RC10) is found to be the most promising precursor to proceed into the trimerization step with ∆\nG\n= −0.65 eV, while trimerization of all RC7–RC9 states is thermodynamically unfavourable (cyan blue lines in Supplementary \n).\nThe structural evolution and free-energy profile (including activation barrier) for the trimerization step from *CO + *CH + *CO (RC10) to *CO–CH–CO (RC11) are shown in Supplementary \n, where the transition states for the C–C coupling steps are found to be 0.34 eV higher in energy than RC10, estimated by climbing-image-nudged elastic band method without temperature effects. Such a small energy requirement for C–C coupling can be easily achieved at room temperature\n\nand promoted by the next rapid hydrogenation step to form multi-carbon products compared to other reported catalysts in eCO\n\nRR\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n.\nAfter this key *C–C–C trimer is produced on the surface, the pathway to form the ultimate C\n\nH\n\nproducts becomes unique and straightforward, involving protonating all the O/OH groups in the adsorbates (starting from RC11) into H\n\nO and saturating C with H atoms to form RC15. In addition, we also examined the ultimate product selectivity of gaseous hydrocarbons versus liquid oxygenates. Comparing the different PCET routes for the *CHOH group in RC14, we found that the energy barrier to protonate C, and therefore desorbing −CH\n\nOH from the surface, is fairly larger (by 0.46 eV) than protonating the OH group that keeps *CH on the surface, because the former step requires additional energy to break the Mo–C bond (Supplementary Note\n\n). Therefore, we believe that *CHOH groups in RC14 prefer to be reduced to *CH in RC15, followed by further PCET steps to form the ultimate C\n\nH\n\nproduct as we provided in the mechanistic \n. This is consistent with our CORR experiments where we observed only hydrocarbons to be possible products for this catalyst (Supplementary Note\n\n). In addition, C\n\nand C\n\nproducts are difficult to form due to the surface structural limits, because the next active and bare Mo sites are at least 3 Å away from the Mo sites occupied by the *C–C–C trimer, which is too far to combine more C–C bonds (1.5 Å) (side/top view of trimer in Supplementary \n).\nConclusions\nIn summary, our study highlights the potential of the ImF-Mo\n\nP catalyst coated by the anion-exchange ionomer for efficient and selective electrocatalytic conversion of CO\n\ninto C\n\nH\n\n. The functionalization of Mo\n\nP nanoparticles with Im leads to a remarkable improvement in the electrocatalytic properties of the Mo atoms by fine tuning the electronic properties and electric field characteristics on the catalyst surface. This modification increases the formation of stable aggregations of multi-site *CO\n\n/*CO-related intermediates on the Mo sites, thereby facilitating the desired pathway for C\n\nH\n\nproduction as the final product.\n\nSynthesis of studied catalysts"

SiO gel (Davisil grade 62, pore size 150 Å, 60−200 mesh, part no. 243981, Sigma-\n\nAldrich) and acid purified SiO (SigmaAldrich, no. 84880) were used for catalyst\n\ncoimpregnation and catalyst dilution, respectively. For the IR and steady-state reactivity\nexperiments, the following gases were used: 10% H /Ar (±2%, Airgas), He (UHP, 99.999%,\n\nAirgas), 10% O /He (±2%, Airgas), and 10% CO/ He (±2%, Airgas) in an Al tank to prevent\n\nmetal carbonyls from entering reactant streams.\n\nCatalyst Preparation\nOur analysis focuses on catalysts synthesized using strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA)\nprinciples to deposit 0.025% wt. Pt on 5 nm diameter anatase TiO crystals, described\n\npreviously.1 This loading corresponds to ~0.4 Pt atoms/TiO particle, ensuring that Pt cluster (or\n\neven dimer) formation is minimized.\nIn a typical synthesis of 0.025 wt % Pt catalyst, 1 g of TiO was crushed, sieved to a powder\n\nfiner than 75 µm, and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight prior to synthesis. Twenty-five\nmilliliters of deionized water was mixed with 75 mL of NH OH to suspend the TiO support,\n4 2\nresulting in a solution pH of 12.2. Separately, 10 mg of TAPN was dissolved in 5 mL of\ndeionized water from which 300 µL were taken and added to 25 mL of NH OH to create a\n\nprecursor solution with a pH of 12.2. The 25 mL TAPN solution was injected over 12.5 hours\ninto the support solution while constantly stirring to achieve a final total solution volume of 125\nmL with a surface loading of 2900 m2/L.

A series of Pt/TiO catalysts with a target weight loading of\n\n0.75% were identically prepared and then pH adjusted. For each catalyst, 1.71 mg of TAPN\n(corresponding to a final concentration of 25 ppm) was added to 6 mL of water. Separately, 100\nmg of anatase TiO was dispersed in approximately 24 mL of water with microliter additions of\n\nacid or base to achieve the targeted pH under continuous stirring. The precursor solutions and\ncorresponding support solutions were separately and continuously stirred overnight. To\ncompensate for buffering effects, just prior to mixing, the pH of each support solution was\nchecked and adjusted as necessary (no pH adjustment was found necessary for the precursor\nsolutions). After combining a precursor-support solution pair, the final solution was allowed to\nmix for 1 hour. The final solution was then vacuum filtered using a 0.45 µm mixed cellulose\nester membrane filter (Grainger, 14A842), and the filtrate was collected for analysis of the Pt\nconcentration using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The\ndifference between the theoretical maximum Pt concentration, and the concentration of Pt\ncollected in the filtrate must equal the amount of Pt taken up by the support. Thus, the\nconcentration of the filtrate provides a direct means of measuring the Pt uptake. A 1000 ppm Pt\nstandard (Sigma-Aldrich, 19078) was purchased and a calibration standard series of five Pt\nconcentrations was prepared ranging from 0 to 200 ppm for ICP-OES spanning across the\nmaximum Pt concentration of 25 ppm.

A probable sequence\n\nexperimental evidence, the Pt single atoms and the anatase TiO\n\nsupport were stable, and no obvious irradiation damage was found.\nFor the in-situ STEM experiment, the electron beam was turned off except during image\ncollection. Moreover, additional experiments were carried out to compare images of the same\narea before and after an exposure to electron beam during image acquisition. Here, is an\nimage taken after the 30-min reducing treatment under 250 ˚C, showing the position of a Pt\nsingle atom on the TiO support, as indicated by the yellow circle. Then, one more image was\n\ntaken at the time of 31 min during this process, using the same imaging condition, as shown in\n. Apparently, no obvious motion of this Pt atom was observed according to the\ncomparison between Figs. S9a and S9b, confirming that the beam condition we used did not\nintroduce the movement of Pt single atoms on the TiO surface. Furthermore, shows an\n\nimage of the same area after an additional 30-min harsh reducing treatment under 450 ˚C, during\nwhich the electron beam was turned off. Clearly, the reducing treatment at a higher temperature\ncaused motion of this Pt single atom. However, the Pt single atom remained stable in the next\nimage (see ) taken at the time of 31 min of the harsh reducing treatment, demonstrating\nthat electron beam irradiation (under our imaging condition) did not trigger the motion of Pt\nsingle atoms. Therefore, these results rule out the possible artifact from the electron beam effect,\nand the observed Pt atom motion in our in-situ experiment was indeed caused by the harsh\nreducing treatment.\nX-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Characterization\nXANES spectra were calculated using FEFF9.9.127 on geometry-optimized Pt models from DFT\ncalculations. Self-consistent field radii of around 3.5 Å, corresponding to 2 coordination shells\nand full multiple-scattering radii of around 9.5 Å were used with the final-state core-hole rule for\nthe absorber. The COREHOLE NONE card was used.\nThe stoichiometry of the atoms, which is critical for calculating the Fermi energy, was set to\naccount for a Pt:TiO ratio of 1:9000 as expected in 0.025 wt.% Pt/TiO . The atoms of the\n2 2\nligands and support in the vicinity of the Pt absorber (C and O of carbonyl group, O’s at distinct\nlocations within ca. 2.3 Å of Pt) were assigned individual potentials and their stoichiometry\nadapted to that of the absorber. Ti and O further away from the absorber were assigned the 1:2\nstoichiometry of TiO and non-absorber Pt the lowest stoichiometry possible (0.001) to make\n\ntheir contribution negligible. Pt L -edge XANES spectra were calculated for all DFT-optimized\n\nPt/TiO configurations described above and shown in \n2 ads 2\nexcellent agreement to observed characteristics for mildly reduced Pt /TiO . Agreement was\niso 2\nfound between vibrational frequencies (2121 cm-1 calculated, 2112 cm-1 experimentally\nobserved), adsorption energy of CO (103 kJ/mol calculated, 84 kJ/mol measured), and structural\nfeatures (Pt being in line with Ti cation columns when observed along the axis, ,\nand local coordination derived from EXAFS, Tables S1, S2). Good agreement was also found for\ncalculated characteristics of (PtO ) at the TiO step site and experimental results,\n2 ads 2\nalthough with a weaker CO adsorption energy of 50 kJ/mol. As calculated CO binding energies\nare systematically overestimated, this structure agrees less well with the experiments than the\n(PtO ) on terrace sites, however, from the EXAFS fits, the coordination numbers for Pt-O and\n2 ads\nPt-Ti seem to match better for the step site than the terrace.\n\nexperimental Pt-O bond distance\nof 1.99 Å matches the step site model (1.97-2.04 Å Pt-O bond distances) better than the terrace\nsite model (2.02-2.08 Å Pt-O bond distances). We hypothesized based on these analyses that the\nPt atom sits primarily at TiO step sites following oxidation and mild reduction pre-treatments.\n\nDetermining the location of Pt atom following harsh reduction began with the (PtO ) complex\n2 ads\nas a starting point, as this structure was found to accurately represent the catalyst after mild\nreduction. The most stable structures identified following hydrogenation were a PtOH species,\n(PtOH) , and a Pt(OH) species, [Pt(OH) ] , although alternative possibilities were also\nads 2 2 ads\ninvestigated. Each stable structure was considered on both terrace and stepped \nanatase TiO sites, -16. Of the stable structures identified, the (PtOH) species, ads\nS13, S15, are most likely. Due to the breaking of a Pt-O bond from (PtO ) , this species is\n2 ads\nexpected to be less strongly coordinated to the support and more mobile, consistent with the in-\nsitu microscopy. The calculated CO binding strength to the (PtOH) complex is 184 kJ/mol\n\nexperimentally measured band positions following harsh reduction of 2077 cm-1 and\n2050 cm-1 for terrace and step sites respectively.\nFrom these analyses, the 6-fold coordinated Pt after oxidative pre-treatment, (PtO ) after\nsubTi 2 ads\nmild reduction and (PtOH) ( and S15) after harsh reduction are the model structures\n\nexperimental measurements. Comparison of the experimental XANES\nspectra to the fits of these DFT-proposed structures for both terraces () and steps () showed the best agreement compared to the other structures.

Pt on 5 nm diameter anatase TiO crystals, described\n\npreviously.1 This loading corresponds to ~0.4 Pt atoms/TiO particle, ensuring that Pt cluster (or\n\neven dimer) formation is minimized.\nIn a typical synthesis of 0.025 wt % Pt catalyst, 1 g of TiO was crushed, sieved to a powder\n\nfiner than 75 µm, and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight prior to synthesis. Twenty-five\nmilliliters of deionized water was mixed with 75 mL of NH OH to suspend the TiO support,\n4 2\nresulting in a solution pH of 12.2. Separately, 10 mg of TAPN was dissolved in 5 mL of\ndeionized water from which 300 µL were taken and added to 25 mL of NH OH to create a\n\nprecursor solution with a pH of 12.2. The 25 mL TAPN solution was injected over 12.5 hours\ninto the support solution while constantly stirring to achieve a final total solution volume of 125\nmL with a surface loading of 2900 m2/L. Following the slow precursor addition, the final\nsolution was heated to 70 °C until completely dried.\nThe catalyst was calcined in a tube furnace at 450 °C for 4 hours in flowing air after ramping up\nto temperature at a rate of 10 °C/min. The high temperature and extended duration of the\ncalcination ensured removal of all remaining amine or nitrate ligands from the TAPN precursor,\nwhich are completely decomposed under these conditions. To ensure consistency, results were\nverified across synthesis batches, and the same batch of catalyst exhibited consistent behavior\nover the course of months.\nICP-OES\nICP-OES measurements were performed to quantitatively determine the accuracy of the SEA\nmodel at predicting metal uptake.

Ce\n3+\npresents a magnetic moment of ~1\nμ\n\npreparation route from the metal nanoparticles that results in PtO\n\nvolatilization and deposition). Under mild, reducing conditions and medium to high temperatures, like the pulses employed in catalytic activation, both H\n\nand CO can open up Pt–4O \n(cycle 1) and Supplementary \n). In \n, molecular hydrogen has to overcome a relatively large activation barrier\n\n(1.35 eV) to split over Pt and O (−0.67 eV below reactants). Next, the hydrogen and hydroxyl group recombine to form a water molecule, which readily leaves the surface. H\n\ndissociates over the regular O-termination pristine CeO\n\nvia a transition state at 0.82 eV, with the final state lying −3.00 eV below gas-phase reactants (see \n). Alternatively, if Pt–4O is reduced by CO, the molecule adsorbs onto a lattice oxygen of this unit and evolves towards CO\n\n. The highest activation barrier in this path is ~1 eV and the final state is −1.23 eV below reactants. Therefore, the relative inertness of Pt SACs against H\n\n, and the low CO uptake in the temperature programmed desorption experiments, are related to the low pressures employed in ultra-high vacuum experiments\n\n,\n\n. The activation process, as described here, is reversible in an oxidizing environment. A deactivation switch is what sets this system apart from other catalysts, such as nanoclusters, which can be prepared using oxidizing airflow\n\n.

This newly gained degree of freedom, introduced by the presence of the reducible support, might break linear scaling relationships and thus open the path to more active and selective catalysts.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41563-019-0444-y\nSource: main text file\n\nSynthesis procedures can target different nanostructures with variable ratios of exposed , and surfaces\n,\n\n.

The catalytic activity is believed to be related to well-dispersed single atoms or low-nuclearity clusters. We have gathered the following observations from the literature on this material: Pt disperses or agglomerates as a function of the environment\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n; isolated Pt atoms, as prepared, have been proposed and discarded as potential catalytic centres\n\n,\n\n; short-pulse treatments are needed to render the Pt catalyst active\n\n; and the nature of the active site remains unknown.\nCeria presents low-energy electron transport mediated by polarons\n\n,\n\n. Therefore, the properties at the metal/ceria interface might depart from the static interpretations due to electron dynamics. In the present work, we have performed extensive first-principles molecular dynamics to unravel the role of charge transfer at the interface. We identify several metal oxidation and charge states, reachable at moderate temperatures, and show how they impact the reactivity and, in particular, how they meet the requirements for low-temperature (<150 °C) oxidation.\nThe three lowest-energy surface facets of ceria are , and the polar . Platinum adsorption was tested on all of them using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional together with the Hubbard\nU\ncorrection, PBE+U (Supplementary \n). Our results agree with previous findings\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. The and surfaces cannot stabilize single-atom Pt, thus metal nanoparticles form instead. Only the surface can stabilize isolated Pt. Therefore, we focus on these slabs as models for local, nanostructured regions (for example, step or edge sites)\n\n. The low coordination of the surface oxygen atoms on the oxygen-terminated version increases their mobility\n\n. As such, restructures into various coexisting patterns at elevated temperatures encountered during pretreatment. Due to this collection of oxygen distributions, Pt adsorbs on the surface surrounded by a variable number of oxygen ligands (\nn\n) in the first coordination sphere, denoted as Pt–\nn\nO (\nn\n= 2, 3 or 4) –d\n).\n\n.\na\n, Adsorption energy (\nE\nads\n) of Pt on CeO\n\n, for the different oxidation states (mOSs) on the surfaces, with distributions stemming from the surface oxygen mobility\n\n.\nE\nads\n(left\ny\naxis) is with respect to the resting 2O surface, while Δ\nE\n(right\ny\naxis) is with respect to the most stable Pt–\nn\nO configuration.\nb\n–\nd\n, Three Pt coordination environments (Pt–\nn\nO, where\nn\nis two (\nb\n), three (\nc\n) or four (\nd\n) O atoms acting as ligands) appear, where O, Ce and Pt are red, yellow and green, respectively. In\na\n, mOSs are assigned employing Ce magnetization as a proxy\n\n. Each energy level corresponds to a local minima with a fixed Ce\n3+\nlocalization (see Supplementary \nfor examples). Pt–4O only resides in the Pt\n2+\nstate. The horizontal lines present the thermodynamic stability with respect to the Pt bulk and 2-nm-diameter nanoparticle (Supplementary \n). Benchmarks with different\nU\nvalues and HSE and RPA functionals are presented in Supplementary \nand Supplementary Tables\n\n–\n\n, and discussed in the Methods.\nFull size image\nWhen the Pt atom is charged, it transfers one or more electrons to the surface, which can localize on any cerium atom. All possible electronic and coordination configurations were sampled via geometry relaxation and we retained only the stable local minima. Their adsorption energies are shown in \n, grouped by coordination (Pt–\nn\nO) and oxidation state (Pt\n\n, Pt\n+\nor Pt\n2+\n). To properly assign the nature of the adsorbed atom, we initially employed Bader charges, but they are a poor descriptor of oxidation states\n\n. The Pt magnetic moment (Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary \n) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) features (Supplementary \n) also depend on the oxidation state. The latter can be mapped to the experimental XPS spectrum\n\n. The spectral shift from Pt\n\nto Pt\n2+\nmatches the experimental one\n\n. Note that the peak in between is assigned there to an intermediate species, which we identify as Pt\n+\n. However, the inhomogeneities and final state effects can make assignment difficult. Instead, for a most robust fingerprint identification, and considering that single-atom Pt is the sole possible source of electrons in these models, we can count the number of Ce\n3+\n. This corresponds to the number of electrons lost by the metal atom. Ce\n3+\npresents a magnetic moment of ~1\nμ\nB\non the 4\nf\norbitals (compared with 0\nμ\nB\nof Ce\n4+\n), which has already been employed in the literature\n\n. Therefore, this descriptor is used to trace the metal oxidation state (mOS) of the Pt atom.\nThe Pt–4O structure encompasses the lowest energy states of all geometric and electronic configurations. Its mOS is always confined to Pt\n2+\n, with two surface Ce\n4+\nreduced. This behaviour coincides with the coordination rules in coordination chemistry\n\n. The multiple Ce\n3+\nconfigurations show a very fine energy distribution, with spacings of just a few meV (Supplementary \n). Moreover, this structure is thermodynamically favourable compared with the cohesive energy of bulk Pt (horizontal orange line), thus the SAC is stable against agglomeration\n\n. This explains why Pt–4O species can be generated from the regular ceria 2O trenches that incorporate volatile PtO\n\nspecies\n\n, making for excellent precursors to the SAC.\nPt–2O is next in energy, with Pt\n+\nbeing the most stable mOS within the potential energy manifold associated with this geometry. Yet, all of these structures are only stable compared with the cohesive energy of a 2-nm-diameter Pt nanoparticle (Supplementary \n). This means that isolated atoms are stable against the initial states of agglomeration, and even dimerization is unfavoured (Supplementary \n). Comparing all three mOSs on Pt–2O, the (near-)degeneracy of the electron distributions overlap irrespective of the functional employed (see Methods, Supplementary \nand Supplementary Tables\n\n–\n\n). Pt–3O exhibits even larger overlap, but the coordination as a whole is unstable with respect to agglomeration.\nThe reason different electronic configurations coexist can be traced back to the interplay between the ionization potentials of the isolated gas-phase Pt atoms, surface reduction and distortion, and changes in electrostatic interactions. This is shown in the Born–Haber cycle (Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary \n), which starts with an isolated Pt atom and the pristine CeO\n\n surface. When Pt adsorbs as Pt\n\non the regular 2O surface, the resulting covalent contribution is −1.93 eV, as calculated by the formation of two Pt–O bonds in Pt(H\n\nO)\n\n. In parallel, the gas-phase ionization of a Pt atom to Pt\n+\nrequires 8.96 eV\n\n. Assuming that the covalent contribution persists throughout the oxidation steps, the energy compensation needs to come either from the surface reduction\n\nand/or the changes in the electrostatic contributions. The Coulomb interaction\n\nbetween the Pt–O and Ce–O pairs stands out with a value of 9.73 eV. This term is calculated from the charges and the first neighbour distances of the Pt\n\n–2O and Pt\n+\n–2O (Supplementary \n). Adding up these contributions, the step from Pt\n\nto Pt\n+\non Pt–2O is slightly endothermic by 0.3 eV. Indeed, even this simple thermodynamic cycle highlights that the change in mOS is compensated for by the electrostatic contributions.\nTo verify whether the charge transfer processes presented above are kinetically attainable, first-principles Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) were performed on all three Pt–\nn\nO structures, following an approach similar to that described in \n\n, Supplementary \nand Supplementary Videos\n\n–\n\n). BOMD simulations are computationally very demanding; thus, the Pt–\nn\nO structures were simulated in (2 × 2) supercells. Before that, it was assessed that the patterns in \nare still properly represented in the smaller cell (Supplementary \n). Vice versa, a short heating simulation of Pt–2O in the (3 × 3) slabs also confirmed the polaron-induced charge transfer for larger supercells (Supplementary Video\n\n).\n\n–\nc\n, Time evolution at 600 K of the atom-resolved oxidation states of the Pt and surface Ce atoms, for Pt–2O (\na\n), Pt–3O (\nb\n) and Pt–4O (\nc\n).

The simulation exhibits an alternating number of Ce\n3+\ncentres, confirming the dynamic nature of the mOS directly. A visualization of the trajectory is shown in Supplementary Video\n\n, where the smooth nature of the electron transfer events can be observed. An individual transfer is captured in Supplementary \n, with the electron in\n\\({\\mathrm{Ce}}_{\\mathrm{C}}^{{\\mathrm{top}}}\\)\nmoving to\n\\({\\mathrm{Ce}}_{\\mathrm{A}}^{{\\mathrm{top}}}\\)\nby temporarily crossing over Pt. In the case of Pt–3O \n), the coordination shell starts opening at ~300 K during the heating process. On opening, the oxygen atoms adopt the regular row pattern of the Pt–2O configuration. This corroborates that Pt–3O is a metastable state, as found in \n. Remarkably, Pt–3O does not reconstruct to the global minimum, namely Pt–4O. Finally, the Pt–4O system \n) remains stable with respect to its coordination, and maintains the mOS in accordance with \nrepulsion.\nConsidering that Pt–3O transforms into the Pt–2O coordination, their data can be analysed together to illustrate the persistence of different oxidation and charge states. The frequency histogram in \npresents their lifetimes (that is, the time interval that Pt resides uninterruptedly in a single mOS (Supplementary Note\n\n)). Even though Pt\n\nand Pt\n+\ntake up almost equal portions of time (47 and 49%, respectively), Pt\n\ncan vastly outlive Pt\n+\n, with outliers of up to 5 and 12 ps. Therefore Pt\n+\n—the most stable state at 0 K—is no longer the longest-living species at 600 K.\nTo understand the origin of the Pt mOS dynamics on the CeO\n\n surface, the density of states (DOS) of the full Pt–2O system is decomposed into the metal and oxide units at the geometries of the different lowest-energy mOSs \n). The DOS diagram features the filled O(2\np\n) valence band (red) and the empty Ce(4\nf\n) levels (orange) placed in the band gap. \nshows the 2O-terminated CeO\n\n, while \ncorresponds to the isolated, gas-phase Pt atom in a\nd\n\ns\n\nelectronic configuration in a structure where Pt is far away from the surface. All systems are aligned according to the 2\ns\nband centre of the central oxygen atoms in the slab. As in the Born–Haber cycle, the isolated Pt atom is first allowed to interact with two water molecules, forming Pt–(H\n\nO)\n\nin \n. The Pt levels shift higher up to the Fermi level (green line) due to the covalent (antibonding) interaction. In the simulations for the Pt–2O system, we identified that the presence of Pt distorts the CeO\n\nsurface to different extents depending on the mOS. Therefore, the electronic structure of the oxide in the geometry corresponding to the lowest energy configuration of each Pt-2O mOS occupies the panels shown in –d. Surface distortions push the ligand O(2\np\n) levels up to higher energies. Concomitantly, the cation cavity increases, the repulsion with their O neighbours decreases, and the Ce(4\nf\n) states drop below the Fermi level of Pt–(H\n\nO)\n\n. This establishes the driving force for electron transfer from Pt to the oxide. Our results are robust compared with other functionals (Supplementary \nand Supplementary Note\n\n). Therefore, electron transfer at the Pt–\nn\nO interface can be understood as a phonon-assisted metal-support interaction that can appear when: the metal levels lie either in the band gap or closely above the Fermi level of the reducible semiconductor; the surface is flexible enough to allow surface distortions; and empty cation states appear in the band gap within an energy range accessible as a consequence of the geometric distortion. To assess the scope of phonon-assisted metal-support interaction, we performed a scan (similar to \n) for Ni on the same CeO\n\nsurface or for the same metal on a different oxide rutile TiO\n\n. Supplementary \nsuggests the coexistence of multiple oxidation states for these systems as well.\n\nsurface, showing the filled valence band (red) and empty Ce(4\nf\n) bands (orange).\nb\n–\nd\n, DOSs of 2O systems with oxide geometries of Pt\n\n–2O (\nb\n), Pt\n+\n–2O (\nc\n) and Pt\n2+\n–2O (\nd\n).

Each coordination is aligned with its respective DOS panels. Tests with different functionals show no significant changes (see Supplementary \n).\nFull size image\nThe variable coordination and oxidation states affect the reactivity \n). Pt\n2+\n–4O is the most robust state, in agreement with the ionic nature identified in experiments\n\n,\n\n, and breaking this coordination by removing an oxygen is very endothermic (~1.84 eV). Thus, Pt\n2+\n–4O is the resting state of the material under most conditions (in particular, under the oxidative preparation route from the metal nanoparticles that results in PtO\n\nvolatilization and deposition). Under mild, reducing conditions and medium to high temperatures, like the pulses employed in catalytic activation, both H\n\nand CO can open up Pt–4O \n(cycle 1) and Supplementary \n). In \n, molecular hydrogen has to overcome a relatively large activation barrier\n\n(1.35 eV) to split over Pt and O (−0.67 eV below reactants). Next, the hydrogen and hydroxyl group recombine to form a water molecule, which readily leaves the surface. H\n\ndissociates over the regular O-termination pristine CeO\n\nvia a transition state at 0.82 eV, with the final state lying −3.00 eV below gas-phase reactants (see \n). Alternatively, if Pt–4O is reduced by CO, the molecule adsorbs onto a lattice oxygen of this unit and evolves towards CO\n\n. The highest activation barrier in this path is ~1 eV and the final state is −1.23 eV below reactants. Therefore, the relative inertness of Pt SACs against H\n\n, and the low CO uptake in the temperature programmed desorption experiments, are related to the low pressures employed in ultra-high vacuum experiments\n\n,\n\n. The activation process, as described here, is reversible in an oxidizing environment. A deactivation switch is what sets this system apart from other catalysts, such as nanoclusters, which can be prepared using oxidizing airflow\n\n. After the CO or H\n\ntreatment, the Pt–4O coordination is reduced to Pt–3O.\n\n, Reaction energy cycles (in eV) for surface reduction (cycle 1; black by CO; blue by H\n\n) and CO oxidation (cycle 2), with red spheres denoting the Pt coordination.

The mOS lifetimes are presented in the inset, as retrieved from BOMD 10.5-ps trajectories of the reaction intermediates. In step II, Pt\n+\nand Pt\n2+\ncollapse to the same energy level. The inset supports this by showing that both mOSs coexist and are dynamically connected.\nc\n, Side (top) and top (bottom) views of the reaction steps. Dark red denotes oxygen from the bulk phase (s) and bright red denotes oxygen from the gas phase (g).\nFull size image\nThe Pt–3O system is labile with respect to oxygen diffusion, as shown by the molecular dynamics simulations, where it converts into Pt–2O in <0.5 ps at 300 K. Therefore, our results show that reducing atmospheres convert the resting Pt–4O state into Pt–2O species. This explains why recent experiments need short, reducing pulses at 250 °C to generate the active platinum species\n\nthat we can now identify as Pt–2O. The barriers of ~1 eV explain why temperatures of at least 250 °C are required during activation, while higher exposure times to reducing atmospheres induce Pt agglomeration. However, the transient nature of Pt–2O makes it difficult to characterize it experimentally, even under operando conditions. Note that even single atoms have only recently been clearly identified in microscopy\n\n.\nThe system then enters cycle 2 of ,b\n. Complementary data for the elementary steps, alternative routes and structures can be found in Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n. On Pt–2O state I in \n, the three mOSs coexist and have been investigated separately for CO reduction. Overall, CO adsorption is relatively weak, but the gas-phase CO pressures are large under low-temperature (<150 °C) conditions and ionic Pt has the largest adsorption energies. Indeed, charge dependence for CO adsorption on SACs was also reported for Pt\n\n/TiO\n\nanatase\n\n. The CO vibrational shift for this state is around 60 cm\n−1\n, similar to the experimental value reported (75 cm\n−1\n)\n\n(see Supplementary \n). The BOMD for this intermediate shows larger lifetimes for the ionic Pt configurations (with a 1:2 ratio between Pt\n+\nand Pt\n2+\n). Then, O\n\ncan adsorb, forming a percarbonate species with an O–O bond distance of 1.452 Å. In the BOMD, this state of the SAC corresponds to no electron transfer to the Ce\n4+\ncentres. However, in this particular coordination, the formal oxidation state of the metal is Pt\n2+\n, regardless of its previous state. Hence, the O\n\nadsorption energy depends on the electronic state of configuration (II), and can be as large as −1.20 eV. From this configuration on, CO\n\nformation easily pushes the system to the low-lying Pt\n\nstate. The barrier for this step is about 0.56 eV. To evolve to Pt\n+\n, the energy required is much larger (namely, 1.11 eV). Therefore, during the CO oxidation cycle in the Pt–2O structure, the electronic structure of the material needs to be dynamic to allow both the adsorption of CO (occurring at ionic states) and oxidation (occurring at the neutral state) elementary steps in the mechanism. Separate BOMD runs were also performed on the reaction intermediates, showing that some of them exhibit dynamic electron transfer (see insets in \nand Supplementary \n). We have added the weights (percentage of lifetimes) of the different mOSs in the band below each structure, indicating that for some intermediates (CO) dynamic electron transfer occurs, while with others (percarbonate) a single electronic configuration is more likely.\nRegarding the stability of Pt–2O (and Pt–4O), Pt diffusion is impeded by 2.9 eV. Dimerization on the trenches is also endothermic, regardless of mOS (see Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary \n). This reinforces the role of isolated Pt atoms in CO oxidation. If CO is adsorbed, the barriers slightly lower, but dimerization remains difficult in most cases. Volatilization of Pt as molecular PtO\n\nis also endothermic (by ~1 eV); thus, volatilization is negligible at the reaction temperatures employed in low-temperature CO oxidation, and only taking place in oxidizing conditions that lock Pt in the Pt–4O coordination.\nTherefore, the Pt/CeO\n\nbehaviour can be summarized as follows: Pt\n\n–2O is the longest-lasting state in the molecular dynamics simulations, but its ability to trap CO is low. In turn, the short lifetime of the Pt\n+\nspecies will impact the reactivity of the SAC. Addressing the microkinetics of the Pt/CeO\n\nsystem thus requires the use of accessible ensemble concepts\n\n. The overall CO oxidation reaction barrier is ~0.56 eV; this energy is compatible with the high activity observed at temperatures lower than the 150 °C requirement of the exhaust emission challenge.\nIn summary, the common assignment of a fixed oxidation state in single-atom catalysts is exceedingly simple. Depending on the metal/oxide combination, a dynamic charge transfer between the metal and the oxide appears instead. The electron transfer is assisted by phonons and stems from the level alignment between the metal and the defect states in the oxide. As a result, several oxidation and charge states might coexist, enriching the chemistry of single atoms on oxide surfaces. We demonstrated how the reactivity is closely related to the dynamic behaviour. Our results explain the latest experimental observations that indicate the need for short pulses to redisperse Pt nanoparticles in order to be activated as single atoms to perform low-temperature oxidations (in the 150 °C challenge). We identify how the metal/oxide dynamic charge transfer is crucial to understanding the nature of the active site and the mechanism in these SACs. This newly gained degree of freedom, introduced by the presence of the reducible support, might break linear scaling relationships and thus open the path to more active and selective catalysts.\n\nMethods\nSlab preparation"

From the comprehensive analysis with XPS, NEXAFS and FTIR, we can conclude that cobalt centres become relatively electron poor when near to C–O–C atomic structures and that these groups are thermodynamically stable at the mild reduction temperature of 500 °C, which is further supported by the DFT analysis (Supplementary \n). After reduction at 900 °C, most of the oxygen species, which including C–O–C groups, desorb \n)\n\n,\n\n. Utilizing the thermodynamics of different functional groups on GO, we could design the Co–N\n\nmoieties surrounded by oxygen species (C–O–C epoxides), which is an ideal system for highly active H\n\nO\n\nproduction, as predicted by the DFT calculations \n).\nORR kinetics can proceed via either a 2e\n−\nor a 4e\n−\npathway \n) and the selectivity is determined by the propensity to break the O–O bond during the ORR process. We can quantify the amount of H\n\nO\n\nformed using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) at 1,600 r.p.m. in an oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The ring electrode was held at 1.2 V to oxidize only the H\n\nO\n\nformed at disk electrode, which avoids other ORR currents at the ring electrode. The optimal catalyst loading amount was 10 μg cm\n−2\n(Supplementary \ngives details). The Co\n\n–NG(O) catalyst, which has an electron-poor cobalt centre induced by the surrounding oxygen species (for example, C–O–C epoxides), is able to catalyse the 2e\n−\nORR and shows a superior activity for H\n\nO\n\nproduction in comparison to state-of-the-art catalysts (Figs.\n3b\nand\n4a\n). The electronic structure of the Co–N\n\nsite is modified by nearby C–O–C epoxides such that it is difficult to break the O–O bond, which ensures a high selectivity to H\n\nO\n\n(~82%; \n). However, Co\n\n–NG(R), which is mainly composed of Co–N\n\nsites, predominantly produce water, which matches well with our DFT results \nand Supplementary \n). \nshows the ring current adjusted by collection efficiency (Supplementary \n) for H\n\nO\n\nproduction\n\\(\\left( {I_{{\\mathrm{H}}_2{\\mathrm{O}}_2}} \\right)\\)\nat 0.7 V.

Co\n\n–NG(O) shows an improvement in the onset potential and ORR kinetics with increasing cobalt amount, whereas Co\n\n-G(O), which is composed of cobalt metal centres without nitrogen atom bonding, shows hardly any change (Supplementary \n). This observation supports that the ORR performance is specifically associated with the Co–N\n\nmoieties and the optimal cobalt amount for H\n\nO\n\nproduction was 1.4 wt% (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n).

Without cobalt atoms, the NG(O) showed a poor activity, especially in an acidic medium, which is often seen in carbonaceous catalysts\n\n,\n\n(\nSupplementary Information\ngives details). However, our electron-poor cobalt metal centres serve as O\n\nadsorption sites on the graphitic carbon matrix, which facilitates the adsorption of O\n\nmolecules and effectively prevents the 2e\n−\n+ 2e\n−\nreaction mechanism (Supplementary \n). In addition, Co\n\n–NG(O) exhibited a significantly higher activity for H\n\nO\n\nproduction than NG(O), Fe\n\n–NG(O) and Ni\n\n–NG(O) (Supplementary \n), with an onset potential of ~0.8 V \n). It is slightly higher than the thermodynamic limit of 0.76 V (in 0.1 M KOH, pH = 13), which has been also observed in the previously reported electrocatalysts based on noble metal alloys and carbon-based materials\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. This can be attributed to a Nernst-related potential shift due to the low H\n\nO\n\nconcentration in electrolyte under highly alkaline media (\nSupplementary Information\ngives details). These results indicate that Co\n\n–NG(O) is highly active for H\n\nO\n\nproduction in a wide range of pH levels, but effectively prevents the consecutive reduction of H\n\nO\n\ninto H\n\nO.\nFor the comparison, the kinetic current density for H\n\nO\n\nproduction was derived by correcting for mass-transport limitations using the Koutecky–Levich equation (\n\nMethods\n). The calculated kinetic current density of Co\n\n–NG(O) for H\n\nO\n\nproduction was 2.8 ± 0.2 mA cm\n−2\n(at 0.65 V), which demonstrates its superior H\n\nO\n\nproduction activity that far surpasses that of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts \n)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n.

Furthermore, we compared the mass activities of the recently reported carbonaceous catalysts with that of Co\n\n–NG(O) in alkaline media at 0.75 V, much closer to the onset potential of the HO\n\n−\n/O\n\nprocess, as the polarization of Co\n\n–NG(O) can reach the mass-limiting current very quickly due to the electron-poor cobalt atoms that serve as O\n\nadsorption sites. Until now, a few-layered, mildly reduced GO (F-mrGO) exhibited the highest mass activity. Notably, Co\n\n–NG(O) exhibits a 3.5 times higher H\n\nO\n\nproduction activity \n) than that of F-mrGO. Furthermore, the turnover frequency value of Co\n\n–NG(O) was calculated to be 3.38 ±0.15 s\n−1\n(\nSupplementary Information\ngives details on the calculation), which is much higher than those of other catalysts (Supplementary \n).

Of the initial current density, 98.7% was retained after 110 h.\nFull size image\nTo evaluate the amount of H\n\nO\n\ngenerated in real devices, we prepared our catalyst on carbon paper (\n\nMethods\n) with a loading of 1 mg cm\n−2\nand tested it in a custom-made electrochemical H-type cell (Supplementary \n) modified from that reported previously\n\n,\n\n. In an alkaline electrolyte, we performed the electrochemical H\n\nO\n\nproduction of Co\n\n–NG(O) catalysts at 25 °C (Supplementary \ngives details on the effect of reaction temperature). Co\n\n–NG(O) showed a very high H\n\nO\n\nproductivity of 418 ±19 mmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n(at 50 mA; Supplementary \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), which is more than twice the amount of H\n\nO\n\nproduced by a Au–Pd catalyst in direct synthesis\n\n, which demonstrates the feasibility of electrochemical H\n\nO\n\nproduction. Our optimized Co\n\n–NG(O) catalyst could produce a H\n\nO\n\nconcentration of 5,812 ppm (suitable for applications that require diluted H\n\nO\n\nsolutions) after 24 hours using our custom-made H-type cell, which contains 10 ml of catholyte (Supplementary \n). Furthermore, the Co\n\n–NG(O) catalyst is stable throughout the entire pH level for a long-term production of H\n\nO\n\n, notably with a 98.7% activity retention over 110 hours at 0.65 V in alkaline conditions \n). This confirms that the highly active Co–N\n\n(O) moieties are very stable in either alkaline or acidic environments for the H\n\nO\n\nproduction (Supplementary \n). Under the harsh condition of a higher overpotential (at 0.55 V), Co\n\n–NG(O) still retains its excellent stability with little chemical and structural change (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). When the reaction temperature is raised, the overall ORR kinetics and the H\n\nO\n\nselectivity increase, whereas the produced H\n\nO\n\ndecomposes more rapidly (Supplementary \n). Cobalt is commonly known to be less reactive to Fenton reactions when compared to iron-based catalysts, which suffer from poor stability. Recently, cobalt and manganese SACs were reported as good alternatives to iron-based electrocatalysts to prevent the serious degradation by Fenton reactions\n\n,\n\n. Thus, the high stability in a wide pH range and the substantially enhanced H\n\nO\n\nproduction activity can be simultaneously achieved by our design strategy of electron-poor cobalt metal centres modulated by the surrounding atomic configuration. Co\n\n–NG(O) shows a H\n\nO\n\nproduction activity comparable to the previously reported platinum SACs in acidic media (\nSupplementary Information\nand Supplementary \ngive details).\nThrough experiments and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the surrounding atomic configuration of SACs mediates the H\n\nO\n\nproduction activity of metal centres. Owing to the diverse synthetic methods of Co–N\n\nstructures, there has been a debate on the reaction mechanism for ORR (a 2e\n−\nor 4e\n−\npathway) regarding the Co–N\n\nstructure\n\n,\n\n. Thus, it is highly desirable to discover which physical factor regulates the catalytic activity and selectivity in atomic precision. Our strategy allows the fine-tuning of the heterogeneous catalytic activity for H\n\nO\n\nproduction over a wide pH range, which results in a kinetic current density of 2.8 ± 0.2 mA cm\n−2\n(at 0.65 V) and a mass activity of 155 ±6 A g\n−1\n(at 0.65 V) with negligible activity loss over 110 hours in basic condition. Our highly active and stable SAC that comprises non-precious metals is easily scalable (Supplementary \n) and our concept can be generalized to other carbon materials (Supplementary \ngives details), which opens up the possibilities for industrially viable electrochemical H\n\nO\n\nproduction.

Dozens of single-atom catalysts have been developed, and they exhibit notable catalytic activity and selectivity that are not achievable on metal surfaces. Although promising, there is limited knowledge about the boundaries for the monometallic single-atom phase space, not to mention multimetallic phase spaces. Here, single-atom catalysts based on 37 monometallic elements are synthesized using a dissolution-and-carbonization method, characterized and analysed to build the largest reported library of single-atom catalysts. In conjunction with in situ studies, we uncover unified principles on the oxidation state, coordination number, bond length, coordination element and metal loading of single atoms to guide the design of single-atom catalysts with atomically dispersed atoms anchored on N-doped carbon. We utilize the library to open up complex multimetallic phase spaces for single-atom catalysts and demonstrate that there is no fundamental limit on using single-atom anchor sites as structural units to assemble concentration-complex single-atom catalyst materials with up to 12 different elements. Our work offers a single-atom library spanning from monometallic to concentration-complex multimetallic materials for the rational design of single-atom catalysts.\nYou have full access to this article via\nTsinghua University\n.\nDownload PDF\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nScalable two-step annealing method for preparing ultra-high-density single-atom catalyst libraries\nArticle\n\nSynthesis of ultrahigh-metal-density single-atom catalysts via metal sulfide-mediated atomic trapping\n\nArticle\n\nMethods\nand Supplementary \nfor details) deviate from those based on the XANES fitting with\nM\nN\n\nand\nM\nO\n\nfrom the more complicated temperature-dependent relationship between thermodynamics and kinetics during the non-equilibrium synthesis process (Supplementary \n).

Then, by controlling the species and concentrations of multiple metal precursors, multimetallic SAs, such as 2-, 8- and 12-metal SACs, are successfully achieved, with their atomic dispersions verified by aberration-corrected STEM imaging and XAFS measurement –f\nand Supplementary Figs.\n64–67\n). The 8- and 12-metal SACs with high metal loading are extremely difficult to synthesize because each metallic atom in the 8- and 12-metal SACs must overcome the aggregations with not only themselves but also any one of the other metallic atoms. However, we synthesized an eight-metal SAC containing V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn (Supplementary \n) and a 12-metal SAC with Sc, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Pd, Hf and W \nand Supplementary Figs.\n66–68\n). Atomic-resolution STEM images show that the SAs are all atomically and uniformly dispersed across the carbon support –d\n), which is further confirmed by the XAFS spectra in\n\nand Supplementary \n, as well as the EXAFS fitting results in Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n. The contents and valence states of the SAs were determined by ICP-MS and XPS, respectively, as shown in \n, Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n. The total metal loading of the 12-metal SAC reaches 7.53 wt%, which is considered a high value. These results demonstrate that there is no fundamental limit on using SA anchor sites as structural units to assemble concentration-complex multimetallic SAC materials.\n\n, Close-up view of the boxed region in\na\n.\nc\n, Pseudocolour surface plot of a randomly selected area in\na\n, showing SAs with various contrasts in the matrix.\nd\n, HAADF-STEM image and energy-dispersive spectroscopy elemental maps.\ne\n, FT-EXAFS spectra for SAs (turquoise) and corresponding reference foils (orange).

To explore their electrocatalysis, we performed electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) experiments on the 12-metal SAC, the corresponding mechanically mixed 12 monometallic SACs and the corresponding individual monometallic SACs. Representative OER currents of the samples were measured in 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at a scan rate of 10 mV s\n−1\n. The current density, mass activity and turnover frequency of the 12-metal SAC are higher than those of the mixed and individual monometallic SACs at the same potentials, indicating higher activity of the 12-metal SAC for OER \nand Supplementary \n). Also, the eight-metal SAC has a higher OER activity than its corresponding mixed monometallic SACs (Supplementary \n). To explore the active species in the 12-metal SAC for OER, we tested OER activities based on Fe, Co and Ni groups that have been reported to have promising performances for OER\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, such as Fe–Ni SAC, Fe–Co SAC, Co–Ni SAC, Fe–Co–Ni SAC, Fe–Co–W SAC, Fe–Co–Ni–Cu SAC and Fe–Co–Ni–Mn SAC. The results of OER activity in Supplementary \ndemonstrate the following OER activity order: Fe–Ni SAC < Fe–Co SAC < Co–Ni SAC; Fe–Co–W SAC < Fe–Co–Ni SAC; Fe–Co–Ni–Cu SAC < Fe–Co–Ni–Mn SAC; Co–Ni SAC < Fe–Co–Ni SAC < Fe–Co–Ni–Mn SAC. From the order, the OER activity of the quadmetallic Fe–Co–Ni–Mn SAC is better than that of the trimetallic Fe–Co–Ni SAC and far better than that of the bimetallic Co–Ni SAC. The activity of the 12-metal SAC is better than that of the quadmetallic Fe–Co–Ni–Mn SAC. Therefore, we conclude that the multi-element synergistic interaction in the 12-metal SAC can further enhance the OER activity. Moreover, we ran OER on the 12-metal SAC at a constant current of 10 mA cm\n−2\ncontinuously for 130 h. No appreciable increase in potential was observed in this time interval \n), which indicates the high stability of the 12-metal SAC for OER. The stability of OER electrolysis can be assigned to the stable structure resulting from the strong bonding between the metals and the support\n\n.\nIn summary, we have built a single-atom library ranging from monometallic to concentration-complex multimetallic materials. The big data analyses of the correlation of SAC properties in the library not only provide unified principles to understand the nature of active sites in different kinds of SAC, but also inspire a deeper insight into the SAC formation mechanism. This work may open up exponentially more complex multimetallic phase spaces for SACs and inspire new research areas for SAC discovery and optimization, where the elemental composition of SACs can be leveraged in controlling SAC synthesis and activity.\n\nMethods\nSynthesis\nThe monometallic catalysts were synthesized by a dissolution-and-carbonization method. A schematic illustration of the synthetic process is shown in Supplementary \n. Typically, 144 mg of glucose (C\n\nH\n\nO\n\n) was dissolved in 40 ml of ethanol. Meanwhile, the metal salt precursor (see details in Supplementary \n) and 690 mg of hydroxylamine hydrochloride ((NH\n\nOH)Cl) were ultrasonically dissolved in 40 ml of deionized water. Subsequently, the ethanol and water solutions were mixed. The mixture was dried in a drying oven at 70 °C for 12 h. Afterwards, it was placed in a crucible, heated from room temperature to 600 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min\n−1\nunder Ar atmosphere and kept there for 4 h for carbonization. The obtained product was milled into fine powder for further characterization. Exceptionally, since AgNO\n\nprecursor can react with the Cl\n−\nin (NH\n\nOH)Cl to form AgCl precipitation (Supplementary \n), the (NH\n\nOH)Cl was replaced by tripolycyanamide with the same molarity as the (NH\n\nOH)Cl for the synthesis of Ag SACs. For the synthesis of multimetallic SACs, the procedures are the same as for the monometallic catalysts except that multiple metal salt precursors instead of single ones were added, and the weight of each metal precursor was controlled according to Supplementary \n.\nMoreover, the SACs by the MOF method were synthesized with reference to the reported research\n\n,\n\n. Specifically, 2.4 g of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 40 ml of methanol by sonication for 5 min. 1.07 g of Zn(NO\n\n)\n\n·6H\n\nO and the given amount of a metal precursor (see Supplementary \nfor details) were dissolved in 40 ml of methanol by sonication for 5 min. The two solutions were mixed by magnetic stirring for 12 h. The as-obtained precipitates were centrifuged, washed with methanol several times and dried in vacuum at 70 °C. The dried powder was placed in a tube furnace and then heated to the desired temperature (900 °C) for 3 h at the heating rate of 5 °C min\n−1\nunder flowing Ar gas. Then, it was naturally cooled to room temperature and ground into fine powder to obtain the representative samples. The as-prepared products were directly used without any post-treatment.\n\nCharacterization\nXRD patterns were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/max 2500) at a scan rate of 10° min\n−1\nin the 2\nθ\nrange of 10°–90°. Scanning electron microscopy images were taken on a Verios 460L operated at 20 kV. Atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM images and energy-dispersive spectroscopy mappings were taken using an FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 S/TEM with a probe corrector operated at 200 keV and a JEOL JEM-ARM300F Grand ARM S/TEM with double correctors operated at 300 keV. The atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM images were processed by Richardson–Lucy deconvolution (four iterations)\n\nusing the DeconvGUI app (\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/deepem/software-development\n). Ex situ XAFS measurements were carried out at beamline 7-BM of National Synchrotron Light Source II, Brookhaven National Laboratory, beamline TPS 44A of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center and beamline 20-BM-B of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Soft XAS spectra were collected using both total electron yield and partial fluorescence yield modes at room temperature in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber (base pressure about 10\n−9\ntorr) at the IOS (23-ID-2) beamline of National Synchrotron Light Source II. Raman spectra were obtained using a HORIBA Evolution high-resolution confocal micro-Raman spectrometer. Ex situ XPS measurements were performed on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD system with Al Kα radiation as the X-ray source. Thermogravimetric analysis measurements were performed on a 209F3A NETZSCH thermal analyser with a ramp rate of 10 °C min\n−1\nunder N\n\natmosphere. Metal contents of SACs were analysed by ICP-MS (Thermo Fisher iCAP RQ ICP-MS).\nIn situ XAFS experiments were performed at beamline 7-BM of National Synchrotron Light Source II. The precursor mixture of ammonium molybdate, hydroxylamine hydrochloride and glucose for the synthesis of the Mo SAC was pressed and mounted on a holder of a Nashner–Adler reaction cell. The mixture was heated under Ar protection and its XAFS spectra were recorded at given temperatures.\nIn situ XPS experiments were performed using a system that counts with an X-ray electron detector (SPECS PHOIBOS 100MCD analyser) and an Al Kα X-ray source with a photon energy of 1,486.6 eV. The dried precursor mixture of ammonium molybdate or manganese nitrate, hydroxylamine hydrochloride and glucose for the synthesis of Mo SAC or Mn SAC was pressed on a Cu substrate, transferred to the XPS chamber and heated in ultrahigh vacuum. The XPS spectra were recorded at given temperatures.\nIn situ soft XAS data were collected with total electron yield signal on the TLS-BL24A beamline, NSRRC. During the measurement, the samples were mounted on the non-oxygen copper plate and heated at given temperatures under high-vacuum conditions.\n\nEXAFS fitting optimization\nThe EXAFS data were processed using the Athena and Artemis modules implemented in the IFEFFIT software packages\n\n. The raw data of the EXAFS spectra were first preprocessed using the Athena module. For each entire spectrum, the pre-edge background absorption was subtracted, and the post-edge was normalized to unity. The data were then transformed from the energy space into the photoelectron momentum vector\nk\nspace, and a\nk\n\n-weighted method was employed to compensate for oscillatory decay. Finally, the\nR\n-space spectra were obtained by Fourier transformation of the\nk\n\n-weighted\nχ\n(\nk\n) function using a Hanning window. Afterwards, the Artemis module was utilized to extract the local structure information from the spectra by using the least-squares curve parameter fitting method. We performed an extremely large structure search for metal SAs and executed EXAFS fitting optimization on each of the potential structural models we found. The atomic distances between centre metal atoms and their scattering atoms were initially set to our DFT results and then optimized during the fitting process. Finally, the fitting results with the best EXAFS fitting quality (represented by\nR\n-factor, the smaller the better) along with the atomic structure models are shown in \nand Supplementary \n.\nXANES calculation methods\nIn this work, we have performed the theoretical XANES calculations to explore the local structure of each single-atom metallic element within the FDMNES package in the framework of a real-space full multiple-scattering scheme with the muffin-tin approximation\n\n,\n\n. The energy-dependent exchange–correlation potential was calculated in the real Hedin–Lundqvist scheme, and then the XANES spectra were convoluted using a Lorentzian function with an energy-dependent width to account for the broadening from both the core-hole and final-state widths. A cluster of 7.0 Å radius containing ~70 atoms was used in the calculation, with satisfactory convergence being achieved. The structural models for XANES fitting were built on the basis of the EXAFS fitting results and were further optimized by DFT. Quantitative XANES fittings were carried out on each single-atom metallic element to approach the real local structure by optimizing the agreement between calculation and experiment. The fitting qualities were evaluated using the\nR\n-factor.\nDFT calculations of formation energy\nSpin-polarized DFT calculations using the projector-augmented wave method were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package\n\n,\n\nwith the electron exchange and correlation described by the generalized-gradient approximation as parametrized by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof\n\n. Plane-wave cutoff energy of 520 eV and a 4 × 4 × 1 Γ-centred\nk\n-point grid generated by the Monkhorst–Pack scheme were used for all calculations. The cell shape and atomic positions in the supercells were fully relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman force acting on each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å\n−1\n. The conjugate gradient algorithm\n\nwas used for the electronic optimization, and the convergence was considered to be reached when the total energy difference was less than 10\n−5\neV between iterations. For the examined SACs, each of the\nM\nO\n\nand\nM\nN\n\ncentres was constructed by creating a double vacancy in a 5 × 5 graphene sheet. A vacuum thickness of more than 15 Å was added in the vertical direction to avoid interactions between periodic images. The atomic coordinates of the optimized models are provided in\nSupplementary Data\n.\nThe formation energy (\nE\nf\n) of an\nM\nO\n\nor\nM\nN\n\ncentre for SAC is defined as\n$${{E}}_{{{\\mathrm{f}}}}{{ = E}}_{{{{\\mathrm{tot}}}}}{{{\\mathrm{ - }}}}\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_{{i}} {{\\mu }}_{{i}}{{x}}_{{i}}$$\n\nwhere\nE\ntot\nis the total energy from DFT calculations, and\nμ\ni\nand\nx\ni\nare the chemical potential and quantity of element\ni\nin the corresponding SAC, respectively. The\nμ\nvalue for a metallic element is referenced to one metal atom in the corresponding bulk crystal, and the\nμ\nfor C, N and O are taken from one atom in graphene, N\n\nand O\n\n, respectively. The correction energies of 0.359 and 0.113 eV per atom were used to correct the energies of O and N atoms, which were obtained by partially fitting the DFT-calculated formation energies to the Open Quantum Materials Database\n\n. The DFT-calculated\nE\nf\nof the\nM\nO\n\nand\nM\nN\n\ncentres are shown in Supplementary \n.\nWorking electrode preparation\nThe preparation of the working electrode was carried out as follows: a 6 mg catalyst was first dispersed in 500 µl of ethanol. Then, 500 µl of Nafion solution (0.5%) was added to the suspension, followed by sonication for 1 h to form the homogeneous ink. 200 µl of the ink was dropped onto a 1 × 1 cm\n−2\ncarbon paper in four drops and dried at room temperature for electrochemical measurements."

The reaction content was degassed for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 550 μl trioctylphosphine was added to the reaction mixture. The flask was further degassed at 50 °C for 30 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 300 °C at a rate of ~20 °C min\n−1\nand kept at this temperature for 15 min. The NPs were washed following the procedure described above.\n\nSynthesis of Pt@POF\nThe POF was prepared using standard air-free Schlenk techniques following a previously reported procedure\n\n. First, 9.3 g melamine (99%, Acros Organics) and 15 g terephthalaldehyde (99%, Acros Organics) were added to 495 ml dimethylsulfoxide (99.9%, Fisher) in a three-necked flask. The content was degassed at room temperature for 15 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 180 °C at a rate of ~20 °C min\n−1\nand kept at this temperature for 72 h. The solid product was washed with acetone three times and dried under vacuum (~150 torr) at 80 °C for 24 h to give a yield of 64%. Then, 8 mg Pt NPs in hexanes was added dropwise to 400 mg POF dispersed in 10 ml of a 1:9 mixture of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and hexanes under vigorous stirring. The mixture was stirred for 20 min to allow the NPs to adsorb onto the support. The observation of colourless supernatants indicated the complete adsorption of the NPs. The solvents were then removed by centrifugation (8,586\n\nSynthesis of supported Pt and Pd–Pt\nThe appropriate amount of Pt or Pd–Pt NPs was added to the alumina support dispersed in hexanes under vigorous stirring to achieve a nominal metal loading of 0.5 wt%. The mixtures were stirred for 20 min to allow the NPs to adsorb onto the support, and the catalysts were recovered by centrifugation (8,586\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41563-022-01376-1\nSource: main text file\n\n. The NP size remained the same throughout the synthesis procedure, as evidenced by particle size distribution analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; –d\n). Finally, the Pt@POF sample was converted into Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nthrough the infiltration of an alumina precursor into the pores of the polymer and subsequent removal of the polymer by calcination\n\nto produce the Pt@Al\n\nO\n\ncatalyst \n). This calcination step at 600 °C did not result in any measurable sintering of the Pt NPs. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) showed the uniform dispersion of small Pt NPs throughout the porous alumina grains \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). The Pt weight loading was determined to be\n∼\n0.5 wt% by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements \n), and 0.76 wt% by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; Supplementary \n). Thermogravimetric analysis of the material showed less than 3 wt% loss of the sample mass upon heating in air to 700 °C, likely due to the loss of adsorbates from storage in air (Extended Data \n). Nitrogen physisorption experiments showed that the alumina was mesoporous with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of 42 m\n\ng\n−1\n(Extended Data ,c\n).\n\nO\n\n.\nb\n–\ne\n, Representative TEM images with the corresponding NP size distributions of the starting Pt NPs (\nb\n), Pt NPs deposited on the POF (Pt/POF) (\nc\n), Pt NPs encapsulated in the POF (Pt@POF) (\nd\n) and Pt NPs encapsulated in Al\n\nO\n\nafter calcination at 600 °C (Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n) (\ne\n). f, Representative HAADF-STEM image of Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n.

For comparison, we prepared several control samples, namely Pt/Al\n\nO\n3,\nPt/γ-Al\n\nO\n\nand Pt-free Al\n\nO\n\n(Supplementary \n). The Pt/Al\n\nO\n\nsample was prepared using the same Pt NPs and alumina as for Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n, except that the NPs were deposited on the alumina surface, thus simulating a conventional supported catalyst (Extended Data ,b\nand \n). The Pt/γ-Al\n\nO\n\nsample was prepared by depositing the same Pt NPs on a commercial γ-Al\n\nO\n\nsupport. Unlike the encapsulated sample, Pt/Al\n\nO\n\nshowed intense Pt 4\nd\n5/2\nand 4\nd\n3/2\nXPS signals (Extended Data \n) as well as Pt 4\nf\n7/2\nand 4\nf\n5/2\nsignals overlapping with the Al 2\np\nsignal (Extended Data \n), demonstrating the surface location of the particles. These Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nand Pt/Al\n\nO\n\nsamples, therefore, represent catalysts with the same Pt NPs and textural support properties, but with different locations of the metal particles.\nCatalytic performance studies\nThe catalytic activity and stability were assessed using the complete oxidation of propene as a model reaction for the combustion of residual hydrocarbons in emission control systems (Supplementary \n). Hydrocarbons, including propene, are among the most abundant exhaust gases emitted into the atmosphere\n\n. In both of the as-prepared Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nand Pt/Al\n\nO\n\ncatalysts, complete propene conversion was reached at ca. 215 °C in a reaction flow containing a low concentration (0.15 vol.%) of propene, 3 vol.% oxygen and 5 vol.% steam to simulate exhaust conditions \n). After aging at 800 °C for 2 h in the reaction mixture, the two samples showed very different performances. The activity of the 800 °C-aged Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n(labelled Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n-800) was similar to that of the as-prepared catalyst, as evidenced by the <3 °C difference in the temperature required to reach complete propene conversion. By contrast, the aged Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n-800 sample showed a loss of activity, demonstrated by the shift in the light-off curve by 35 °C towards higher temperatures. The Pt-free alumina support was much less active (Extended Data \n), thus demonstrating that the activity was due to the Pt phase. Replicate measurements showed that the reactivity data persisted during multiple runs (Supplementary \nand Extended Data \n).\n\nO\n\nand Pt/Al\n\nO\n\ncatalysts, and after aging at 800 °C for 2 h in the reaction mixture (Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n-800 and Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n-800).

HAADF-STEM characterization of the as-prepared and aged Pt/Al\n\nO\n\ncatalysts showed an increase in the average Pt NP size from 3.8 to 17.2 nm ,e,h\n), with faceted particles of >100 nm clearly visible. This change is equivalent to a loss of 78% of the Pt surface area, which explains the large drop in Pt catalytic activity. In fact, the Pt/Al\n\nO\n\ncatalyst had sintered even after calcination at 600 °C (the temperature used to prepare the Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nsample), with the resulting powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns showing intense peaks from Pt and the TEM images showing an increase in average particle size from 3.8 to 23.2 nm (Extended Data ,f\n). Unlike Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n, the Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nsample showed that small particles were still present throughout the catalyst after aging at 800 °C, with irrelevant changes in particle size distribution ,g,i\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). The as-synthesized control catalyst Pt/γ-Al\n\nO\n\n(Supplementary \n) was as active as the Pt/Al\n\nO\n\nand Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nsamples (Extended Data \n), but exhibited the same drastic decrease in activity as the Pt/Al\n\nO\n\nsample after aging, again due to sintering of the Pt NPs from 3.8 to 13.7 nm (Extended Data –e\n). These results confirm that neither the underlying support chemistry nor its crystallinity played any role in stabilizing the Pt NPs.\nPXRD analysis showed the absence of strong diffraction peaks in the as-prepared catalysts, suggesting that the alumina was amorphous \nand Extended Data \n)\n\n. The aging process led to the crystallization of alumina and the appearance of diffraction peaks attributable to the γ-Al\n\nO\n\nphase\n\n,\n\n. Although it was not possible to determine Pt particle size by PXRD due to overlapping γ-Al\n\nO\n\nand Pt diffraction peaks at 40° (refs.\n\n,\n\n), no increase in the intensity of this peak was observed for the Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n-800 sample when compared to the bare alumina support \nand Extended Data \n). By contrast, the intensity of the diffraction peak at 40° in the Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n-800 sample increased compared with the diffraction peak at 67°, which is due to alumina. These results corroborate the particle size increase observed by TEM.\nBest-fit extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) models of the as-prepared and aged samples, collected ex situ, required only a metallic Pt–Pt scattering path \n, \n, Supplementary \nand Extended Data –f\n). The Pt NP size was estimated from the Pt–Pt coordination number \nand\nSupporting Information\n)\n\n. The EXAFS results, which represent the average of all the Pt in the sample, agreed with the characterization data reported above that indicated that the Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n-800 catalyst maintained a small Pt particle size, while the Pt NPs had sintered in the Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n-800 catalyst. The small discrepancies in the average particle sizes determined by EXAFS and TEM can be attributed to a change in the crystallinity and shape of the particles upon aging, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measuring the average coordination environment of the Pt NPs.\nFinally, XPS characterization of the aged Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n-800 did not show signals attributable to Pt, suggesting that the NPs remained encapsulated below the alumina surface, even after hydrothermal aging (Extended Data \n).\nKinetic rate measurements for propene combustion, normalized by the Pt mass, demonstrated the similar activity of the Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nand Pt/Al\n\nO\n\ncatalysts (Extended Data \n). The activation energies were 77 ± 6 and 57 ± 2 kJ mol\n−1\nfor Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nand Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n, respectively, clearly suggesting that the larger number of active sites in the encapsulated sample compensates for the higher activation barrier. These results demonstrate that the encapsulation process leaves most of the metal available for reaction, in contrast to previous studies where partial coverage of the catalytically active metal surface led to suppressed activity\n\n,\n\n,\n\n.\nWe then performed CO chemisorption and CO oxidation measurements to further characterize the catalysts. CO chemisorption yielded similar Pt dispersion values of 8 and 9% for the as-prepared Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nand Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n, respectively (Supplementary \n), confirming that the encapsulation process did not lead to a loss of available surface area. These values are lower than expected for 3.8 nm Pt NPs, which may be attributed to their interaction with the amorphous alumina support. Other studies have also reported low CO adsorption by supported Pt NPs despite their high CO oxidation activity\n\n,\n\n. Remarkably, the dispersion of the aged Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n-800 sample (7.5%) remained similar to the fresh sample, whereas it decreased drastically to 0.3% for the aged Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n-800 sample (Supplementary \n). Thus, the CO chemisorption data further corroborate the sintering-resistant properties of the encapsulated catalyst. Despite the lower CO chemisorption capacity than expected, both Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nand Pt/Al\n\nO\n\nwere similarly active in CO oxidation (Extended Data \n). Together, all these results demonstrate that the activity–stability trade-off can be overcome using our proposed templated encapsulation strategy.\nInvestigation of the stability of the encapsulated system\nDiffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) using CO as a probe molecule was used to characterize the metal surface. After exposure to CO, the Pt/Al\n\nO\n\nsample showed three convoluted vibrational contributions at ~2,083, 2,065 and 2,040 cm\n−1\n(Extended Data \n). The first two features have been assigned to CO linearly bound to under-coordinated metallic Pt sites such as corners and edges, while the feature at 2,040 cm\n−1\nis attributed to CO linearly bound to metallic Pt terraces\n\n. In the case of Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n, the DRIFTS spectrum was dominated by this last feature. A similar effect was observed for Pd catalysts coated with layers of alumina by atomic layer deposition\n\n. Researchers concluded that alumina preferentially decorated under-coordinated sites on the metal surface. We suggest that the same occurs in our Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nsample (Extended Data \n). Given that under-coordinated sites are more reactive towards oxygen, this characterization suggests that the alumina bonding in the Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nsample may reduce the emission of volatile PtO\n\nspecies\n\n,\n\n,\n\n.\nPrevious reports have suggested that defect sites in alumina, such as pentacoordinated Al\n3+\nsites (AlO\n\n), are able to stabilize metals and prevent them from sintering\n\n. The solid-state\n\nAl NMR spectra of the as-prepared samples showed a large fraction of AlO\n\nsites and resembled previously published data on amorphous alumina (Extended Data \n)\n\n. Although roughly half of the AlO\n\nsites were preserved, the NMR spectra of the aged Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n-800 and Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n-800 catalysts were similar. These results indicate that AlO\n\nor other specific alumina sites do not play a substantial role in stabilizing Pt against sintering.\nDensity functional theory calculations and sintering simulations were then conducted to provide insights into the enhanced stability achieved through encapsulation. The particle size distributions were described by a normal distribution with the experimentally observed mean particle size and standard deviation values. Sintering by Ostwald ripening via volatile PtO\n\n(g) was simulated using a mean-field model\n\n,\n\n. The fraction of reactive surface collisions of PtO\n\n(g) with the particles is given by a sticking coefficient\nS\n, where\nS\n= 1 indicates that every collision leads to PtO\n\nsticking to the surface. For Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n, we expect\nS\n= 1, in accordance with the properties of clean Pt surfaces\n\n. The reduced adsorption and emission of PtO\n\n(g) in Pt@Al\n\nO\n\n, which effectively leads to fewer collisions with the encapsulated particles, is described by a reduced effective sticking coefficient, which we denote\nS\neff\n. A more detailed explanation of the sintering kinetics is given in the\nSupporting Information\nand Extended Data \n.\n\nshows sintering as a function of\nS\neff\n. The surface energy of Pt was set to 110 meV Å\n−2\nto obtain a simulated final diameter of 16.6 nm for Pt/Al\n\nO\n\nafter 2 h at 800 °C in 3 vol.% O\n\n, which is in line with the experimental value of 17.2 nm. In 10 vol.% O\n\n, the simulations predicted increased sintering, with a final Pt NP average diameter for Pt/Al\n\nO\n\ngreater than 25 nm \n), in line with the hypothesis of PtO\n\n(g) being the species responsible for sintering. At\nS\neff\n= 1, the simulated sintering in the Pt@Al\n\nO\n\ncatalyst was greatly reduced compared with the Pt/Al\n\nO\n\nsample due to increased adhesion between the Pt particles and the alumina in the encapsulated sample geometry. However, the predicted size of Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nafter aging in 3 vol.% O\n\nmatched the experimental results only for\nS\neff\n< 0.1, indicating that further stabilization mechanisms are at play in this catalyst. To explore the effect of a higher oxygen concentration, we aged Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nin 10 vol.% O\n\n. The catalyst still maintained its activity \n), in agreement with the computational model in which the encapsulation geometry leads to decreased PtO\n\n(g) vapour exchange, as expressed by a value of\nS\neff\nof less than 0.01 in 10 vol.% O\n\n. The stability of the encapsulated Pt can therefore be explained by the combination of the higher adhesion energy and the lower rate of reactive surface collisions of PtO\n\n(g), which translate into slower sintering when Pt is embedded in the alumina framework. This result is also in line with the DRIFTS measurements, suggesting that the stabilization of under-coordinated Pt sites by alumina may reduce\nS\neff\n, as reflected in the sintering simulations.\n\nfinal\n, as a function of the effective sticking coefficient,\nS\neff\n, for Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nand Pt/Al\n\nO\n\nafter aging at 800 °C for 2 h in 3 and 10 vol.% O\n\n.

The calculations are described in detail in the\nSupplementary Information\n. Our conclusion is that diffusion limitation is important for PtO\n\nsintering, but does not affect the transport of propene and oxygen to the active sites and, therefore, the reactivity, mainly because of the difference in the partial pressures of the low concentration of PtO\n\nin the gas phase and the much higher concentrations of reactants and products.\nExtension to Pt–Pd systems for increased stability\nWe sought to further increase the thermal stability of the encapsulated sample by the addition of Pd to the catalyst formulation, which is known to reduce PtO\n\nvolatility (Supplementary \n)\n\n. We prepared 3.5 nm Pd–Pt bimetallic NPs with a Pd/Pt atomic ratio of 1:1. HAADF-STEM characterization and EDS mapping confirmed the co-location of Pd and Pt in the encapsulated NPs –c\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). The EDS quantification of 0.06 at.% for both Pd and Pt is in excellent agreement with the synthesis. Total weight loadings of the metals of 0.86 wt% (Supplementary \n) and 0.33 wt% (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n) were quantified at two different locations by EDS. A higher metal loading than the overall loading of 0.5 wt% was due to the fact that bare alumina was also formed during the synthesis. The activity of the 800 °C-aged PdPt@Al\n\nO\n\n(labelled PdPt@Al\n\nO\n\n-800) was similar to that of the as-prepared catalyst (Supplementary \n). We then aged the catalyst under more demanding conditions at 1,100 °C for 5 h in air (~21 vol.% O\n\n) and steam (10 vol.%; Supplementary \n). The sample maintained its activity, as evidenced by the overlapping light-off curves in \n. A control PdPt/Al\n\nO\n\nsample prepared by deposition of the same Pd–Pt NPs onto the alumina support was deactivated and drastically sintered after the severe aging treatment (Supplementary \n). The pure Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nand Pd@Al\n\nO\n\ncatalysts were also deactivated, demonstrating the importance of alloying (Extended Data \n), in agreement with previous findings\n\n. The metal-free support was much less active after aging at 1,100 °C, again indicating that the metal phase was responsible for the performance (Extended Data \n).\n\n, Representative HAADF-STEM image (\na\n) and the corresponding EDS maps at the Pd K-edge (\nb\n) and Pt L\n\n-edge (\nc\n) of as-synthesized PdPt@Al\n\nO\n\n.\nd\n, Propene combustion activity on fresh PdPt@Al\n\nO\n\nand 1,100 °C-aged PdPt@Al\n\nO\n\n.

Although it was not possible to image any discrete metal NPs by HAADF-STEM analysis of the 1,100 °C-aged catalyst, likely due to the increased alumina density after aging (Extended Data ,e\n), best-fit EXAFS models were consistent with the presence of metal NPs with direct interaction between Pt and Pd ,f\n, Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\n, and Extended Data \n). The coordination numbers indicate that the as-prepared catalyst comprises a core–shell metal geometry consisting of a platinum–palladium core surrounded by a palladium oxide shell that is transformed into bimetallic alloy NPs upon aging. EXAFS analysis of the supported PdPt/Al\n\nO\n\ncatalyst also showed the transformation of core–shell structures into Pd–Pt bimetallic alloys with similar coordination numbers (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\n). Furthermore, the PXRD and NMR data showed that the amorphous Al\n\nO\n\ncrystallized in the α-phase after aging (Extended Data ,g\n). Using Vegard’s law, we calculated the bulk composition of the Pd–Pt alloy to be Pd\n0.58\nPt\n0.42\n, in satisfactory agreement with the ratio of metals used in the synthesis and the EDS results. The thickness of the alumina layer, estimated from the low-loss portion of the scanning transmission electron microscopy electron energy loss (STEM-EEL) spectrum image using the log-ratio method\n\n, was 86 ± 32 nm (Supplementary \n). We suggest that the HAADF signal from the metal particles in the aged catalyst was below the detection limit given the thick alumina background.\nWe then further performed long-term aging experiments under alternating reducing and oxidizing conditions following accepted protocols (Supplementary \n)\n\n. The sample was observed to maintain its activity (Supplementary \n). Finally, we aged the Pd–Pt catalyst for 48 h at 800 °C in a mixture simulating diesel exhaust (Supplementary \n). The goal was to match, as closely as possible, the aging conditions to those of accepted protocols\n\n, with minor differences due to technical limitations. The material again was stable (Supplementary \n), further confirming the feasibility of our anti-sintering approach under practical conditions. We then attempted to model this result.\nThe only effect we considered in the modelling was the lowering of the surface energy, which can be expected for a Pd-terminated surface. Our sintering simulation for PtPd@Al\n\nO\n\nusing this condition showed greatly reduced sintering (Supplementary \n). For example, for\nS\n= 0.01, an increase in the initial mean diameter from 3.8 to 5.1 nm was predicted for Pt, whereas the change in mean diameter was less than 0.1 nm for Pt–Pd. Furthermore, it is plausible that in the case of a mainly Pd-terminated surface, the sticking coefficient of PtO\n\n(g) will be lower, and that the formation (or decomposition) of adsorbed PtO\n\n, which involves the diffusion of Pt from (or to) the bulk, will also be slower. It is important to stress, however, that our simulations only considered sintering via PtO\n\n(g). Overall, the catalytic and characterization data demonstrate that the encapsulation prevents the NPs from sintering, thereby maintaining the same level of catalytic activity in the aged sample as in the fresh catalyst.\nThe Pt-encapsulated alumina catalysts reported in this work demonstrate high stability under hydrothermal aging conditions, which is highly relevant for exhaust emission control. This catalyst design allows the preparation of active and stable catalysts for practical applications, with implications for reduced loadings of precious metals in catalytic converters. More broadly, this stabilization strategy can be extended to other formulations and areas of application, thus providing an opportunity to prepare stable supported catalysts with reduced metal loadings in systems where metal sintering is the main cause of catalyst deactivation.\n\nSynthesis of Pt, Pd–Pt and Pd nanoparticles\nAll chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Pt NPs were prepared by thermal decomposition of platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)\n\n, 99.98%) by colloidal synthesis using standard Schlenk techniques following a previously reported procedure\n\n. First, 10 ml trioctylamine (95%), 0.66 ml 1-oleylamine (70%) and 2.5 ml oleic acid (90%) were added to 79 mg Pt(acac)\n\nin a three-necked flask. The reaction content was degassed (<2 torr) for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 220 μl trioctylphosphine (97%) was added to the reaction mixture. The flask was further degassed at 120 °C for 30 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 350 °C at a rate of ~20 °C min\n−1\nand kept at this temperature for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction content was split into two centrifuge tubes, and each was washed with a mixture of 10 ml isopropyl alcohol and 20 ml ethanol and recovered by centrifugation (8,586\n\ng\n, 3 min). Finally, the NPs were suspended in hexanes. Pd NPs were synthesized using 77 mg Pd(acac)\n\n, 4.5 ml of 1-octadecene (ODE), 5.5 ml tetradecene, 1.66 ml 1-oleylamine and 0.567 ml trioctylphosphine. The reaction content was degassed at 50 °C for 30 min, heated to 225 °C under nitrogen at a rate of ~20 °C min\n−1\nand kept at this temperature for 30 min. For the Pd–Pt NP synthesis, 3.3 ml 1-oleylamine, 1.6 ml oleic acid and 40 ml 1-octadecene were added to 200.7 mg Pt(acac)\n\nand 157 mg Pd(acac)\n\nin a three-necked flask. The reaction content was degassed for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 550 μl trioctylphosphine was added to the reaction mixture. The flask was further degassed at 50 °C for 30 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 300 °C at a rate of ~20 °C min\n−1\nand kept at this temperature for 15 min. The NPs were washed following the procedure described above.\n\nSynthesis of Pt@POF\nThe POF was prepared using standard air-free Schlenk techniques following a previously reported procedure\n\n. First, 9.3 g melamine (99%, Acros Organics) and 15 g terephthalaldehyde (99%, Acros Organics) were added to 495 ml dimethylsulfoxide (99.9%, Fisher) in a three-necked flask. The content was degassed at room temperature for 15 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 180 °C at a rate of ~20 °C min\n−1\nand kept at this temperature for 72 h. The solid product was washed with acetone three times and dried under vacuum (~150 torr) at 80 °C for 24 h to give a yield of 64%. Then, 8 mg Pt NPs in hexanes was added dropwise to 400 mg POF dispersed in 10 ml of a 1:9 mixture of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and hexanes under vigorous stirring. The mixture was stirred for 20 min to allow the NPs to adsorb onto the support. The observation of colourless supernatants indicated the complete adsorption of the NPs. The solvents were then removed by centrifugation (8,586\n\ng\n, 3 min) and the powder was dried at 80 °C for 3 h. Organic ligands were removed by calcination in air at 300 °C for 20 min. The NPs were then encapsulated by growing an additional POF layer around the preformed Pt/POF material: 0.75 g Pt/POF was added to 1.18 g melamine and 1.87 g terephthalaldehyde dissolved in 61 ml dimethylsulfoxide. The mixture was heated to 180 °C as above, but for 24 h. The final material was washed three times with acetone as described above to obtain Pt@POF in a yield of 64%.\n\nSynthesis of Pt@Al\n\nO\n\nFirst, 18 g Al(NO\n\n)\n\n·9H\n\nO (>98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100 ml ethanol. Next, 1.2 g Pt@POF was added to the solution. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min, then ethanol was slowly removed in a rotary evaporator at 60 °C (water bath temperature) at 900 mbar for 1 h and then at 150 mbar for 1 h. The material was then dried under vacuum (~150 torr) at 80 °C for 24 h. The final product was obtained by calcining the sample at 600 °C for 5 h at a ramp rate of 0.5 °C min\n−1\n. This procedure resulted in purely mesoporous Al\n\nO\n\n. For the synthesis of a mix of micro- and mesoporous Al\n\nO\n\n, an ammonia solution in ethanol (24 ml ethanol mixed with 18 ml ammonia solution (2 M in ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich)) was added to the sample; ethanol was removed in the rotary evaporator, before removing the ammonia solution, again following the procedure described above.\n\nSynthesis of supported Pt and Pd–Pt\nThe appropriate amount of Pt or Pd–Pt NPs was added to the alumina support dispersed in hexanes under vigorous stirring to achieve a nominal metal loading of 0.5 wt%. The mixtures were stirred for 20 min to allow the NPs to adsorb onto the support, and the catalysts were recovered by centrifugation (8,586"

The DEMS analysis, coupled with galvanostatic measurement, further confirmed this conclusion (Supplementary Figs.\n\nexperimental observations of significantly improved OER stability in the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst.\nPEM–WE device performance\nFinally, to investigate the practical application potential of our Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst for water electrolysis, we constructed a PEM–WE electrolyser using Ni-RuO\n\nas the anode catalyst for OER, commercial Pt/C as the cathode catalyst for HER and a proton exchange membrane (Nafion 117; ,b\n). Pt/C was chosen due to its well-known properties of high durability and activity in HER. The current–voltage characteristic (I–V) curves (without iR compensation) in \nclearly show that the Ni-RuO\n\n/PEM/Pt/C electrolyser had improved water electrolysis activity compared with the RuO\n\nand Com-RuO\n\nelectrolysers. Specifically, the Ni-RuO\n\n-based electrolyser (at room temperature) required only 1.78, 1.95 and 2.10 V to reach a current density of 500, 1,000 and 1,500 mA cm\n−2\n, respectively \n). Of note, due to the lack of specific expertise and equipment in the fabrication of an industrial-level quality membrane electrode with minimal ionic resistance between cathode and anode, our device still presents impedance of ~0.3 Ω cm\n−2\n, contributing ~300 mV of iR drop at 1 A cm\n−2\n. This, however, does not affect the evaluation of our catalyst’s intrinsic activity (as shown in our standard three-electrode set-up) or the following durability tests.\n\n,\n\npreparation optimization (Supplementary \n). The faradaic efficiencies of O\n\ngenerated by the PEM–WE cell were measured as ~100% for Ni-RuO\n\n(Supplementary \n). We monitored Ru dissolution from the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst by ICP–MS during the 1,000 h stability test (Supplementary \n). A rapid increase in Ru concentration was observed at the very beginning of the operation, which could be ascribed to the dissolution of unstable Ru species during the catalyst activation process. Ru dissolution was gradually stabilized within the first 500 h and remain nearly unchanged, at ~30 ppb, for the remainder of the stability test. Additionally, our Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst can also be stably operated under an elevated electrolyte temperature for >1,000 h without obvious performance degradation (Supplementary \n). These stability results clearly demonstrate the great potential of our Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst for future practical applications.\nIn summary, we developed a non-iridium-based acidic OER catalyst that can deliver at least 1,000 h of stability under a 200-mA cm\n–2\nwater-splitting current in a PEM–WE device. The findings in this work not only provide an effective method and new understanding to improving catalytic performance of the RuO\n\ncatalyst, but also demonstrate its great future potential for implementation in practical PEM cells for large-scale clean H\n\ngeneration. While there is still a gap between our Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst’s stability performance and the typical industrial requirement (delivering >1 A cm\n−2\ncurrent for over 10 years of operation at 80 °C), this encouraging milestone stability that we achieved using a Ru-based catalyst clearly suggests the potential of replacing Ir-based catalysts in the future. More studies can be carried out in the future to further improve the stability of Ru-based catalysts, such as temperature effects, multi-element doping and so on.\n\nSynthesis of catalysts\nIn a typical procedure, 0.1721 g of RuCl\n\nand 0.0656 g of NiCl\n\n·6H\n\nO (that is, RuCl\n\npreparation, 16 µl of catalyst ink was drop-cast on a 5.0-mm-diameter glassy carbon electrode (disk geometric area, 0.196 cm\n\n), resulting in a catalyst loading of 0.4 mg cm\n−2\n, and then vacuum dried at room temperature before usage. All RDE measurements were run at room temperature in a typical three-electrode cell in an O\n\n-saturated 0.1 M HClO\n\nelectrolyte. A carbon rod (99.99%; Beantown Chemical) and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, CH Instruments) were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. An RDE assembly (no. AFE4TQ050, Pine Instruments) with the prepared glassy carbon electrode were used as the working electrode, at a rotation rate of 2,500 r.p.m. In this work, all potentials measured against SCE were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using:\n\npreparation process. The Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst was freshly annealed at 450 °C before use. We performed the same drop-casting process of Ni-RuO\n\nonto a platinized titanium fibre felt electrode. The Ni-RuO\n\n-coated electrode was then pressed under medium (~1.5 MPa) or high pressure (~3.0 MPa) by a hydraulic press machine at room temperature, followed by the same annealing process (350 °C for 30 min) to prepare the final OER anode. We then performed stability tests at 200 mA cm\n−2\nat room temperature and ambient pressure. Additionally, to reduce electrolyte flushing on the anode coating, we reduced the anolyte circulation flow rate from 4 ml min\n−1\nin our initial trial to 0.5 ml min\n−1\nfor medium- and high-pressure-prepared anode-based electrolysers, at room temperature and ambient pressure. All cell voltages measured in PEM–WE electrolysers were reported without iR compensation. Please be aware here that the slight voltage difference between I–V curves and chronopotentiometry stability tests may have arisen from the different electrolyser activization processes or electrolyser resistances.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41563-022-01380-5\nSource: main text file\n\nMethods\nand \n). First, a wet impregnation of metal precursors was adopted on a carbon black support, which was followed by H\n\n/Ar annealing reduction to obtain Ru\n\nNi nanoparticles supported on carbon black (Ru\n\nNi/C; \nand Supplementary Figs.\n1a\nand\n\n). The carbon support is important during this process in regard to the prevention of particle aggregation\n\n. Second, the obtained Ru\n\nNi/C was annealed in air to convert Ru\n\nNi nanoparticles to Ru\n\nNiO\nx\nand, meanwhile, to remove the carbon supports (Supplementary Figs.\n1b\nand\n\n). Finally, the obtained Ru\n\nNiO\nx\nunderwent an acid-leaching process to remove unstable Ni species and yield the final catalyst—that is, Ni-RuO\n\n. The air-annealing and acid-leaching processes greatly enhanced acidic OER performance (Supplementary \n), and the optimized air-annealing temperature was found to be 450 °C (Supplementary \n). The choice of Ni incorporation over other transition metals (Supplementary \n), and the Ru:Ni precursor molar ratio of 3:1 (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n), were determined after a rigorous performance optimization process.\n\n, Schematic illustrating the synthesis of Ni-RuO\n\n.\n\nb\n,\nc\n, TEM images of Ru\n\nNi/C (\nb\n) and Ni-RuO\n\n(\nc\n), showing the very small size of Ru\n\nNi and its derived Ni-RuO\n\nnanoparticles.\nd\n,\ne\n, HADDF–STEM images under different magnifications of Ni-RuO\n\n.\nd\nis a low-magnification HADDF–STEM image, and\ne\nis a high resolution HADDF–STEM image.\nf\n, Corresponding fast Fourier transform pattern of\ne\n.\ng\n, EDS mapping of the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst.

The distinct lattice in\ne\nsuggests the high crystallinity of our Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst.\nFull size image\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ni-RuO\n\nshowed the characteristic peaks of rutile RuO\n\n(JCPDS 71-2273) with the dominant peak at 28.1° (Supplementary \n), suggesting that incorporation of Ni did not affect the RuO\n\nlattice structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF–STEM) images –e\nand Supplementary \n) clearly showed that Ni-RuO\n\nnanoparticles were uniform in size, with an average diameter of ~4.0 nm \n, inset). This ultrafine nanoparticle size inherited from its precursor (that is, Ru\n\nNi/C), in which Ru\n\nNi nanoparticles had an average size of only 1.7 nm \n). High-magnification HAADF–STEM images clearly revealed that Ni-RuO\n\nnanoparticles exhibited high crystallinity, with distinct lattices observed \nand Supplementary –d\n). By focusing on individual nanoparticles, we observed well-defined lattice fringes that can be ascribed to the {110} planes of RuO\n\n,f\n). Another TEM image also showed a series of RuO\n\nlattices, including and (Supplementary \n). Successful incorporation of Ni was confirmed by energy-dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) elemental mapping \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Ni distribution was uniform across the entire RuO\n\nmatrix. We also synthesized RuO\n\nnanoparticles without incorporation of Ni (that is, RuO\n\n) as a control sample. The RuO\n\ncatalyst showed morphology similar to that of Ni-RuO\n\n, with an average nanoparticle size of ~4.5 nm (Supplementary \n), as well as high crystallinity, as confirmed by XRD (Supplementary \n).\nElectronic properties of catalysts\nThe X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum (Supplementary \n) revealed an Ni atomic ratio of 1.4 at.% (Ni:Ru ratio, ~1:21) in Ni-RuO\n\n. There were four peaks in the high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectrum \n): peaks at 856.0 and 873.9 eV were assigned to Ni 2p\n3/2\nand Ni 2p\n1/2\nof Ni\n2+\n, respectively, and those at 861.8 and 881.6 eV were ascribed to two accompanying satellites\n\n,\n\n. For high-resolution Ru 3d XPS spectra, two sets of doublet peaks were observed between 280 and 290 eV \n), which could be attributed to the doublet peaks of Ru\n4+\n3d\n5/2\n, 3d\n3/2\nand their satellite peaks\n\n,\n\n. The binding energy of Ru 3d\n5/2\nand 3d\n3/2\nfor Ni-RuO\n\nwas positively shifted (~0.1 eV) compared with that of RuO\n\n, possibly suggesting that Ru in the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst presented a slightly higher oxidation state than that in RuO\n\n(see the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra below for additional evidence). Previous studies revealed that Ru species with a higher oxidation state could enhance their OER activity\n\n,\n\n. In high-resolution O 1 s XPS spectra (Supplementary \n), peaks at 530.1, 531.3 and 532.9 eV were found to be Ru-O bonds, OH groups and H\n\nO, respectively\n\n,\n\n.

The Ni K-edge XANES suggested that the Ni oxidation state in Ni-RuO\n\nwas very close to NiO of +2 \n). The corresponding extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectrum of Ni-RuO\n\nat the Ni K-edge showed a dominant peak at around 1.6 Å \n), which was assigned to the Ni-O coordination. No obvious NiO or Ni metal nanoparticles were formed in Ni-RuO\n\nas suggested by the distinct EXAFS spectrum compared with the NiO or Ni reference, respectively, which indicates a high dispersion of Ni in the RuO\n\nlattice. This Ni-O coordination environment in Ni-RuO\n\nwas further confirmed by wavelet transform (WT) of its Ni K-edge, where one strong peak intensity was observed –i\n). We also analysed the XANES and EXAFS spectra of Ni-RuO\n\nand RuO\n\nat the Ru K-edge. While these two Ru K-edges appeared to be very close \n), a zoomed-in XANES spectrum revealed Ni-RuO\n\nshowing a slightly higher near-edge absorption energy and white line peak than those in RuO\n\n(Supplementary \n), suggesting a relatively higher Ru oxidation state in Ni-RuO\n\n, which agrees well with the XPS analysis. The Ru K-edge EXAFS spectrum of Ni-RuO\n\nis almost identical to that of RuO\n\n, suggesting the same coordination structures before and after the incorporation of Ni \nand Supplementary \n). The above characterizations clearly suggested that Ni dopants were uniformly distributed in the RuO\n\nlattice, in which Ru oxidation states were slightly shifted due to the incorporation of Ni atoms.\nElectrochemical characterization on a RDE in acidic electrolyte\nFollowing OER standard measurements\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, we first evaluated OER activities of the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst and control samples on a RDE set-up. The control samples were as-prepared RuO\n\nand commercial RuO\n\nnanoparticles (Com-RuO\n\n; see Supplementary Figs.\n17b\nand\n\nfor characterizations). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves showed that our as-synthesized RuO\n\npresented better OER activity than Com-RuO\n\n, mainly due to particle size effects \nand Supplementary \n). The overpotential for Com-RuO\n\nto deliver 10 mA cm\n−2\nwas 330 mV, consistent with previous reports\n\n,\n\n. Incorporation of Ni showed an obvious enhancement in the OER activity of RuO\n\n: the overpotential for Ni-RuO\n\nto reach 10 mA cm\n−2\nwas 214 mV, lower than that of RuO\n\n(227 mV). This overpotential difference was quickly increased following delivery of higher current densities, due to the significantly improved Tafel slope of Ni-RuO\n\n(42.6 mV dec\n−1\n) compared with both RuO\n\n(52.9 mV dec\n−1\n) and Com-RuO\n\n(60.7 mV dec\n−1\n) \n). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Ni-RuO\n\nat 1.45 V showed the lowest charge transfer resistance \n), suggesting enhanced OER kinetics compared with RuO\n\nand Com-RuO\n\n,\n\n. The superior activity of Ni-RuO\n\ncan be reliably repeated (Supplementary \n), and is among the best compared with other reported acidic OER catalysts (Supplementary \n).\n\n, LSV curves (\na\n) and Tafel slopes (\nb\n) of Ni-RuO\n\n, RuO\n\nand Com-RuO\n\n.\nc\n, EIS plots of Ni-RuO\n\n, RuO\n\nand Com-RuO\n\n.

Our prepared Ni-RuO\n\nand RuO\n\nwith ultrafine nanocrystal structures clearly showed higher\nC\ndl\nand ECSA than those of Com-RuO\n\nand Supplementary \n). In particular, Ni-RuO\n\nhad the highest\nC\ndl\nand ECSA, nearly twice those in RuO\n\n, suggesting that incorporation of Ni can significantly improve the density of active sites. Considering ECSA-normalized OER activity, specific activity still followed the order Ni-RuO\n\n> RuO\n\n> Com-RuO\n\n), suggesting intrinsically improved OER activity on the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst due to incorporation of Ni.\nWhile achieving high OER activity is important, good stability may play an even more important role in practical water-splitting applications\n\n,\n\n. We investigated OER durability in acidic electrolyte at 10 mA cm\n−2\non RDE \n), a widely adapted benchmark criterion in literature\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Although our synthesized RuO\n\nshowed improved stability compared with Com-RuO\n\n, its performance still degraded at a rapid rate and lasted no longer than 40 h. This performance degradation was markedly mitigated by incorporation of Ni. Our Ni-RuO\n\npresented a negligible potential increase after 200 h of continuous operation, suggesting a much more stabilized structure compared with RuO\n\nunder acidic OER conditions. This was also confirmed by cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests (Supplementary \n). The excellent durability of Ni-RuO\n\noutperformed state-of-the-art, non-Ir-based acidic OER catalysts reported in RDE tests \nand Supplementary \n). We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) to examine the electrolyte during chronopotentiometry stability testing of Ni-RuO\n\n(Supplementary \n). This yielded only ~10 ppb of Ru and 1 ppb of Ni in the electrolyte after stability testing, representing ~3.3% of the total material. The stability number (\nS\n) was 7.4 × 10\n\nat 205 h for Ni-RuO\n\n(Supplementary \n), which is comparable with rutile IrO\n\n(~10\n\n; Alfa-Aesar)\n\nand other reported IrO\n\n(~10\n\n; Sigma-Aldrich)\n\n, further demonstrating the excellent stability of Ni-RuO\n\n. No obvious changes were observed in either Ni and Ru K-edge of Ni-RuO\n\nunder in situ XAS measurements (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). Furthermore, we systematically characterized post-catalysis Ni-RuO\n\n, which suggested that both structures and properties of the catalyst were retained well (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). The excellent OER durability of Ni-RuO\n\ncompared with pristine RuO\n\nclearly indicates the critical role of Ni incorporation.\nUnderstanding the mechanism\nWe performed DFT simulations to understand the effects of Ni dopants on OER performance, in particular the stability of the RuO\n\ncatalyst. Consistent with our XRD observation (Supplementary \n), RuO\n\ncrystals were modelled to have a rutile lattice structure. Moreover, we chose to study the catalytic properties of the fully oxidized surface of RuO\n\nand Supplementary \n) because that was predicted to be the most stable surface in our RuO\n\ncatalyst annealed at 450 °C\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. In the outermost layer of the RuO\n\n surface there are two types of Ru site: the coordinatively unsaturated site (CUS) and the fully coordinated bridge site (BRI). The Ru atom has five coordinated O atoms at a CUS Ru site but binds to six O atoms at a BRI site\n\n. Our DFT results indicate that it would be energetically favourable for a Ni dopant to replace the BRI Ru site rather than the CUS site (Supplementary \n). Additionally, simulated EXAFS based on this proposed atomic structure agrees well with our experimental tests (Supplementary \n). We thus adopted such a Ni-doped RuO\n\n surface to examine the impacts of incorporation of Ni on the OER process \nand Supplementary \n).\n\n, Atomistic structures of the surfaces of RuO\n\n (\na\n) and Ni-RuO\n\n (\nb\n).\nc\n, Schematic illustration of AEM and LOM for OER on the RuO\n\n surface.

Subsequently, the reaction pathway bifurcates into one of two possible mechanisms: lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) or AEM\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Following LOM, surface-adsorbed *O further reacts with a lattice O to produce O\n\nwhereas the generated O vacancy is refilled by another H\n\nO. Following AEM, the surface-adsorbed O further reacts with another H\n\nO in the electrolyte to form *OOH and then the final product of O\n\n. We note that hydrogen bonds between H and an adjacent O helped stabilize OOH adsorption at the CUS Ru site on the RuO\n\n surface (Supplementary \n)\n\n,\n\n. Supplementary \nshows the DFT-predicted free energy evolution for OER via AEM on the RuO\n\n surface. The OER limiting potential, defined as the lowest potential under which free energy evolution becomes downhill, is about 1.89 V on the RuO\n\n surface. Additionally, the rate-determining step for OER on the RuO\n\n surface was predicted to be the step of O transformation to OOH (Supplementary Note\n\n), consistent with a previous result\n\n,\n\n. In contrast, the limiting potential for OER via LOM was predicted to be 3.76 V (Supplementary \n), which is 1.87 V higher than that of AEM. This result suggests the OER on the RuO\n\n surface would be thermodynamically more favourable to follow the AEM mechanism rather than the LOM, consistent with a previous study\n\n.\nTo experimentally confirm this AEM pathway, we conducted operando DEMS measurements via the isotope\n\nO-labelling method \nand Supplementary \n). First we ‘labelled’ RuO\n\nand Ni-RuO\n\ncatalysts with\n\nO by performing OER under constant current density (\n\nMethods\n). If lattice oxygen is exchanged, the catalyst surface would be labelled by\n\nO. We then measured the isotope signal of evolved O\n\nduring OER in H\n\nO/0.1 M HClO\n\n. With gradual increase in OER current \n, top and Supplementary \n), a corresponding increase in both\n\nO\n\n(\n\nO +\n\nO) and\n\nO\n\n(\n\nO +\n\nO) signal was detected \n, middle and Supplementary \n). The signal ratio of\n\nO\n\n:\n\nO\n\nwithin the OER potential range \n, bottom and Supplementary \n) remained relatively constant and is comparable to that of the natural abundance of\n\nO in deionized water within experimental uncertainty\n\n,\n\n, suggesting that the LOM mechanism did not occur over both RuO\n\nand Ni-RuO\n\n. The DEMS analysis, coupled with galvanostatic measurement, further confirmed this conclusion (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), in which the constant\n\nO\n\nand\n\nO\n\nsignals and\n\nO\n\n:\n\nO\n\nratio were clearly observed. Our DEMS results are consistent with previous reports that also suggest the exclusivity of AEM over RuO\n\n-based OER catalysts\n\n,\n\n,\n\n.\nWith the OER pathway determined on the RuO\n\nsurface, the impacts of the incorporation of Ni on activity and stability could be evaluated via limiting potential and lattice stability calculations, respectively. First, the limiting potential of OER on the Ni-RuO\n\n surface was predicted to be 1.70 V \n), which is about 0.2 V lower than that of RuO\n\nand suggests improved OER activity. Regarding stability, we first evaluated enthalpy change for the surface Ru atom demetallation process from the surface of both RuO\n\nand Ni-RuO\n\n, because delamination of surface Ru atoms may contribute to the low stability of catalysts\n\n. The proposed demetallation process of Ru is presented in Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n, in which Ru at the CUS Ru site moves away from the surface. We found that with incorporation of Ni into the lattice, the energy cost for Ru demetallation increased from 1.87 to 2.22 eV \n, left), suggesting a more stable surface Ru in Ni-RuO\n\nthan in RuO\n\n. Computational results of the demetallation process are further discussed in Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary \n. To evaluate lattice oxygen stability, we calculated the enthalpy change of the subsurface oxygen loss process (Supplementary \n)\n\n,\n\n. The enthalpy changes for subsurface oxygen loss were calculated to be 1.67 and 2.12 eV \n, right) on the RuO\n\nand Ni-RuO\n\n surface, respectively, clearly suggesting that the introduction of Ni dopants to the RuO\n\nlattice had also stabilized lattice oxygen during OER. Consequently, our DFT simulations show that incorporation of Ni improves the OER stability of RuO\n\nby hindering both surface Ru demetallation and lattice oxygen loss, supporting our experimental observations of significantly improved OER stability in the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst.\nPEM–WE device performance\nFinally, to investigate the practical application potential of our Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst for water electrolysis, we constructed a PEM–WE electrolyser using Ni-RuO\n\nas the anode catalyst for OER, commercial Pt/C as the cathode catalyst for HER and a proton exchange membrane (Nafion 117; ,b\n). Pt/C was chosen due to its well-known properties of high durability and activity in HER. The current–voltage characteristic (I–V) curves (without iR compensation) in \nclearly show that the Ni-RuO\n\n/PEM/Pt/C electrolyser had improved water electrolysis activity compared with the RuO\n\nand Com-RuO\n\nelectrolysers. Specifically, the Ni-RuO\n\n-based electrolyser (at room temperature) required only 1.78, 1.95 and 2.10 V to reach a current density of 500, 1,000 and 1,500 mA cm\n−2\n, respectively \n). Of note, due to the lack of specific expertise and equipment in the fabrication of an industrial-level quality membrane electrode with minimal ionic resistance between cathode and anode, our device still presents impedance of ~0.3 Ω cm\n−2\n, contributing ~300 mV of iR drop at 1 A cm\n−2\n. This, however, does not affect the evaluation of our catalyst’s intrinsic activity (as shown in our standard three-electrode set-up) or the following durability tests.\n\n,\nb\n, Schematic (\na\n) and photograph (\nb\n) of the PEM–WE device.\nc\n, I–V curves of PEM–WE electrolysers using Ni-RuO\n\n, RuO\n\nor Com-RuO\n\nas anodic catalyst and commercial Pt/C as cathodic catalyst, at room temperature and ambient pressure. No cell voltages were iR compensated.\nd\n–\nf\n, Chronopotentiometry testing of Ni-RuO\n\nand RuO\n\ncatalysts at 200 mA cm\n−2\nin the PEM–WE electrolyser using commercial Pt/C as the cathode catalyst, at room temperature and ambient pressure. The Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst coating in these stability tests was press-prepared under low pressure (<0.5 MPa) (\nd\n), medium pressure (~1.5 MPa) (\ne\n) and high pressure (~3.0 MPa) (\nf\n).\nFull size image\nCatalyst stability could play an even more important role than its activity in practical applications; we thus evaluated the stability of our Ni-RuO\n\n-based electrolyser, as well as pristine RuO\n\nfor comparison, at 200 mA cm\n−2\n\n). The voltage of the RuO\n\nelectrolyser was clearly increased following ~120 h of electrolysis, suggesting poor OER stability under practical operation conditions \n). Remarkably, our Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst showed markedly improved PEM–WE durability: it was operated for 1,000 h with only a small cell voltage increase in our initial trial \n). We suspected the slight degradation in cell performance observed from ~700 h was probably due to detachment of the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst from the anode electrode during prolonged anolyte circulation and gas bubble evolution, because we observed the presence of some black material (most probably the catalyst) coated on the inner surface of the anolyte outlet tube after the stability test (Supplementary \n). We thus used an improved and stronger coating method to further explore the durability of the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst (\n\nMethods\n). The stability of two newly prepared anodes was further improved ,f\n): no obvious cell voltage increase was observed for these during 1,000 h stability tests. Additionally, much less black material was observed on the inner surface of the anolyte outlet tubes after stability tests compared with the initial trial (Supplementary \n). RuO\n\nstill showed much lower stability than Ni-RuO\n\nafter electrode preparation optimization (Supplementary \n). The faradaic efficiencies of O\n\ngenerated by the PEM–WE cell were measured as ~100% for Ni-RuO\n\n(Supplementary \n). We monitored Ru dissolution from the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst by ICP–MS during the 1,000 h stability test (Supplementary \n). A rapid increase in Ru concentration was observed at the very beginning of the operation, which could be ascribed to the dissolution of unstable Ru species during the catalyst activation process. Ru dissolution was gradually stabilized within the first 500 h and remain nearly unchanged, at ~30 ppb, for the remainder of the stability test. Additionally, our Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst can also be stably operated under an elevated electrolyte temperature for >1,000 h without obvious performance degradation (Supplementary \n). These stability results clearly demonstrate the great potential of our Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst for future practical applications.\nIn summary, we developed a non-iridium-based acidic OER catalyst that can deliver at least 1,000 h of stability under a 200-mA cm\n–2\nwater-splitting current in a PEM–WE device. The findings in this work not only provide an effective method and new understanding to improving catalytic performance of the RuO\n\ncatalyst, but also demonstrate its great future potential for implementation in practical PEM cells for large-scale clean H\n\ngeneration. While there is still a gap between our Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst’s stability performance and the typical industrial requirement (delivering >1 A cm\n−2\ncurrent for over 10 years of operation at 80 °C), this encouraging milestone stability that we achieved using a Ru-based catalyst clearly suggests the potential of replacing Ir-based catalysts in the future. More studies can be carried out in the future to further improve the stability of Ru-based catalysts, such as temperature effects, multi-element doping and so on.\n\nSynthesis of catalysts\nIn a typical procedure, 0.1721 g of RuCl\n\nand 0.0656 g of NiCl\n\n·6H\n\nO (that is, RuCl\n\nand NiCl\n\nat a molar ratio of 3:1) were mixed in 150 ml of 1 M HCl and sonicated for 2 h. Carbon black (0.4 g; Cabot, BP2000) was then added and dispersed by stirring for 18 h under room temperature to ensure uniform distribution. Next, the mixture was dried by using a rotary evaporator and the remaining powder was collected. The powder was annealed in a flowing Ar/H\n\n(5% H\n\n) atmosphere at 900 °C for 2 h and then annealed in air at 250–550 °C (450 °C as the optimized temperature) for 3 h. After annealing, 50 mg of product was added to 20 ml of 1 M HCl and mixed at room temperature for 12 h to perform acid leaching, then centrifuged and washed with deionized water three times. Finally, the sample was dried at 80 °C in an oven for 12 h to obtain the Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst. Ru\na\nNi\nb\nO\nx\n-AL samples with different amounts of Ni dopant were also prepared following the same procedure, except that the level of precursors was tuned in the first step. In addition, RuO\n\nwith no Ni incorporated was prepared in a similar method using RuCl\n\nas precursor. M-RuO\n\n(M=Fe, Co, Zn, Cu) samples with different metal dopants were also prepared using the same procedure, except that the precursors used in the first step were different—FeCl\n\n, CoCl\n\n, Zn(NO\n\n)\n\n·6H\n\nO, and CuCl\n\n·2H\n\nO. Of note, the weight ratio of total metal content in precursors to carbon black support was fixed at 1:4 in all catalyst synthesis.\n\nCharacterization\nTEM, HADDF–STEM and EDS elemental mapping were performed on a Talos F200X transmission electron microscope (at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV) equipped with an energy-dispersive detector. HR–TEM and HR–HADDF–STEM images were captured using a JEM-ARM 200 F atomic resolution analytical microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. XPS data were obtained on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALab MKII) with an excitation source of Mg Kα radiation (1,253.6 eV). XRD data were collected on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer. XAS measurements were conducted at the Sector 20-BM beamline of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. All XAS measurements were carried out at room temperature under ambient pressure. Samples were measured simultaneously in fluorescence mode with metal foils as reference. Data processing and EXAFS fitting were performed using the Athena program. The XAS data of NiO and Ni references are from our previous work\n\n.\nElectrochemical measurements under a three-electrode system\nIn a typical test, 5 mg of catalyst was added to 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 20 µl of Nafion-117-containing solution (5%; Sigma-Aldrich) and sonicated for 1 h to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst ink. For electrode preparation, 16 µl of catalyst ink was drop-cast on a 5.0-mm-diameter glassy carbon electrode (disk geometric area, 0.196 cm\n\n), resulting in a catalyst loading of 0.4 mg cm\n−2\n, and then vacuum dried at room temperature before usage. All RDE measurements were run at room temperature in a typical three-electrode cell in an O\n\n-saturated 0.1 M HClO\n\nelectrolyte. A carbon rod (99.99%; Beantown Chemical) and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, CH Instruments) were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. An RDE assembly (no. AFE4TQ050, Pine Instruments) with the prepared glassy carbon electrode were used as the working electrode, at a rotation rate of 2,500 r.p.m. In this work, all potentials measured against SCE were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using:\n\nE\n(potential, versus RHE) =\nE\n(versus SCE) + 0.241 V + 0.0591 × pH. In 0.1 M HClO\n\nelectrolyte, pH values are all equal to 1.0 in this work as determined by an Orion Star A111 pH meter (Thermo Scientific). Solution resistance (\nR\ns\n) was measured by potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 200 kHz. All measured potentials in RDE tests were 100% iR compensated unless otherwise specified. LSV tests were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s\n−1\n. Stability was examined by chronopotentiometry testing at 10 mA cm\n−2\n. EIS tests were performed at 1.45 V (versus RHE) from 0.1 Hz to 200 kHz, and the results are presented in the form of a Nyquist plot. The ECSA was determined by: ECSA =\nC\ndl\n/\nC\ns\n, where\nC\ndl\nis double-layer capacitance and\nC\ns\nthe specific capacitance of the sample. In this study, a general specific capacitance of\nC\ns\n= 0.035 mF cm\n−2\nwas used based on typical reported values\n\n.\nC\ndl\nwas determined by the equation\nC\ndl\n=\ni\nc\n/\nν\n, where\ni\nc\nis the charging current and\nv\nthe scan rate. A series of CV tests in the non-faradaic potential region 1.18–1.28 V (versus RHE) under different scan rates (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10, 15 and 20 mV s\n−1\n) were performed. And by plotting measured\ni\nc\nversus\nν\n,\nC\ndl\nwas obtained from the slopes of the linear fitting. The roughness factor was calculated by dividing ECSA by the geometric area of the electrode, which was 0.196 cm\n−2\nin this study. The\nS\n-number\n\nwas calculated using the following equation:\nS\n=\n\\(\\frac{{n_{{{{\\mathrm{O}}}}_2}}}{{n_{{{{\\mathrm{Ru(dissolved)}}}}}}}\\)\n, where\n\\(n_{{{{\\mathrm{O}}}}_2}\\)\nis the molar number of total oxygen evolved within a certain period of time (calculated from total charge) and\n\\(n_{{{{\\mathrm{Ru}}}}\\left( {{{{\\mathrm{dissolved}}}}} \\right)}\\)\nis total dissolved Ru as measured by ICP–MS.\nDEMS tests\nOne milligram of catalyst was mixed with 10 wt% of Nafion in 0.5 ml of ethanol and then drop-cast onto the glassy carbon (0.5-mm diameter) working electrode. The electrode was dried at room temperature for at least 1 h before testing. Measurement was performed on a HPR-40 DEMS (Hiden Analytical) coupled to the flow cell illustrated in \n, an Autolab potentiostat (no. PGSTAT204, Metrohm), an OER catalyst modified working electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode. Electrolyte flow rate was controlled at 0.5 ml min\n−1\n. All electrochemical results were recorded versus the reference electrode and converted to RHE following the relationship\nE\nRHE\n=\nE\nAg/AgCl\n+ 0.197 + 0.0591 × pH. Catalysts were first labelled with\n\nO in 0.1 M HClO\n\nsolution created with\n\nO-labelled water (97%\n\nO; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for 10 min at 10 mA cm\n−2\n. Electrodes and cell were then rinsed with\n\nO water for 20 min to remove any H\n\nO residual and scanned in a 0.1 M HClO\n\nsolution of H\n\nO at 0.5 mV s\n−1\nfrom 1.1 V versus RHE until current density reached 50 mA cm\n−2\n. An electron energy of 70 eV was used for ionization of all species, with an emission current of 450 μA. All mass-selected product (\nm/z\n= 32 and 34) was detected by a secondary electron multiplier with a detector voltage of 1,200 V. Data were averaged every ten points to yield a smoother MS signal, and\nm/z\n34/32 signals were calculated with the fitting data. For DEMS measurements using the galvanostatic method, after labelling and rinsing (as mentioned above) the background was collected for 10 min before the application of 10 mA cm\n−2\nfor 30 min to probe potential oxygen lattice exchange.\nPEM–WE tests\nFor electrolyser tests, a self-made cell was used as the PEM–WE device and a cation exchange membrane (Nafion 117) as the membrane electrolyte. Around 0.65 mg cm\n−2\ncommercial Pt/C with 20 wt.% Nafion 117 binder was air-brushed onto a carbon paper electrode as an HER cathode. In our initial trial \n), ~3.1 mg cm\n−2\nOER catalyst with 20 wt.% polytetrafluoroethylene binder was drop-cast onto a platinized titanium fibre felt electrode. After drying, the electrode was pressed at room temperature under a low pressure of <0.5 MPa by a regular hot-press machine. The electrode was then annealed in air for 30 min at 350 °C and used as an OER anode, which was then circulated with 0.1 M HClO\n\naqueous solution at 4 ml min\n−1\n. I–V curves were measured in galvanostatic mode at 50–2,200 mA cm\n−2\nat room temperature and ambient pressure. The stability test was carried out at 200 mA cm\n−2\nat room temperature and ambient pressure. To further improve the stability of the Ni-RuO\n\n-based PEM–WE device ,f\n), we optimized the electrode preparation process. The Ni-RuO\n\ncatalyst was freshly annealed at 450 °C before use. We performed the same drop-casting process of Ni-RuO\n\nonto a platinized titanium fibre felt electrode. The Ni-RuO\n\n-coated electrode was then pressed under medium (~1.5 MPa) or high pressure (~3.0 MPa) by a hydraulic press machine at room temperature, followed by the same annealing process (350 °C for 30 min) to prepare the final OER anode. We then performed stability tests at 200 mA cm\n−2\nat room temperature and ambient pressure. Additionally, to reduce electrolyte flushing on the anode coating, we reduced the anolyte circulation flow rate from 4 ml min\n−1\nin our initial trial to 0.5 ml min\n−1\nfor medium- and high-pressure-prepared anode-based electrolysers, at room temperature and ambient pressure. All cell voltages measured in PEM–WE electrolysers were reported without iR compensation. Please be aware here that the slight voltage difference between I–V curves and chronopotentiometry stability tests may have arisen from the different electrolyser activization processes or electrolyser resistances."

In conclusion, the Pt deposition process in Pt-DSA/TiO\n\nsynthesis method in hand\n), we next examined its general applicability towards the synthesis of various ADCs. We applied the same photochemical protocol for the deposition of Pt on different reducible oxides, such as ZnO and CeO\n\n). Although the EPR tracking analyses alone remain insufficient to reveal the detailed defect dynamics of ZnO and CeO\n\n, we were able to qualitatively observe similar trends in the variation in their EPR traces on photoactivation and subsequent quenching with the addition of Pt precursors.

We chose anatase TiO\n\nas a model oxide system and investigated its defect dynamics on the synthesis of corresponding ADCs using density functional theory (DFT) calculations \n). The computational results suggest that after light irradiation, the migration of bulk V\n\nO\ns to the surface is accompanied by a change in the oxidation states of adjacent Ti sites, which is expected to be thermodynamically favourable and kinetically competent \n, left). The spin density calculation also predicts the generation of a four-coordinated Ti\n3+\nsite (4cTi) next to the migrated V\nO\ns, featured by its high spin density with the corresponding magnetic moment (0.71\nμ\nB\n) \n, middle). The induced 4cTi site can then function as a reactive centre for the adsorption of a Pt\n4+\nprecursor followed by surface reconstruction \n, right). The incorporation of Pt on the 4cTi site is expected to be highly favourable (−1.96 eV), showing its strong thermodynamic preference to other Pt incorporation events on different sites with the same surface V\nO\ns \n). Considering the cohesion energy of a bulk Pt\n\nstate from a Pt\n4+\nion (+1.52 eV), the formation of the Pt-DSA state on the 4cTi site should outcompete the agglomeration of Pt atoms. On the basis of these theoretical guideposts, we propose a simplified mechanistic scheme for the photoinduced synthesis of ADCs on TiO\n\n. After light irradiation, excessive photoexcited electrons can be trapped at the surface sites under the photocatalytic HER condition, inducing the migration of bulk V\n\nO\ns to form surface Ti\n3+\n–V\nO\npairs. These Ti\n3+\n–V\nO\npairs would be highly reactive for the selective binding of metal atoms through specific metal atom–support interactions, where the localized electrons would drive surface reconstruction for formulating stable ADCs.\n\n.\na\n, Thermodynamics of the migration of V\nO\ns to the surface and Pt adsorption by the reorganization of surface Ti ions (changes in Gibbs free energy from the leftmost structure, in electronvolts).

Colour legends: blue, Ti; red, O; grey, Pt.\nFull size image\nEPR study and characterization of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\nOur experimental observations show agreements with the suggested photoinduced mechanism for the synthesis of ADCs \n). Under deaerated conditions, anatase TiO\n\nshowed a distinct electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal at\n\ng\n= 2.00, corresponding to native Ti\n3+\nstates with electron-trapped O\n−\nspecies from bulk V\nO\ns\n\n. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) light irradiation gave rise to a new EPR signal at\ng\n= 1.97, which we attribute to the emergence of disparate Ti\n3+\nstates and coupled V\nO\ns\n\n. Importantly, the rise of the new signal arises at the expense of a decrease in the original signal \n), which is in line with the proposed photoinduced migration of V\nO\ns (and coupled Ti\n3+\nstates). We also noticed that the colour of the TiO\n\ndispersion changed from white to blue on light illumination (Extended Data \n), which is an indication of charge accumulation at the trap states\n\n. When Pt precursors were added to the photoactivated TiO\n\n, its blue colour got quickly quenched, whereas the photoinduced EPR signal concurrently disappeared with the restoration of the original signal but in reduced intensity. The introduction of O\n\nto the photoactivated TiO\n\nin the absence of metal precursors also quenched the photoinduced EPR signal and the original signal was retrieved with almost the same intensity as its initial state \n). These results in aggregate—consistent with the above theoretical predictions—show the migration of bulk V\nO\ns to the surface with the aid of photogenerated electrons, which can serve as reactive interfacial sites for the atomistic deposition of metals.\n\n, EPR spectra to investigate Pt deposition on photochemically generated defects in TiO\n\n.\nb\n, EPR spectra to investigate the air regeneration process of photoirradiated TiO\n\n.\nc\n, Cs-STEM images of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n(bright dots represent Pt atoms).\nd\n, STEM-EDS elemental mapping of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n.\ne\n, Extended XAFS spectra of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n, Pt-NP/TiO\n\n, PtO\n\nand reference Pt foil.\nf\n, XPS spectrum of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n(pink line indicates Al2\np\n, which originates from residual Al in commercial anatase TiO\n\n(Supplementary \n)).\ng\n, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n, PtO\n\nand Pt foil.

Spherical-aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-STEM) \n) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping analysis \n) showed the uniform dispersion of atomic Pt on TiO\n\nwithout the formation of Pt aggregates or nanoparticles, which is further substantiated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, showing an absence of solid Pt phase within the sample (Extended Data \n). In particular, a severe aggregation of Pt was observed when the same light illumination was applied to a mixture of Pt precursor and TiO\n\n(Extended Data \n), suggesting that the preinduction of surface V\nO\ns (and Ti\n3+\n) and electronic charge accumulation on TiO\n\nare crucial for formulating stable Pt-single-atom-deposited TiO\n\n. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), X-ray absorption near-edge structure and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses further proved the atomic valence state of Pt within Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n. The extended XAFS spectrum of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\nappears completely disparate and exclusive from that of Pt foil and Pt nanoparticles on TiO\n\n(Pt-NP/TiO\n\n) and shows a distinctive peak at 1.67 Å, corresponding to the local coordination between Pt and O \n). The XPS spectrum of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\nshows Pt in the 2+ oxidation state \n), which is in line with the X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra, where the measured white-light intensity maximum of normalized absorption appears at ~11,568 eV (\n) and is placed between the Pt foil and PtO\n\n).\nTo validate the advantages of our photochemical-defect-tuning strategy, we conducted a comparative analysis between Pt-DSA/TiO\n\nand a single Pt atom deposited on hydrogenated TiO\n\n(Pt-SA/hydrogenated TiO\n\n) that was prepared by the conventional wet-impregnation method (Extended Data \n)\n\n,\n\n. The hydrogen treatment at high temperatures is known to induce surface disorder or defects. When we subjected commercial TiO\n\nto reduction at 500 °C in a 10% H\n\n/Ar atmosphere, signals related only to bulk V\nO\ndefects were observed (\ng\n= 2.00), and surface V\nO\ndefects were not generated (Extended Data \n). On depositing Pt onto hydrogenated TiO\n\nusing the same precursor concentration and stabilization time as those used for Pt-DSA 0.7 wt%/TiO\n\n, distinct EPR signals of Pt\nδ\n+\n(Pt\n+\nor Pt\n3+\n) appeared. These EPR signals were not present in Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n, because our photochemical-defect-tuning synthesis process exclusively leads to the formation of EPR-silent Pt\n2+\n. Furthermore, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging, EDS elemental mapping and XPS data of Pt-SA/hydrogenated TiO\n\nindicated that a certain portion of Pt atoms were severely agglomerated (Extended Data ,c\n). In conclusion, the Pt deposition process in Pt-DSA/TiO\n\ninvolves a specific interaction between the induced Pt atoms and reversible surface V\nO\ndefects, which gives rise to the specific Pt\n2+\nstate following dynamic surface reconstruction. On the other hand, Pt deposition on hydrogenated TiO\n\ninvolves non-specific interactions with irreversible surface disorders, leading to a mixed Pt state and severe agglomeration (Extended Data \n).\n\nWith the established synthesis method in hand\n), we next examined its general applicability towards the synthesis of various ADCs. We applied the same photochemical protocol for the deposition of Pt on different reducible oxides, such as ZnO and CeO\n\n). Although the EPR tracking analyses alone remain insufficient to reveal the detailed defect dynamics of ZnO and CeO\n\n, we were able to qualitatively observe similar trends in the variation in their EPR traces on photoactivation and subsequent quenching with the addition of Pt precursors. ZnO showed a distinct EPR signal at\n\ng\n= 1.956 related to singly ionized bulk V\nO\ns inside ZnO (\n). These bulk V\nO\ns decreased after irradiation due to their migration to the surface, with surface V\nO\ns exhibiting a signal at a slightly higher\ng\nvalue at\ng\n= 1.96 (\n). Surface V\nO\ns quickly vanished with Pt atom deposition along with a partial recovery of bulk V\nO\ns \n). The air exposure experiment conducted on irradiated ZnO indicated that the atomic deposition of Pt on ZnO, facilitated by the generation of surface V\nO\ns through photoirradiation (Extended Data \n), occurs similar to the deposition of Pt on TiO\n\n(Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n).\n\nmigration process.\nb\n,\nc\n, EPR spectra to investigate Pt deposition on photochemically generated defects in ZnO (\nb\n) and CeO\n\n(\nc\n).

The signals corresponding to Ce\n3+\n(\ng\n= 1.87, 1.92, 2.09 and 2.15), Ce\n3+\n–O\n−\n–Ce\n4+\nsurface defects (\ng\n= 1.96) and O\n2−\n(\ng\n= 2.03) appeared\n\n,\n\n. After photoirradiation, the Ce\n3+\n–O\n−\n–Ce\n4+\nsurface defect signal disappeared along with an increase in Ce\n3+\nsignals, indicating the formation of surface V\nO\ns on CeO\n\n. The addition of Pt precursor to photoirradiated CeO\n\ncan instantly reduce Ce\n3+\nsignals along with the deposition of Pt atoms. The restoration of surface V\nO\ns by air exposure confirmed that the defects were consumed by the deposition of Pt atoms on the surface \nand Extended Data \n).\nTogether with these observations, the atomic state of Pt and its uniform dispersity within the correspondingly prepared materials (Pt-DSA/ZnO and Pt-DSA/CeO\n\n) (as confirmed by Cs-STEM with EDS mapping ,f\n) as well as XPS and XRD analyses (Extended Data \n)) evince the operation of analogous photoinduced-defect-tuning mechanism for the synthesis of ADCs on these various supports. We also found that the same photochemical protocol generally works for the atomic deposition of Ir and Cu on TiO\n\n, ZnO and CeO\n\n–f\n\nand Extended Data \n), clearly manifesting its general applicability (Extended Data \n).\nThe conventional wet-impregnation method using hydrogenated supports cannot be expended to the deposition of metal atoms (Pt, Ir and Cu) on hydrogenated ZnO and CeO\n\n. Following reduction in a H\n\n/Ar atmosphere, the EPR signals associated with oxygen defects greatly diminished, and there was no decrease in surface defects on metal deposition. Moreover, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and XPS data revealed that the loading amounts of metal atoms were relatively low and the oxidation states of metals were randomly mixed due to non-specific interactions, in contrast to the DSA catalysts (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nprovide detailed explanations).\nPhotocatalytic applications\nWe next studied how the atomic state and specific metal–support interaction that our photoactivation process engendered affect the catalytic performance. As a model system, we selected Pt-DSA/TiO\n\nto investigate photocatalytic HER in the presence of methanol as a hole scavenger. The HER activity of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\nshowed almost 1:1 correlation with the loaded amount of Pt (0.25–0.70 wt%) ,b\n). In particular, the recorded activity translates to constant turnover frequency (TOF) values within 1.2–1.3 s\n−1\n\n), which supports the formation of homogeneous atomic Pt active sites across all the loading amounts. Furthermore, these TOF values are higher than any other reported TiO\n\n-based photocatalysts with a co-catalyst loading of more than 0.1 wt%. The Pt-DSA (0.7 wt%) catalyst, with a TOF of 1.27 s\n−1\n, produced H\n\nat a rate of 164 mmol g\n−1\nh\n−1\n, which is higher than the rates produced by other catalysts, including an atomic Pt catalyst on TiO\n\n(Pt-SA/TiO\n\n), Pt-SA/hydrogenated TiO\n\nsynthesized through a conventional wet-impregnation method, physisorbed Pt nanoparticles on TiO\n\n(Pt-NP/TiO\n\n) (Extended Data \n) and other recently reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts (Extended Data \n). This exceptional catalytic activity manifests the beneficial role of the specific interaction between Pt atom and TiO\n\nuniquely formulated by our photoinduced atomic deposition method. It is worth noting that the wet-impregnation method used to prepare Pt-SA/TiO\n\nand Pt-SA/hydrogenated TiO\n\nhas a limited ability to improve their catalytic performance due to low and inconsistent metal loading \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n)\n\n. Moreover, the stability of the catalysts synthesized by the wet-impregnation method was poor because Pt atoms are deposited on irreversible surface disorders through non-specific interactions. Additionally, increasing the loading amount through the physisorption of nanoparticles led to a decrease in TOF \n, inset), because it can lead to the agglomeration or change in the local coordination between the metal species and support. In contrast to these systems, our catalyst accommodates the optimized atomically dispersed Pt coordination sites as evinced by its excellent catalytic activity and stability \n), highlighting the critical role of photoactivation in facilitating desirable atomic deposition through the formulation of active and robust interfacial sites.\n\nat different Pt loading values.\nb\n, Photocatalytic HER activity of Pt-NP/TiO\n\nand Pt-DSA/TiO\n\nat different Pt loading values.\nc\n, HER TOF (s\n−1\n) of the catalysts shown in\nb\n.

Although the activity of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\nremained consistent throughout the experiments, the activity of Pt-SA/hydrogenated TiO\n\ndecreased by more than 15%. The reactions were conducted under a light intensity of 100 mW cm\n–2\n.\nSource data\nFull size image\nTo explore more practical possibilities of our Pt-DSA/TiO\n\ncatalyst, we conducted photocatalytic H\n\nproduction with the photoreforming reaction of PET, which is known to be an ideal solution for reducing plastic waste and producing valuable energy resources and chemicals\n\n,\n\n. When we compared the initial H\n\ngeneration activities of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n, Pt-SA/hydrogenated TiO\n\nand Pt-NP/TiO\n\ncatalysts in the presence of PET as a hole scavenger \n), the activity of Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n(2.14 mmol g\nsub\n−1\nh\n−1\n) was found to be almost two-fold higher than that of Pt-SA/hydrogenated TiO\n\nand Pt-NP/TiO\n\n. Furthermore, we conducted a long-term photoreforming test, which showed 98% substrate conversion after 40 h of reaction \n). The conversion was calculated based on the provided chemical reaction equations (Methods), and the generated hydrogen amounts agree with the stoichiometric amounts, which were calculated based on the consumed amounts of reactants measured by\n\nH nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra \nand Extended Data \n). Additionally, the NMR data show that the Pt-DSA/TiO\n\ncatalyst utilizes terephthalic acid (TPA) as a reactant, along with ethylene glycol (EG) \n), resulting in exceptionally high conversion in the photoreforming of PET \n). We note that the performance of Pt-DSA (2.14 mmol g\nsub\n−1\nh\n−1\nand 42.2 mmol g\nsub\n−1\nwith a conversion of 98% over 40 h) in PET reforming is one of the highest activities among all the reported catalysts (Extended Data \n), and closely approaches the required performance (4.00 mmol g\nsub\n−1\nh\n−1\n, 50% conversion per day) for practical-stage hydrogen production by photoreforming\n\n. Finally, a cyclic measurement was conducted on a larger scale to evaluate the practicality and durability of the catalyst. As shown in \n, the reaction produced 22.4 ml H\n\n(1 mmol H\n\n) after an 8 h reaction on a 100 ml scale.

We showed a mechanistic framework that light irradiation on reducible oxides under the photocatalytic HER condition engenders surface V\n\nO\ns as active sites that enable the selective coordination of metal atoms through specific interactions. The developed method was generally applied to various reducible oxides (TiO\n\n, ZnO and CeO\n\n) to formulate DSA catalysts with different transition metals (Pt, Ir and Cu). The utility of our synthesis method is further manifested by the optimized Pt atom catalyst on TiO\n(Pt-DSA/TiO\n\n), which exhibits unparalleled activity for photocatalytic H\n\nevolution as well as for the practical photoreforming of non-recyclable plastic—PET.\n\nMethods\nMaterials\nTiO\n\n(anatase, <25 nm, 99.70%, lot no.

Methanol (99.8%) was purchased from Samchun Chemical. PET powder was purchased from Goodfellow.\nComputational details\nDFT simulations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package v. 5.4.1 (\n) with pseudopotentials obtained using the projector augmented-wave method\n\n. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional\n\nwas employed for an exchange–correlation approximation. Kinetic-energy cutoff for a plane-wave basis set was 450 eV, and a Monkhorst–Pack 3 × 4 × 1\nk\n-grid was applied for a periodic slab model. The vacuum slab was set as 12 Å thick.\nAtom substitution energy\n\nwas calculated as\n$${E}^{{\\rm{f}}}({\\rm{Pt}}-{\\rm{DSA}}/{{\\rm{TiO}}}_{2})={E}_{{\\rm{tot}}}({\\rm{Pt}}-{\\rm{DSA}}/{{\\rm{TiO}}}_{2})-{E}_{{\\rm{tot}}}({{\\rm{TiO}}}_{2})+{\\mu }_{{\\rm{Ti}}}-{\\mu }_{{\\rm{Pt}}},$$\nwhere\nµ\nTi\n=\nE\n(Ti\nhcp\n) + Δ\nµ\nTi\nand\nµ\nPt\n=\nE\n(Pt\nfcc\n) + Δ\nµ\nPt\n. The total energies of metallic Ti and Pt, namely,\nE\n(Ti\nhcp\n) and\nE\n(Pt\nfcc\n), respectively, were referenced to the hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) Ti and face-centred cubic (fcc) Pt, respectively. Also, Δ\nµ\nTi\nand Δ\nµ\nPt\nstand for the difference in chemical potentials of Ti and Pt from their reference states, assuming the following Ti\n4+\n(anatase TiO\n\n) and Pt\n4+\n(PtO\n\n) states:\n$$\\Delta {\\mu }_{{\\rm{Ti}}}+2\\Delta {\\mu }_{{\\rm{O}}}=\\Delta {H}_{{\\rm{f}}}({{\\rm{TiO}}}_{2}),$$\n$$\\Delta {\\mu }_{{\\rm{Pt}}}+2\\Delta {\\mu }_{{\\rm{O}}}=\\Delta {H}_{{\\rm{f}}}({{\\rm{PtO}}}_{2}),$$\nwhere Δ\nµ\nO\n= 0 under O-rich conditions as referenced to an O\n\nmolecule, Δ\nµ\nTi\n= Δ\nH\nf\n(TiO\n\n) = –9.23 eV and Δ\nµ\nPt\n= –1.52 eV.\nFor comparison, the Pt cohesion energy was calculated with respect to the precursor state, namely, Pt\n4+\n. The Pt cohesion energy is defined as\n$$E({{\\rm{Pt}}}_{{\\rm{fcc}}})={E}_{{\\rm{tot}}}({{\\rm{Pt}}}_{{\\rm{fcc}}})-{\\mu }_{{\\rm{Pt}}},$$\nwhere Δ\nµ\nPt\nis referenced to atomic Pt for Pt cohesion from Pt atoms and to the Pt\n4+\nstate under O-rich conditions.\n$$\\Delta {\\mu }_{{\\rm{Pt}}}=\\Delta {H}_{{\\rm{f}}}({{\\rm{Pt}}}_{{\\rm{atom}}})=\\Delta {H}_{{\\rm{at}}}({{\\rm{Pt}}}_{{\\rm{fcc}}})({\\rm{cohesion}}\\,{\\rm{from}}\\,{\\rm{Pt}}\\,{\\rm{atom}})$$\n$$\\Delta {\\mu }_{{\\rm{Pt}}}+2\\Delta {\\mu }_{{\\rm{O}}}=\\Delta {H}_{{\\rm{f}}}({{\\rm{PtO}}}_{2})({\\rm{cohesion}}\\,{\\rm{from}}\\,{\\rm{Pt}}^{4+}\\,{\\text{under O}}^{-}{\\text{-rich conditions}})$$\nTherefore,\nE\n(Pt\nfcc\n) = –Δ\nH\nat\n(Pt\nfcc\n) = –5.85 eV for Pt cohesion from atomic Pt\n\n, whereas\nE\n(Pt\nfcc\n) = –[Δ\nH\nf\n(PtO\n\n) – 2Δ\nµ\nO\n] = +1.52 eV for Pt cohesion from ionic Pt\n4+\n\n, last step).\n\nSynthesis of Pt-DSA/TiO\nHere 50 mg of commercial anatase TiO\n\nwas dispersed in 10 ml of 20% methanol aqueous solution in a 20 ml gas-tight vial under sonication for 10 min. A fixed amount of H\n\nPtCl\n\n(50.0, 37.5, 25.0 and 12.5 μl for Pt-DSA and 0.70, 0.60, 0.50 and 0.25 wt% TiO\n\n, respectively) are diluted with H\n\nO to make 1 ml of aqueous Pt precursor solutions. The TiO\n\ndispersion and Pt precursor solution were purged with Ar gas for 10 min. The TiO\n\ndispersion was vigorously stirred and simultaneously irradiated with UV–vis light at an intensity of 100 mW cm\n–2\nusing a xenon lamp light source (Newport). The light was irradiated for 20 min for each sample. After the TiO\n\ndispersion turned bluish, 0.5 ml of the Pt precursor solution was injected into the TiO\n\ndispersion and vigorously stirred. After 10 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol. The product was dried in an electric oven at 50 °C overnight and used for photocatalytic reactions and/or characterizations.\n\nSynthesis of Pt-SA/hydrogenated TiO\n\nThe commercial anatase TiO\n\nwas reduced at 500 °C in a 10% H\n\n/Ar atmosphere for 1 h. Then, 50 mg of the as-synthesized hydrogenated TiO\n\nwas dispersed in 10 ml of H\n\nO in a 20 ml vial under sonication for 10 min. Furthermore, 50 μl of H\n\nPtCl\n\nwas diluted with H\n\nO to make 1.0 ml of an aqueous Pt precursor solution; 0.5 ml of the Pt precursor solution was injected into the TiO\n\ndispersion and vigorously stirred. After 10 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol.

Pt precursor solutions were prepared according to the same procedure as described in the Pt-DSA/TiO\n\npart above. The Pt precursor solution was purged with Ar gas for 10 min; 0.5 ml of the Pt precursor solution was injected into the TiO\n\ndispersion and vigorously stirred. After 20 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol. The product was dried in an electric oven at 50 °C overnight and used for the photocatalytic HER reaction.\n\nSynthesis of Pt-NP/TiO\n\nPt precursor solutions were made using a definite amount of H\n\nPtCl\n\n(17.50, 15.00, 12.50 and 6.25 μl for Pt-NPs and 0.70, 0.60, 0.50 and 0.25 wt% for TiO\n\n, respectively). Then, 0.5 ml of the Pt precursor solution was added into 10.0 ml of 20% methanol aqueous solution in a 20.0 ml gas-tight vial. The solution was purged with Ar gas for 10 min and irradiated with UV–vis light at an intensity of 100 mW cm\n–2\nand vigorously stirred. After 1 h of irradiation, the reaction solution was centrifuged and the precipitation was dissolved in 2 ml H\n\nO. The resulting Pt-NP solution was mixed with 8 ml of aqueous TiO\n\ndispersion, which contained 50 mg of commercial TiO\n\n. After 20 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol. The product was dried in an electric oven at 50 °C overnight and used for photocatalytic reactions and/or characterizations.\n\nSynthesis of Ir- and Cu-DSA/TiO\nIn the case of Ir- and Cu-DSA/TiO\n\n, basic synthesis procedures were similar to the method used for Pt-DSA/TiO\n. The only different step was that definite amounts of H\n\nIrCl\n\n(2.2 mg) and CuCl\n\n(5.4 mg) were added into 1 ml of H\n\nO to make the Ir and Cu precursor solutions, respectively. The Ir and Cu precursor solutions were used instead of the Pt precursor solution to synthesize Ir- and Cu-DSA/TiO\n\n, respectively.\n\nSynthesis of M(Pt, Ir, Cu)-DSA/(ZnO, CeO\n)\n\nBasic synthesis procedures were similar to the method of metal-dynamically stabilized atom/TiO\n.

Extended XAFS (EXAFS) Fourier transforms (FTs) are shown in \n. SA-Rh/CN exhibits a major peak at ~1.48 Å, which is shorter than the Rh–N peak at ~1.54 Å for the RhN\n\noctahedra in [Rh(N\n\nH\n\n)\n\n]Cl\n\nand slightly larger than the Rh–O peak at ~1.45 Å for the RhO\n\noctahedra in Rh(acac)\n\n; this can thus be attributed to a mixture of Rh–N and Rh–O bonding. In addition, FT of SA-Rh/CN reveals a minor signal at ~2.09 Å that is much shorter than the Rh–Rh peak at ~2.38 Å for Rh bulk, which indicates atomic dispersion of the Rh species. To more clearly discriminate the coordination atoms in the Rh species, EXAFS wavelet transform analysis was carried out \n)\n\n. With no intensity maximum at ~8.5 Å\n−1\n, only one intensity maximum at ~4.0 Å\n−1\nis detected in SA-Rh/CN, not only confirming that the Rh metals exist as mononuclear centres without the presence of metal-derived crystalline structures in SA-Rh/CN, but also validating the assignment of the major peak at ~1.48 Å to Rh–N/O bonding \n). Subsequently, least-squares EXAFS curve-fitting analysis was used to extract quantitative structural results for the Rh moiety in SA-Rh/CN \n, Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary \n). The coordination number of the N/O atoms in the first coordination sphere of Rh was estimated to be 6.3 at distance of 2.05 Å, indicating an octahedral configuration for the Rh–N/O bonding. Meanwhile, a second coordination sphere of C atoms was shown at 2.78 Å with a coordination number of 3.6. This is in marked contrast to the porphyrinic-N-based moiety, where the number of C atoms in the second coordination sphere is expected to be larger than 10 but is similar to the pyridinic-N-based and MN\n\nC\n\nmoieties\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, which has a higher sensitivity to the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of atoms around the photo-absorber, was applied to better identify the atomic-site structures. The Rh K-edge XANES spectrum of SA-Rh/CN is shown in \n; the profile is similar to the [Rh(N\n\nH\n\n)\n\n]Cl\n\nand Rh(acac)\n\nreferences, but the pre-edge peak intensity, which is directly proportional to the coordination deviation of the photo-absorber from centrosymmetry\n\n, demonstrates an obvious increase as compared to [Rh(N\n\nH\n\n)\n\n]Cl\n\nand Rh(acac)\n\n. These results suggest that Rh atoms in SA-Rh/CN adopt a distorted octahedral coordination\n\n, which is in agreement with the EXAFS results. The absorption edge position of Rh (the position at half the edge step height) is comparable to that of [Rh(N\n\nH\n\n)\n\n]Cl\n\nand Rh(acac)\n\n, indicating that the Rh valence state is close to +3, consistent with the results obtained from XPS spectra. A variety of structure models were established by DFT calculations to identify the specific structure of SA-Rh/CN via a comparison of the simulated XANES spectra of the model Rh-N\nx\nmoieties with the experimental spectrum. We found that the XANES profile of SA-Rh/CN can be reproduced fairly well by the structure of a Rh-N\n\nmoiety embedded in a minimized graphene sheet with two axial oxygen molecules \n), and the interatomic distances predicted by DFT are fully consistent with the structural parameters determined by EXAFS fitting (Supplementary \n). However, some obvious discrepancies are presented when the Rh-N\n\nmoiety is embedded in an extended graphene sheet (Supplementary \n). Therefore, the combination of EXAFS and XANES analyses has unambiguously revealed the mononuclear dispersion of the Rh species in a largely defective graphene sheet in SA-Rh/CN, which is also consistent with Raman spectra.\n\n, Wavelet transforms for the\nk\n\n-weighted EXAFS signals of SA-Rh/CN and reference samples.

Notably, SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN (synthesized by the same procedure; for characterizations see Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary \n) are inert towards FOR. In cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves obtained under the same conditions as used for SA-Rh/CN, we can only see the signal of the electrical double layer (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Moreover, the mass activity of SA-Rh/CN is sevenfold higher than that of Pd/C at 0.25 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE); with increasing potential, this mass activity increases to up to 46-fold higher than for Pd/C (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand Supplementary \n). The turnover frequency (TOF) of SA-Rh/CN (8.55 s\n−1\n) is nine times higher than that of Pd/C (0.92 s\n−1\n; Supplementary \n). To explore the reasons for the lower current in the negative scan, we changed the scan range of the CV test (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). The results, combined with in situ XANES spectra (Supplementary \n), suggest that the oxidation state of the Rh atoms becomes higher and can be attributed to the formation of oxides during the reaction at high potentials. However, during scans under standard conditions, SA-Rh/CN recovers in the anodic scan of the second cycle (Supplementary \n), suggesting that the oxidation species has recovered to its initial state.\n\nSO\n\naqueous solution (0.5 M) containing HCOOH (0.5 M), with a scan rate of 10 mV s\n−1\n.\nb\n, Peak mass activity of SA-Rh/CN, Pt/C, Pd/C and Rh/C.\nc\n, Mass activity after specific times (in seconds) of a CA test of SA-Rh/CN and Pd/C at peak potential.\nd\n, Steady-state polarization and power density curves for SA-Rh/CN for DFAFC with formic acid (3 M) at different temperatures.

The CV curve of SA-Rh/CN is almost unchanged after 50,000 s of the CA test (Supplementary \n). With ADT, the CVs after the first 20,000 cycles show the excellent durability of SA-Rh/CN (44.4 h, almost unchanged; Supplementary \n). In the next 10,000 cycles, SA-Rh/CN loses only 11% of its mass activity (66.7 h; 14.3 A mg\n−1\n). By contrast, commercial Pd/C suffers a huge loss of 72% after the first 1,000 s of the CA test and is almost deactivated after 1,500 cycles (3 h) of ADT \nand Supplementary Figs.\n42b\nand\n43b\n). The CA curves for different rotation rates of SA-Rh/CN are almost identical, indicating that there is less mass transfer effect in FOR (Supplementary \n). Characterizations of SA-Rh/CN after the CA test (denoted SA-Rh/CN-af) indicate that SA-Rh/CN has maintained its rhombic dodecahedron morphology and the Rh atoms have retained their atomic distributions (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n).\nZn plays a vital role in the formation of SA-Rh/CN: first, tetrahedral coordinated Zn ions bridged by 2-methylimidazole constitute the skeleton of ZIF-8; second, during pyrolysis, Zn ion sites are substituted by Rh atoms to form SA-Rh/CN. We detected 6.82 wt% Zn in SA-Rh/CN, which is a huge amount—seven times higher than the metal loading of Rh, which is determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (detailed ICP-OES measurements are provided in the\nSupplementary\nInformation). To explore the role of Zn in SA-Rh/CN, a series of control experiments were carried out. First, we extracted Rh atoms from SA-Rh/CN (to give CN) and prepared ZIF-8-derived CN (namely ZIF-8-C; characterizations are shown in Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). From CV curves of these two samples and ZIF-8, we observed that these samples are inert to FOR (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). These results indicate that the Rh atoms play a key role in FOR. Subsequently, Rh/ZIF-8 with different pyrolysed conditions was prepared (‘Rh/CN-different conditions’; for details see\n\nMethods\n). The amount of Zn in these samples decreased from 12.47 wt% to 0.28 wt%, because the Zn vaporized under the high temperatures (Supplementary \n). Characterizations of these samples are provided in Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary \n. With vaporization of the Zn, the multi-point BET surface of Rh/CN increased from 790 to 1,339 m\n\ng\n−1\nand the micropore volume of the Rh/CN increased from 0.310 to 0.550 cm\n\ng\n−1\n. The other characterizations show no obvious differences. The mass activity of Rh/CN-2h (11.6 A mg\n−1\n) is much weaker than that of SA-Rh/CN (16.1 A mg\n−1\n). The mass activities of Rh/CN-4h (16.3 A mg\n−1\n), Rh/CN-5h (17.0 A mg\n−1\n) and Rh/CN-1100 (17.4 A mg\n−1\n) only exhibit a slight improvement (Supplementary \n). These results suggest that excessive Zn in Rh/CN blocks the micropores in Rh/CN and thus has a negative effect on the catalytic properties and a small amount of Zn has negligible effect on catalytic performance.\nTo evaluate the potential applications of SA-Rh/CN as an anode catalyst in DFAFCs, an integral fuel cell incorporated with SA-Rh/CN was assembled. SA-Rh/CN shows a high mass power density (522.1 mW mg\n−1\n; \n), which is 8.8-fold higher than that of commercial Pd/C at 30 °C (59.3 mW mg\n−1\n; Supplementary \n). SA-Rh/CN also displays high power densities of 1,086.9 and 1,241.9 mW mg\n−1\nat 60 °C and 80 °C, which are 14.8 and 14.1 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C (73.4 and 87.9 mW mg\n−1\nrespectively). The fuel cell performances at a fixed dimension of SA-Rh/CN and Pd/C show that the power density of SA-Rh/CN is lower than that of Pd/C (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), because the amount of precious metal in commercial Pd (30 wt%) is over 30 times higher than that in SA-Rh/CN (0.92 wt%). It is important to increase the metal loading of precious metal in SA-Rh/CN. Accordingly, a single cell test with Rh/CN-1100 (1.42 wt%) as anodic catalyst was performed. The power density of DFAFCs increases strikingly at 80 °C to 86.6 mW cm\n−2\n, which is approaching that of Pd/C (105.4 mW cm\n−2\n), although the metal loading of Pd/C is still 21.4 times higher than that of Rh/CN-1100 (Supplementary \n). Therefore, it is believed that single-atom Rh catalysts show tremendous potential in DFAFCs.\nTo explore the CO resistance of SA-Rh/CN, two different CO-stripping experiments were performed. ,b\npresents CO resistance against saturated CO (for detailed procedures see\n\nMethods\n). With Rh/C, the oxidation of adsorbed CO (CO*) appears at 0.67 V with a steep peak, which is in agreement with previously reported work. To our surprise, SA-Rh/CN can oxidize CO* at a very low potential (0.08 V) with a tiny peak, which suggests that CO weakly adsorbs at the surface of SA-Rh/CN and can be oxidized easily. ,d\nshows the CO resistance in a simulated cell arrangement (for detailed procedures see\n\nMethods\n). As for the curve for Rh/C, the CO* oxidation peak emerges at 0.63 V. However, no peak appears on the curve for SA-Rh/CN. These results indicate that SA-Rh/CN can inhibit the dehydration of formic acid, eliminating CO poisoning in DFAFCs and oxidizing formic acid towards direct dehydrogenation.\n\n, SA-Rh/CN (\na\n) and Rh/C (\nb\n) modified glassy carbon electrodes were introduced into a 0.5 M H\n\nSO\n\nCO-saturated aqueous solution and kept at −0.4 V for 15 min, then N\n\nwas purged into the solution and CV curves were acquired. The scan rate was 50 mV s\n−1\nand the electrode diameters were 5 mm.\nc\n,\nd\n, SA-Rh/CN (\nc\n) and Rh/C (\nd\n) modified glassy carbon electrodes were immersed into a 0.5 M H\n\nSO\n\nand 0.5 M HCOOH aqueous solution for 5 min at open-circuit potential (OCP), washed with deionized water and placed in a 0.5 M H\n\nSO\n\naqueous N\n\n-saturated solution, then the CVs were recorded. The scan rate was 10 mV s\n−1\nand the electrode diameters were 3 mm.\nFull size image\nA series of experiments were carried out to explore the reaction mechanism. The Tafel slope (108 mV dec\n−1\n) of SA-Rh/CN indicates that C–H bond cleavage of HCOOH is the rate-determining step (Supplementary \n)\n\n. When we use DCOOH instead of HCOOH in electrolyte, the mass activity of SA-Rh/CN shows a huge drop to 9.8 A mg\n−1\n, confirming the results of the Tafel slope analysis (Supplementary \n)\n\n. No signals of intermediates are observed in in situ Fourier-transform infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (in situ FTIR) and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR; Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n).\nDFT calculations\nDFT calculations were carried out to further understand the mechanism of formic acid oxidation on SA-Rh/CN and its excellent CO tolerance. In \nand Supplementary \n, the free energy profiles of formic acid oxidation demonstrate that the indirect route is thermodynamically unfavourable, as an endothermic reaction energy of 0.28 eV is needed to produce the CO* and H\n\nO\n(aq)\n. Cleavage of the C–O bond in HCOOH is difficult at the SA-Rh site, because a larger surface ensemble site is required\n\n. In the formate route, two successive steps, HCOOH\n(aq)\n→ HCOO* → CO\n2(g)\n, are both thermodynamically favourable. The O–H bond in formic acid can be broken easily (Supplementary \n) in water solution\n\n,\n\n, and C–H cleavage of HCOO* with an activation energy of 0.68 eV is the rate-determining step (Supplementary \n), which is in good agreement with the results of Tafel slope analysis and kinetic isotope effects. As for the direct routes, the intermediate, COOH*, forms four hydrogen bonds with nearby water molecules, and its O–H bond is almost broken with a length of 1.63 Å. Although the formation of CO\n2(g)\nfrom COOH* is an endothermic step, it can be thermodynamically favourable at higher potential (\nU\nRHE\n> 0.54 V; Supplementary \n). The rate-determining step is still the cleavage of the C–H bond of formic acid, with an activation barrier of 0.76 eV (Supplementary \n), which is higher than that of the C–H bond cleavage in the formate route. Overall, the formate route is more favourable than the direct route considering both thermodynamics and kinetics, especially at low potential. At high potential, the direct route can also be favourable in terms of thermodynamics.\n\n, Top: potential energy profiles of formic acid decomposition to CO on the SA-Rh site (red curve) and the Rh surface (black curve). Bottom: corresponding structures of the intermediates and transition states (TSs). The zero energy reference is the sum energy of formic acid molecules in the gas phase and corresponding clean surfaces. Zero-point energy corrections are included. White, grey, blue, red and orange balls represent H, C, N, O and Rh atoms, respectively.\nFull size image\nTo elucidate the excellent CO tolerance of SA-Rh/CN, formic acid decomposition to produce CO and the binding of CO were analysed and compared with a Rh nanoparticle. In \n, formic acid can adsorb on Rh through the carbonyl oxygen atom, with a large exothermic energy of −0.85 eV, whereas the HCOOH can only weakly adsorb on the SA-Rh site with an adsorption energy of −0.25 eV. The weak adsorption of formic acid at the SA-Rh site can be attributed to the downward shift of the\nd\norbital below the Fermi level and the density of state (DOS) at the Fermi level being less than that on Rh (for more details see Supplementary \n). Importantly, the subsequent decomposition of HCOOH to produce CO on Rh occurs readily, with an activation barrier of only 0.52 eV. Meanwhile, on the SA-Rh site, the activation barrier to produce CO is as high as 1.68 eV and the reaction energy is endothermic by 1.08 eV, indicating that CO is difficult to generate on SA-Rh sites. On the other hand, CO binds much more strongly on Rh (\nE\nads\n(CO) = −2.21 eV) than on SA-Rh sites (\nE\nads\n(CO) = −0.99 eV), implying that the removal of CO on SA-Rh/CN, as long as it is produced, can be easily achieved compared with the Rh nanoparticle. Hence, the high barrier to produce CO and the relatively unfavourable binding with CO contribute to the excellent CO tolerance of SA-Rh/CN.\nDFT calculations were also performed to explore the reactivity of SA-Rh/CN and the inertness of SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN. The DOS of a single Pd atom at the Fermi level is almost zero, and the closest occupied peak is ~1.5 eV below the Fermi level, suggesting the chemical inertness of the SA-Pd site (Supplementary \n). The adsorption energy of CO at the SA-Pd site is extremely small (\nE\nads\n(CO) = −0.13 eV), indicating the weak bonding with other intermediates in formic acid oxidation. The single Pt atom is similar to the single Pd atom in the DOS and adsorption of CO. Overall, the SA-Rh sites possess appropriate binding ability with intermediates, indicated by\nE\nads\n(CO) = −0.99 eV, and thus better overall activity, while the Rh surface binds intermediates too strongly, as indicated by\nE\nads\n(CO) = −2.21 eV, and both the SA-Pd and SA-Pt sites bind intermediates too weakly, indicated by\nE\nads\n(CO) = −0.13 eV.\nConclusions\nIn summary, we report a new type of electrocatalyst for FOR, namely isolated single-atom Rh anchored on N-doped carbon. This catalyst has properties that are completely different from those of its nanoparticle counterpart (Rh nanoparticles/C shows negligible activity toward formic acid oxidation). The SA-Rh/CN electrocatalyst exhibits excellent mass activity, 28- and 67-fold higher than that of state-of-the-art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively, but also high catalytic stability due to its excellent tolerance to CO poisoning and resistance to sinter. The single-cell test indicates its application potential in DFAFCs. The mechanism of formic acid oxidation on SA-Rh and its unique CO tolerance have been demonstrated by DFT calculations. This work suggests a possible direction for the development of new electrocatalysts.\n\nMethods\nChemicals\nRh(acac)\n\n, Zn(NO\n\n)\n\n, 2-methylimidazole, Nafion solution (5% wt/wt), palladium on activated carbon (Pd/C), platinum on activated carbon (Pt/C), Rh powder and [Rh(N\n\nH\n\n)\n\n]Cl\n\nwere purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co.

The main reason is that single atoms are only distributed on the surface of GNPs because of atomization by top-down abrasion. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Supplementary \n) confirmed the existence of iron.\nPowder X-ray diffraction patterns (Supplementary \n) indicated that there were no peaks from particulate iron in all samples. Only the graphite and facets were present. However, clusters and/or amorphous iron phases cannot be detected by X-ray diffraction, and therefore we employed low-resolution HADDF-STEM (Supplementary \n) to confirm that there were no visible iron particles on the surface of the GNPs.\nThe characteristics of the single atoms were verified by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The radial distribution function (RDF) derived from EXAFS results is shown in \n. The main bonding of the original sample located at around 1.5 Å (refs.\n\n,\n\n,\n\n) is attributed to Fe–N/C. There is a small shoulder at 2.2 Å that corresponds to Fe–Fe bonding. This indicates that very small amounts of iron carbide clusters may be present in the sample. After carefully checking tens of HAADF-STEM images (Supplementary \n), the clusters were found to have a typical size of less than 1 nm.\nThe chemical state of the sample was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary ,b\n). However, the Fe 2\np\nsignal did not provide any valuable information due to poor resolution. The Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) results confirmed that the chemical state of iron was a mixture of Fe\nII\nand Fe\nIII\n(Supplementary \n).\nWe also performed Mössbauer spectroscopy, one of the most powerful techniques for characterizing iron with ultrahigh sensitivity \nand Supplementary \n). The Mössbauer spectroscopy deconvolution results indicated that the doublets D1, D2 and D3 can be attributed to low-, intermediate- and high-spin Fe\nII\nN\n\n(31%), respectively\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. The doublets D4 and D5 can be attributed to low- and intermediate-spin Fe\nIII\nN\n\n(44%)\n\n. The results indicated that after abrasion the single atoms constituted approximately 75% of the original sample, and the clusters were identified as a short-range-ordered Fe\n\nC (sextet S1, 25%).\nRole of heat treatment on Fe–N–C SAC\nWe have found that additional heat treatment can be beneficial for improving thermal stability and increasing the fraction of SACs by transforming the occasionally formed metal clusters into single atoms. After heat treatment, the absence of iron-related peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern (Supplementary \n) indicates that the iron atoms still maintain the single-atom state and no aggregation occurs. The disappearance of the shoulder in the RDF \n) implies that the Fe\n\nC clusters have been transformed into single atoms. This phenomenon of heating bulk metal into single atoms is consistent with recently reported works\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Careful analysis of the Mössbauer spectroscopy \nand Supplementary \n) indicates only 4% untransformed clusters, which correspond to Fe\n\nC (the minor sextet S1) after phase transition. In addition to S1, the doublets D1 and D5 also decrease; however, the doublets D2, D3 and D4 increase. These changes are thought to be intimately related to the transformations and ordering arrangements after heat treatment.\nThe chemical state is also slightly altered due to the heat treatment. The XPS and XANES (Supplementary , c\n) shift to higher energy due to the transformation from Fe\n\nC to single atoms. It is interesting to find that the atomic images of the samples after heat treatment are always clearer than those without heat treatment (Supplementary \n). This phenomenon may be associated with easily adsorbing gas molecules of the samples without heat treatment.\nAbrasion kinetics\nThe content and morphology of the iron can be facilely tuned by changing the input kinetic energy, graphite loading and ball-milling time. After dozens of experiments, some general rules were determined. It was established that the input kinetic energy and loading of graphite mainly influence the morphology of the iron. Lower input kinetic energy (using smaller iron balls and lower rotation speeds) and higher graphite loading are beneficial to the single-atom state. The ball-milling time mainly determines iron loading, but does not influence the morphology of the iron unless a critical value of loading is exceeded.\nA mathematical analysis (Supplementary –c\n) determined that the iron content (\nW\n) in Fe–N–C is proportional to the cube of the input kinetic energy, that is,\nW\n∝\n(\nmω\n\n)\n\n, where\nm\nand\nω\nstand for mass and rotation speed, respectively. Graphite loading (\nL\n) can also influence\nW\nbecause graphite acts as a lubricant, which can reduce abrasion.\nW\nexponentially decreases as\nL\nincreases (\nW\n∝\ne\n−\nL\n) (Supplementary ,e\n).\nW\nincreases when the ball-milling time is prolonged, but the effect is not linear. Possible reasons are that\nW\nis influenced by nitrogen content and the state of the graphite (Supplementary \n).\nExtension to cobalt, nickel, copper and brass\nWe also extend our method to other metals (Supplementary \n), which are not limited to cobalt, nickel and copper. All metals that can form a stable bond with supports should work. As shown in \n, Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n, the RDFs demonstrate that cobalt, nickel and copper exist in the single-atom state. Their morphologies are shown in Supplementary \n, further confirming the single-atom state.\nIn addition to unary metal balls, alloy balls can also be used to fabricate bimetallic catalysts. We selected brass balls (66 wt% Cu + 34 wt% Zn) as an example (Supplementary ,b\n). HAADF-STEM images (Supplementary ,d\n) demonstrate the brass alloy has been transformed into single atoms. RDFs \nand Supplementary ,f\n) further verify that the copper and zinc exist in single-atom states.\nTheoretical analysis\nIn the samples without nitrogen, the N\n\ngas simply acts as a protective gas to prevent oxidation. However, the N\n\nplays an important role when the support is nitrogen-free graphite. We next designed a control experiment to investigate the role of N\n\n. Using samples with a similar iron loading (2.4 wt%), we replaced N\n\nwith argon. The as-prepared Fe–C displayed a distinctly different morphology. The GNPs were fully decorated with small iron particles with a size of approximately 10 nm (Supplementary \n). This result indicates that the nitrogen in the GNPs plays a pivotal role in the morphology of the prepared iron. The nitrogen might suppress the aggregation of single iron atoms into particles.\nThe underlying physical nature of why single-atom iron is formed during the ball-milling process, and why the iron particles can be transformed into single atoms, has remained unclear. To unravel these questions, a DFT analysis was conducted (Supplementary \n). It is known that repeated collisions of iron balls transform mechanical energy into structural disordering and induce surface defects\n\n. The activated iron surface not only acts as a catalyst for nitrogen dissociation\n\n, but also supplies iron to form the Fe–N–C. Compared with other metals, the adatoms on the iron balls are easily peeled off by the nitrogen-doped GNPs because of the high segregation energy (Δ\nE\nseg\n, −4.3 eV, \n) due to the strong Fe–N bond. The α-Fe (Supplementary \n) and Fe\n\nC (Supplementary \n) particles are also capable of transforming into single-atom states due to exothermic processes with Δ\nE\nseg\nof −3.3 eV and −2.8 eV, respectively. The transformed iron atoms migrate away from the defects by a hopping mechanism\n\n,\n\n. The nitrogen atoms play a pivotal role by subsequently trapping the iron atoms. When the nitrogen atoms are lost at high temperature, the surface energy will dominate again and the iron particles will reform.\n\n, Theoretical analysis of the transformation of bulk iron into a single-atom model. The indicator is segregation energy (Δ\nE\nseg\n), which corresponds to the energy involved when N–C moieties capture iron atoms. Negative energy indicates released energy.\nFull size image\nConclusions\nWe report a facile, solvent-free, zero-waste and low-cost method to prepare SACs. As-prepared single-atom metal–N–C catalysts showed competitive oxygen reduction reaction performance relative to commercial Pt@C (Supplementary \n). Our strategy is not only applicable for metal–N–C systems (in which the metal can be iron, cobalt, nickel, copper or their alloys), but can also be easily extended to other supports. To demonstrate this, we also successfully synthesized SACs on some typical supports used in heterogeneous catalysis, such as oxides (MgO, SiO\n\nand CeO\n\n; –d\nand Supplementary \n–\n\n) and nitrides (C\n\nN\n\n; ,f\nand Supplementary \n).

After 5 min of vigorous stirring, the mixture was\nkept at room temperature for 24 h to complete the polymerization process. The formed polyaniline was\nthoroughly washed with deionized water for neutralization, dried in vacuum at 393 K for 12 h, and\nafterwards calcined at 1073 K (heating rate 5 K min−1, hold time 1 h, static N ). The obtained N-doped\n\ncarbon was ground and sieved (particle size 0.4-0.6 mm). Commercial activated carbon (AC, Norit ROX\n0.8) was immersed in aqua regia at room temperature to remove metal impurities. After filtration and\n\nthorough washing with deionized water (750 cm3 g−1), the material was dried in static air at 393 K for 12 h\nand subsequently ground and sieved into 0.4-0.6 mm particles.\nAll metal-based catalysts were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method with a nominal\nmetal loading of 1 wt.%.

By combining currently available state-of-the-art characterization techniques to\nanalyse metal nuclearity and speciation in powder catalysts, including aberration corrected high-angle\nannular dark-field (AC-HAADF) STEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), XAS, XPS, and DFT the evolution of\nthe metal site as a function of the choice of metal, the thermal activation temperature, and the\nfunctionalization of the carbon support, was assessed. At T = 473 K, all metals are exclusively present as\nact\nsingle atoms, as visualized by STEM analysis , Supplementary Figs. 1, 2) and corroborated by\nthe absence of respective metal reflections in the XRD patterns (Supplementary . XPS and\nextended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results indicate a positively charged metal center\nwith ca. 2-4 chlorine neighboring atoms and the absence of metal-metal fingerprints in all cases ,\nSupplementary Figs. 4-9, Supplementary Tables 2-5). Notably, the partially or fully chlorinated state of\nthe metals largely impairs their ability to adsorb common probe molecules, such as carbon monoxide, thus\ndisqualifying probe molecule vibrational spectroscopy as a tool to further characterize the SACs reported\nin this work. Despite the common initial speciation patterns (i.e., isolated atoms), an increase in the\nthermal activation temperature triggers distinct behaviors for all metals, depending on the choice of carbon\nhost. On AC, the population of metal chloride single atoms is systematically decreased with rising\ntemperature due to gradual agglomeration into nanoparticles with small average particle sizes for Pt, Ru,\n\nRh, and Ir (d = 3-5 nm at T = 1073 K) and larger sizes for Au and Pd (d = 7.1 nm for Au at\np act p\nT = 523 K and d = 11.3 nm for Pd at T = 673 K, Supplementary . Based on XPS and EXAFS\nact p act\nanalyses, the nature of the obtained nanoparticles was identified as mainly metallic, in the case of Au, Pt,\nand Pd, and oxidic for Ru, Rh, and Ir. Notably, on NC, the former group does not undergo agglomeration\nwith increasing thermal activation up to 1073 K. Instead, a gradual change in the coordination\nenvironment from predominantly M-Cl single atoms to M-N single atoms occurs (i.e., coordinated to 4\nx 4\nnitrogen neighboring atoms). On the contrary, the agglomeration behavior of Ru, Rh, and Ir is hardly\naffected by the choice of the carbon host and small metal oxide particles are formed with increasing\nactivation temperature.\n\nTo rationalize the transformation of the metal speciation in the M/C catalysts during the catalyst synthesis,\nthree aspects were considered: (i) the metal cohesive energy, E , indicating the stability of the bulk\n\ncoh\nmetal, (ii) the metal oxide formation energy, E (M-oxide), describing the stability of the metal oxide,\nform\nand (iii) the single-atom formation energies in their most stable configurations in chlorinated and non-\nchlorinated form, E (MCl) and E (SA), quantifying the interaction strength of single atoms to the\nform form\nsurface defects of the carbon (N-defects on NC and O-defects on AC, respectively). Considering the\nformer two, it is evident that E and E (M-oxide) are linearly dependent . This implies that the\ncoh form\norigin of the diverging behavior of the Au (Au, Pt, Pd) and Ru (Ru, Rh, Ir) groups regarding their\npreferred formation of metallic or oxidic nanoparticles relates to their ability to form stable oxides. To\nassess the impact of the metal-host interactions in the M/C catalysts, DFT was employed. The model for\nthe AC and NC supports was constructed from 16 distinct defects containing either N (pyrrolic, pyridinic,\ngraphitic, oxo-pyridinic) or O (hydroxyl, epoxide, keto) heteroatoms (Supplementary , see\nComputational Methods for details) leading to 280 metal-carbon configurations. This thorough speciation\nanalysis is based on stability of the single atoms, chlorinated single atoms, bulk metals and metal oxides\n(that identify thermodynamically stable configurations, Supplementary -15) coupled to matching\nthe experimental characterization fingerprints, EXAFS (narrowing further the set of most likely models,\nSupplementary . Considering this extensive number of sites offering diverse coordination motifs,\n\nthe interactions of a single-metal atom (MCl species) vary widely depending on the specific AC or NC\ndefect , Supplementary . Remarkably, also the extent of this interaction, as averaged\n(arithmetic mean) formation energies of the non-chlorinated single atom M-SA and chlorinated\nMCl species, correlates with the metal oxide phase. Overall, this observation indicates a (linear)\ndependence between the metal, metal oxide, and metal SA (MCl) stability. Thereby, the metal oxide\nformation energy plays the key role in directing the speciation behavior. For example, on a representative\nbi-epoxidic AC defect, the stability of the SA species (with reference to the metal bulk) is sufficient to\novercome the cohesive energy of all metals, if Cl is present in the coordination sphere (T = 473 K).\nact\nUpon increasing the activation temperature, the Cl content decreases, leading to the formation of less\nstable Cl-undercoordinated SA species. For Ru in the two epoxidic defects described above this leads to\nMO species attached to the surface via van der Waals (vdW) forces. These are then mobile and\n\nagglomerate into larger metal oxide particles. The stability of the Au group is also compromised by Cl\nremoval. However, in contrast to the Ru group, the formation of MO species is not favorable, thus\n\nleaving the epoxidic defect intact and promoting sintering of the Au group .\n\n(II) Catalyst Preparation\nThe N-doped carbon support (NC) was prepared in a two-step synthesis, consisting of the oxidative\npolymerization of aniline and a subsequent carbonization step.1 Aniline (50 mmol, Acros, 99.5%) was\ndissolved in deionized water (40 cm3, pH 0.4; adjusted by hydrochloric acid, 1.25 M, Sigma Aldrich,\n>37%), cooled to 277 K, and subsequently added to a precooled solution (277 K) of ammonium persulfate\n(50 mmol, Acros, 98%) in deionized water (20 cm3).

In this study, NH\n\n, NO\n\n–\nand NO\n\n–\nwere quantified by ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometry with calibration curves (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n; see Methods). An industrial wastewater-relevant nitrate concentration of 2,000 ppm (refs.\n\n,\n\n) was used in our electrolyte for the standard electrochemical characterizations of the catalysts. A continuous electrolyte flow system was employed to avoid the impacts of a decreased nitrate concentration on the measured catalytic performances (Supplementary Note\n\n). The two major control samples, CuNW and RuNP, presented distinct electrocatalytic behaviours compared with that of Ru-CuNW ,b\n). RuNP showed an early onset of ammonia generation with an about 80% FE at 0.2 V, which suggests facile NO\n\nRR kinetics on the Ru sites. However, under higher overpotentials, particularly those more negative than the HER thermodynamic potential (0 V), the ammonia FE started to drop dramatically due to the strong HER competition (Supplementary \n). This is unsurprising given that Ru is a widely recognized HER-active catalyst. In a sharp contrast, CuNW presented a sluggish ammonia onset. It required large overpotentials to reach a high ammonia FE, which also indicated the Cu’s inertness to HER (Supplementary \n).\n\n,\nb\n,\nI\n–\nV\nplots (\na\n) and the corresponding NH\n\nFEs (\nb\n) of Ru-CuNW, CuNW and RuNP in a 1 M KOH with 2,000 ppm NO\n\n–\nelectrolyte at different potentials.

Overall, Ru-CuNW not only showed a good onset potential, but also suppressed HER and the undesired NO\n\n–\nby-products at high current densities and negative potentials (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). The\nI\n–\nV\nplot \n) of Ru-CuNW shows an impressive 1 A cm\n−2\ncurrent at only –0.13 V versus RHE. Additionally, Ru-CuNW reached a maximum NH\n\nFE of 96% at 0.04 V and maintained a high FE plateau across a wide potential range \n), which was dramatically improved from that of either CuNW or RuNP. These performance metrics represent a high ammonia partial current of 965 mA cm\n–2\nor a 76,500 μg h\n–1\ncm\n–2\nammonia generation rate \nand Supplementary \n), which suggests a notable improvement on those of previous reports (Supplementary \n)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n.\nWe examined isotope-labelled NO\n\n–\ncoupled with\n\nH nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis and confirmed that all our NH\n\nproducts were generated by electrochemical NO\n\nRR rather than by any contaminations \n). To compare the intrinsic activities of the catalysts, we performed electrochemical double-layer capacitance (\nC\ndl\n) tests to normalize the current density over the ECSA (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary \n). Although these catalysts present similar ECSA-normalized\nI\n–\nV\ncurves, Ru-CuNW still showed the best intrinsic activity for NO\n\nRR towards NH\n\n, followed by RuNP and then CuNW (Supplementary \n). These results clearly demonstrate that the good performance of Ru-CuNW is not only from its high surface area, but also from a higher intrinsic activity.\nDifferent nitrate sources may have a wide range of nitrate concentrations; therefore, we examined the Ru-CuNW catalytic performance at different NO\n\n–\nconcentrations to demonstrate its broad adaptability. Other than the 2,000 ppm concentration (32.3 mM), 10 mM and 100 mM NO\n\n–\nwere selected to cover the range of pollutant concentrations expected in household and heavy-industry wastewater, respectively\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Although Ru-CuNW preserved its high ammonia FE and activity under the higher nitrate concentration, the catalyst also presented an impressive performance under 10 mM NO\n\n–\n, and delivered a 400 mA cm\n–2\ncurrent density with an ammonia FE of ~90% \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). In general, to deliver both a high nitrate removal efficiency and high ammonia FE is challenging, as the competing HER could dominate when the remaining NO\n\n–\nis reduced. To evaluate Ru-CuNW’s capability in nitrate removal, we performed a batch conversion test with an initial 2,000 ppm NO\n\n–\nand measured the remaining products \n). Impressively, nearly all the N sources were converted into NH\n\nwithin one hour. The NO\n\n–\n-to-NH\n\nselectivity reached 99.8%, and the overall NH\n\nFE remained over 90%. After one hour of electrolysis, NO\n\n–\nand NO\n\n–\nwere both significantly reduced below the World Health Organization (WHO) regulations for drinking water\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. The product ratios over time (Supplementary \n) showed that we successfully collected all the N sources. These results demonstrate that Ru-CuNW not only achieves an outstanding activity and NH\n\nFE, but also serves as a promising catalyst for complete nitrate removal and/or conversion in wastewater.\nDetailed structure understanding\nA detailed understanding of the electronic and atomic structure of Ru-CuNW is required to unravel the reaction mechanism that underlies the outstanding performance. Two important questions need to be investigated. First, the oxidation state of Ru, whether metallic or oxidized, must be determined as the electronic state underpins the electrocatalytic activity. Second, the Ru structure, either as isolated atoms or metal clusters, needs to be clarified.\nTo answer the first question, we initially conducted an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The XPS survey spectra (Supplementary \n) show the existence of obvious Cu and Ru peaks in Ru-CuNW. In the high-resolution Cu 2\np\nspectrum (Supplementary \n), Ru-CuONW shows both Cu\n2+\nand Cu\n\n/Cu\n+\npeaks and the corresponding Cu\n2+\nsatellite peaks. However, Ru-CuNW only showed Cu\n\n/Cu\n+\npeaks after the prereduction process, which indicates its surface Cu was reduced. The Raman spectra also suggest that both CuO and Cu\n\nO peaks in Ru-CuONW vanished after the prereduction process (Supplementary \n). High-resolution Ru 3\nd\nXPS spectra \n) was conducted to analyse the Ru electronic structure changes. After Ru-CuONW reduced to Ru-CuNW, negative 1.0 eV energy shifts in the Ru 3\nd\npeaks were observed, which suggests the electronic state of Ru reduced from Ru\n4+\nto Ru\n\nafter the prereduction step\n\n,\n\n. A surface elemental ratio analysis (Supplementary \n) suggested the surface Ru:Cu was approximately 16:84, which is consistent with the EDS mapping result.\n\nXPS of Ru-CuNW (top) and Ru-CuONW (bottom).\nb\n,\nc\n, In situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectra at the open-circuit voltage (OCV), the 60 min prereduction process of Ru-CuONW turning into Ru-CuNW and the corresponding metal foil references at the Cu K edge (\nb\n) and Ru K edge (\nc\n).\nd\n, Ru K-edge FT-EXAFS spectra of Ru-CuNW, Ru-CuONW, and the corresponding metal and metal oxide references.

The ex situ Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and white line (Supplementary \n) shows that the Cu oxidation state in Ru-CuNW is identical to that of the reference Cu foil, which suggests that CuO reduced to the metallic state after the prereduction. To further confirm this, we performed synchrotron-based in situ XAS (Supplementary \n), and clearly demonstrated that the Cu oxidation state of the Ru-CuONW precatalyst gradually turned from the original Cu oxides into metallic Cu during the prereduction \n). In situ XAS analysis of Ru-CuNW during the NO\n\nRR also suggests that the metallic Cu state was well maintained (Supplementary \n). The in situ and ex situ Ru K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy profile and energy absorption threshold \nand Supplementary \n) indicate the Ru oxidation state shifted from a positive state in Ru-CuONW to a metallic state in Ru-CuNW. In situ XAS during NO\n\nRR further confirmed that the metallic Ru state is the active phase under the reaction conditions (Supplementary \n).\nThe corresponding Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectrum provides information of the coordination structures \n). Ru-CuONW shows an obvious Ru–O peak (1.50 Å) but no Ru–Ru peak (2.39 Å), suggesting the Ru dopants were atomically dispersed in CuONW matrix after the ion exchange process and did not form nanoclusters. This initial doping structure could minimize the accumulation of Ru metal clusters during the pre-reduction. Please note that it is difficult for FT-EXAFS to differentiate the structure of Ru atoms in Ru-CuNW, as the Ru–Ru (cluster) and Ru–Cu coordination (atomic dispersion) in FT-EXAFS are within 0.1 Å from each other and are indistinguishable\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. However, based on the further characterizations below, we later conclude the peak at 2.37 Å in Ru-CuNW should be attributed to the Ru–Cu coordination as no Ru clusters were observed.\nWe conducted synchrotron-based high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD) measurements to analyse the detailed phase present. After integrating the two-dimensional (2D) HEXRD raw images (Supplementary \n) we found that Ru-CuNW showed only Cu peaks \n). Note that no Ru peaks were observed, which confirms the absence of aggregated Ru particles. These results are consistent with our regular X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Supplementary \n) using low-energy Cu Kα radiation.\nSynchrotron-based pair distribution function (PDF) analysis was performed to further probe the local bonding environments, as it is a powerful tool for studying the atomic pair correlations\n\n,\n\n. The first peak of Ru-CuNW has a maximum at 2.56 Å \n), which exactly matches the Cu–Cu nearest-neighbour distance based on the known crystal structure (PDF: 00-004-0836) and the bond length of Cu–Cu and Cu–Ru predicted by the DFT model (Supplementary \n). The first peak of Ru foil (2.70 Å) is close to the expected distance for Ru–Ru and matches well with the DFT model. The RuO\n\nhas a Ru–O peak at 1.98 Å, but no such peaks were observed in Ru-CuNW (Supplementary \n), which further demonstrates that the Ru in Ru-CuNW was fully reduced. Cu–Ru distances are expected to broaden the Cu–Cu peak slightly, but no apparent shoulder was observed, which suggests the absence of Ru–Ru bonds in Ru-CuNW. The PDF results therefore provide supporting evidence for the absence of significant Ru clustering.\nTo further verify the atomic dispersion of Ru in the Cu matrix, we conducted atom probe tomography (APT), a technique that can provide reconstructed 3D information down to the atomic level. The Ru-CuNW specimen was first prepared for the APT reconstruction (Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary \n). The overall reconstruction \n) shows the Ru-CuNW fragments with Pt filling the empty space. In the analysed zone, we found a Ru\nn\n+\n:Cu\nn\n+\nratio of 16.9%, which is consistent with the EDS and XPS results. \ndepicts the Ru density contour map of a cross-section of the reconstruction. The Ru-rich zones were mostly found at the boundary of the Cu-rich area, which indicates the Ru were supported on the surface of the Cu nanowire. A closer examination of the Ru-rich area \n) demonstrates that the Ru atoms were highly dispersed in the Cu matrix rather than forming clusters. Nearest-neighbour distribution analysis indicated that 84% of the Ru was isolated as single atoms, with no neighbouring Ru–Ru bond formed. Therefore, based on the 3D tomography information from APT and all the characterizations above, we confirmed that the Ru dopants were in a metallic electronic state, and highly dispersed as isolated atoms in the Cu substrate.\nTheoretical analysis\nTo explain the high NH\n\nFE over Ru-CuNW compared with those over CuNW and RuNP, we used DFT to calculate the minimum energy pathway of the NO\n\nRR and HER. The NO\n\nRR pathway on the electrode surface includes: adsorption of NO\n\n–\n, deoxygenation of the N species, hydrogenation on the N species and/or N–N bond formation and desorption of the reduced species. \nshows the overall pathway for NO\n\nRR at 0 V versus RHE at pH 14.\n\nand NO\n\n–\nat 0 V versus RHE at pH = 14. The deoxygenation steps of nitrate reduction (NO\n\n*\n→ NO\n\n*\n, NO\n\n*\n→ NO\n*\nand NO\n*\n→ N\n*\n) occur along with the hydrogenation of O\n*\nand desorption of OH\n–\n(separately presented in blue shaded area). White, blue, red, brown and teal spheres correspond to H, N, O, Cu and Ru atoms, respectively.\nb\n, Nitrate adsorption versus hydrogen evolution via an alkaline pathway on different catalytic surfaces at 0 V versus RHE at pH = 14. Owing to the high pH, we considered all the H\n+\nneeded for HER or NO\n\nRR were formed via the alkaline Volmer mechanism (Methods and Supplementary \n).\nFull size image\nDFT calculations predict that NH\n\nformation is the most favourable NO\n\n–\nreaction pathway at the Ru site on Ru-CuNW, because the activation barriers along the NH\n\npath are much lower than the rate-controlling barrier for the other pathways (NO\n\n, NO, N\n\nO and N\n\n; Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Ru-CuNW minimizes the HER as NO\n\n–\nadsorption is 0.92 eV more favourable than H\n+\nadsorption at the Ru site \n) and HER is unlikely to occur on the Cu sites due to the endothermic adsorption (+0.47 eV) of H\n\nO\n*\n, the HER reactant at pH 14 (Supplementary \n). Although a more negative potential increases the likelihood of NO\n\n–\ndesorption by reducing the desorption energy, the barrier for NO\n\n–\nrelease remains higher than that for the NH\n\npathway until about –0.9 V versus RHE. The highly dispersed and isolated Ru active site additionally acts to restrict the NO\n\nRR to the Ru atom due to high reaction energy (0.39 eV) required for N\n*\nto migrate from Ru–Cu to Cu–Cu sites (Supplementary \n), and thus minimizes formation with N atoms from other Ru sites. Overall, the combination of a suppressed HER, endothermic NO\n\n–\ndesorption and restricted movement of the N\n*\nspecies on the surface leads to a high NH\n\nFE for Ru-CuNW over a wide range of potentials.\nThe poorer performance of CuNW compared with that of Ru-CuNW is attributed to the weaker adsorption of NO\n\n–\n, poor ability to hydrogenate reduced N atoms, and the sensitivity of NH\n\nvs\n. NO\n\n–\npath to the potential. First, the activation barrier for NO\n\n*\ndecomposition to NO\n\n*\nis ~0.02 eV higher than NO\n\n–\ndesorption at 0 V\nvs\n. RHE, thus it is expected that desorption is just as likely as further reaction \n). The NH\n\nFE is highly sensitive to the slight potential changes which contributes to the low NH\n\nFE at positive potentials (Supplementary Note\n\n, Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Moreover, water adsorption is endothermic by 0.46 eV on CuNW, thus there is limited H\n*\nfor NH\n\nformation. The NO\n\nRR pathway on RuNP is similar to Ru-CuNW, but the higher number of active sites available for HER and lower energy requirements for the H\n\nO adsorption increases the probability of H\n\nformation and decreases NH\n\nFE at negative potentials \n, Supplementary Note\n\n, Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). In summary, these results explain why Ru-CuNW has a superior performance for NH\n\nproduction via NO\n\nRR compared to CuNW and RuNP, and highlight the importance of highly dispersed Ru in Cu matrix.\nAmmonia product collection\nWith the impressive NO\n\nRR performance of our Ru-CuNW catalyst, we further demonstrated its practical applications by coupling the electrocatalysis with an air stripping method to continuously collect high-purity ammonia products \n). A catalyst’s good stability under an industrial-relevant current density is a prerequisite for such applications. We first conducted a long-term chronopotentiometry (CP) stability test of Ru-CuNW in a H cell with a continuous electrolyte flow. The voltage required to achieve 400 mA cm\n–2\nover our catalyst remained stable over 100 hours, with over 90% NH\n\nFE maintained \n). The effluent with the generated NH\n\nin it was air stripped (Methods) for an efficient ammonia product collection due to the high ammonia vapour pressure in the alkaline environment\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. As a result, we successfully stripped out over 99.7% of the generated ammonia from the electrolyte, with only 0.55 ppm remaining, which suggests a full denitrification of the water source and simultaneous generation of valuable ammonia \n). The stripped-out ammonia vapour was either trapped in a HCl solution or cold condensed into high-purity ammonia water. Most of the outflowing ammonia vapour (~97%) was trapped in the acid solution, and finally formed high-purity NH\n\nCl(s) powder, an important fertilizer, after performing rotary evaporation. Secondarily, the liberated NH\n\nwas subjected to a cold condensation process to produce pure NH\n\n(aq) with a NH\n\nconcentration of up to 0.3 wt%. The overall collection efficiency of both products is over 85% \n). The generation of NH\n\nCl(s) was confirmed by XRD \n) and NH\n\n(aq) by\n\nH NMR spectroscopy \n). The collection efficiencies and product purities were confirmed by UV–vis (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Overall, we demonstrated a complete process that directly converts nitrate-containing influent into practical ammonia products using our Ru-CuNW catalyst.\n\nCl(s) and concentrated NH\n\n(aq).\nb\n, Long-term CP stability test of Ru-CuNW at 400 mA cm\n–2\nin 1 M KOH with 2,000 ppm NO\n\n–\nusing a continuous flow system in an H cell.\nc\n, Conversion efficiency of different steps for the ammonia product synthesis process.

DFT revealed that the uniformly distributed Ru sites show an activated NO\n\n–\n-to-NH\n\npathway and the neighbouring Cu sites helped suppress the undesired competing HER. The effluent from our electrolysis of NO\n\nRR was combined with an air stripping process to produce NH\n\nCl fertilizer and pure NH\n\naqueous products. Future studies can be focused on how to translate this excellent catalytic performance into membrane electrode assembly devices in which no liquid electrolyte is needed for more practical implementations.\n\nCatalyst synthesis\nIn a typical procedure, 1 × 1 cm\n\nCu foam was first washed with isopropyl alcohol and then 0.1 M HCl to clean the surface. Next, the washed Cu foam was soaked in 0.1 M (NH\n\n)\n\nS\n\nO\n\nwith 1 M NaOH under ambient conditions for 1 h to oxidize Cu into Cu(OH)\n\nNW. The synthesized Cu(OH)\n\nNW was then washed with deionized water and soaked in 10 mM RuCl\n\nsolution under ambient conditions for 12 h to go through a cation exchange process. After ion exchange, the product was dried at 70 °C in an oven for 1 h and then annealed in a flowing Ar atmosphere at 200 °C for 2 h to convert it into Ru-CuONW. Finally, an in situ electrochemical prereduction step was performed after annealing, which was performed with the CP method at 100 mA cm\n–2\nfor 12 h, followed by 700 mA cm\n–2\nfor 1 h to obtain the final Ru-CuNW catalyst. Different noble-metal doped catalysts were synthesized via the same procedure, except 10 mM RhCl\n\n·\nx\nH\n\nO, OsCl\n\n·\nx\nH\n\nO and IrCl\n\n·\nx\nH\n\nO solutions were used instead of RuCl\n\n. Ru-CuNW samples with different Ru doping levels were synthesized following the same procedure, except that 2 mM, 30 mM and 100 mM RuCl\n\nsolutions were used. CuNW was synthesized by performing the same annealing and electrochemical prereduction procedure on Cu(OH)\n\nNW without the ion exchange process. RuNP was synthesized by mixing 0.2052 g of RuCl\n\nand 0.4 g of carbon black (Cabot, BP2000) into 150 m of 1 M HCl and sonicated for 2 h. Next, the mixture solution was dried by rotary evaporator, and the collected powder was annealed in a flowing Ar/H\n\natmosphere at 900 °C for 2 h to synthesize the final RuNP product.\nMaterial characterization\nSEM was performed on an FEI Quanta 400 field emission SEM. TEM, high-resolution TEM, HAADF-STEM, high-resolution HAADF-STEM and EDS elemental mapping were performed using an FEI Titan Themis aberration-corrected TEM at 300 kV and a Talos F200X transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Atomic resolution HAADF-STEM images were acquired on a JEOL JEM-AMR200F “NEOARM” equipped with an ASCOR probe corrector and operated at 80kV. XPS data were measured on a PHI Quantera spectrometer using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1,486.6 eV) and a low-energy flood gun as the neutralizer. All the XPS spectra were calibrated by shifting the detected carbon C 1\ns\npeak to 284.8 eV. Raman spectra were obtained on a Raman microscope using a 633 nm laser excitation wavelength. XAS measurements were performed at the Sector 20-BM beamline of the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory. The samples were measured in fluorescence mode, and the data processing for FT-EXAFS was performed using the ATHENA program. HEXRD measurements were carried out at 17-BM at the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory, and the obtained 2D diffraction patterns were converted into 1D patterns using GSAS II software. Regular XRD data were collected on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation.\nTotal scattering data for the PDF were collected on the Brockhouse High Energy Wiggler beamline of the Canadian Light Source using 65 keV X-ray radiation. The Ru-CuNW foam was mounted directly on the beamline. A thin sheet of Ru metal was also measured as a reference and a RuO\n\npowder reference sample was measured in a 0.63 mm inner diameter Kapton capillary. Appropriate background measurements were made for each sample. The PDF was denote as\nG\n(\nr\n) in the result, where r is the interatomic distance. The PDFs were produced using a\nQ\nmax\nof 27 Å\n–1\n.\nAtom probe tomography\nAPT analytical imaging is based on the combination of field evaporation and the principles of time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Field evaporation defines the phenomenon during which individual atoms can be evaporated from the surface they come from as ions if a strong electric field (several tens of V nm\n–1\n) is applied on the surface. To reach such an intense electric field, the samples were first fabricated as a sharp needle. APT sample preparations were performed using the standard focused ion beam lift-out process\n\nwith a FEI Quanta dual beam\n\n(Supplementary \n). Given the important presence of voids in the Ru-CuNW, Pt welding was used to fill and consolidate the final needle structure. Field evaporation was controllably provoked with the application of either short voltage pulses (~10–100 ns duration) or assisted with laser beam pulses combined with a steady electric field. Atoms were extracted one by one and projected towards a position sensitive detector, which situated the detected ion in 3D space for the reconstruction. The spatial positions and chemical identification by time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to reconstruct the 3D chemical map of the evaporated samples. A full description of the technique can be found in a previous work\n\n. In this work, we used a LEAP 4000X-HR local electrode atom probe system by CAMECA Instruments equipped with a 355 nm ultraviolet laser. The analysis was performed with a 125 kHz laser pulse frequency and 100 pJ power at 45.5 K. 3D reconstructions and analysis were conducted using CAMECA’s integrated visualization and analysis software (IVAS) version 3.8.8. Reconstruction parameters were determined with the help of the tip profile recorded by SEM after its fabrication by focused ion beam SEM (Supplementary \n).\nElectrochemical measurement\nAll electrochemical measurements were carried out in a customized H-type cell with a bipolar membrane (Fuel Cell Store) under the ambient conditions in this study. Electrochemical responses were recorded by a BioLogic VMP3 workstation. In general, 2,000 ppm NO\n\n–\nwith 1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte in both the cathode and anode unless otherwise specified. The initial electrolyte volume in each H-cell compartment was 25 ml, and the electrolyte was continuously flowed in and out as a flow-system H-cell measurement (Supplementary Note\n\n) unless otherwise specified. A stir bar was used in the H cell at a stirring rate of 1,600 revolutions per minute to minimize the mass transfer limitation in the porous electrodes. In a typical three-electrode system, a Ni foam and a saturated calomel electrode (CH Instruments) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. In this work, all the potentials measured against the saturated calomel electrode were converted to the RHE scale by:\nE\n(versus RHE) =\nE\n(versus the saturated calomel electrode) + 0.241 V + 0.0591 × pH. In the 1 M KOH electrolyte used in this work, the pH value was 14, as determined by an Orion Star A111 pH Meter (Thermo Scientific). The synthesized Ru-CuNW, Ru-CuONW and CuNW were directly used as the working electrode. For the RuNP working electrode, 5 mg of catalyst was added into 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 20 µl of a Nafion 117-containing solution (5%, Sigma-Aldrich) and sonicated for 1 h to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst ink, and then 80 µl of the catalyst ink was drop cast on a 1 × 1 cm\n\nToray carbon paper (Fuel Cell Store), which resulted in a loading of 0.4 mg cm\n–2\n. Solution resistance was measured by the potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at frequencies from 0.1 Hz to 200 kHz, and all the measured potentials were 50%\niR\n-compensated unless otherwise specified. Chronoamperometry tests were performed at a stirring rate of 1,600 revolutions per minute at constant potentials for 10 min or until a stable current was achieved to confirm that a steady-state was reached. The current densities were recorded and the electrolytes were collected to analyse the catalytic performances. Linear sweep voltammetry tests were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s\n–1\n. Complete nitrate removal tests were conducted in a batch system H cell with an initial 2,000 ppm NO\n\n–\nand 1 M KOH electrolyte for 70 min, and the electrolyte was collected every 10 min to quantify the products. Long-term stability was examined through CP tests at 400 mA cm\n–2\nin a flow-system H cell at a 3 ml min\n–1\nelectrolyte flow rate.\nFE, partial current density, yield rate and selectivity calculations\nThe FEs of NO\n\nRR towards the NH\n\nand NO\n\n–\nproducts were calculated with equation :\n$$\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\rm{FE}} = (n \\times \\nu \\times C \\times F)/i} \\end{array}$$\n\nwhere\nn\nis the electron transfer number required to form the products, which is eight for NH\n\nand two for NO\n\n–\n,\nν\nis the flow rate of the catholyte (l s\n–1\n),\nC\nrepresents the concentration of the outlet products (M),\nF\nis the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol\n–1\n) and\ni\nis the total current (A). If the experiments were conducted under the batch system, the FE was calculated by:\n$$\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\rm{FE}} = \\left( {n \\times V \\times C \\times F} \\right)/(i \\times t)} \\end{array}$$\n\nwhere\nV\nis the catholyte volume (l) and\nt\nis the total reaction time (s).\nTo calculate the partial current density of NH\n\n, the following equation was used:\n$$\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {i_{{\\rm{NH}}_3} = i \\times {{{\\mathrm{FE}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{NH}}}}_3}} \\end{array}$$\n\nIn addition, the NH\n\nyield rate was calculated by:\n$$\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {r_{{\\rm{NH}}_3} = \\nu \\times C_{{\\rm{NH}}_3}} \\end{array}$$\n\nIn the complete nitrate removal experiment in the batch system, the NO\n\n–\n-to-NH\n\nselectivity was calculated by:\n$$\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{{\\mathrm{NO}}}}_3^- - {\\rm{to}} - {{{\\mathrm{NH}}}}_3\\;{\\rm{selectivity}} = {{{\\mathrm{C}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{NH}}}}_3}/\\Delta {{{\\mathrm{C}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{NO}}}}_3^ - }} \\end{array}$$\n\nECSA analysis\nThe ECSA was determined by:\n$$\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\mathrm{ECSA} = {{C}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{dl}}}}}/{{C}}_{{{\\mathrm{s}}}}} \\end{array}$$\n\nwhere\nC\ndl\nis the double layer capacitance and\nC\ns\nis the specific capacitance of the sample. A general specific capacitance of\nC\ns\n= 0.040 mF cm\n–2\nwas used in this study based on previous reported values\n\n,\n\n.\nC\ndl\nwas determined by the equation:\n$$\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{C}}_{{{{\\mathrm{dl}}}}} = {{i}}_{{{\\mathrm{c}}}}/\\nu } \\end{array}$$\n\nwhere\ni\nc\nis the charging current and\nν\nis the scan rate. A series of cyclic voltammogram tests within the non-Faradaic potential region of 0.40–0.50 V (versus RHE) under different scan rates was performed. Next, by plotting the measured\ni\nc\nversus\nν\nand performing a linear fitting,\nC\ndl\nwas obtained from the slopes.\nAmmonia detection\nThe NH\n\nconcentration was spectrophotometrically detected by the indophenol blue method with modification\n\n. First, the outlet electrolyte product was collected and diluted to the detection range. Next, 1 ml of the diluted sample was mixed with 1 ml of 1 M NaOH, 5 wt% salicylic acid and 5 wt% sodium citrate solution. Then, 0.5 ml of 0.05 M NaClO solution and 0.1 ml of 1.0 wt% C\n\nFeN\n\nNa\n\nO (sodium nitroferricyanide) solution was added and left to rest for 2 h under ambient conditions. Next, the absorption spectrum was measured by using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600), and the formation of indophenol blue was determined using the absorbance at 655 nm wavelength. A standard concentration–absorbance calibration curve was made beforehand using a series of standard NH\n\nCl solutions. The NH\n\nproduct concentration was then calculated based on the tested absorbance and the standard curve.\nIn addition,\n\nH NMR spectroscopy (500 MHz) was also used to detect ammonia in the isotope-labelling measurement. The collected NH\n\nsample was first diluted to the detection range and adjust to pH 2.0 by adding 0.1 M HCl. Next, 0.5 ml of the sample solution was mixed 0.1 ml DMSO-\nd\n\n(hexadeuterodimethyl sulfoxide) with 0.04 wt% C\n\nH\n\nO\n\n, where DMSO-\nd\n\nserves as a solvent and maleic acid (C\n\nH\n\nO\n\n) as the internal standard. Finally, the prepared mixture was tested by a 500 MHz SB Liquid Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer at ambient condition and the NH\n\nproduct peaks were analysed.\nNitrate detection\nThe nitrate concentration was measured by UV–vis spectrophotometry according to the standard method\n\n. First, an electrolyte sample was collected and diluted to the detection range. Next, 40 µl of 1 M HCl with 4.0 µl of 0.8 wt% sulfamic acid solution was added and mixed with 2.0 ml of the diluted sample and rested for 20 min at ambient conditions. The absorption intensities at wavelengths of 220 and 275 nm were then recorded by UV–vis spectrophotometry (UV-2600). The final absorbance was calculated using the equation:\nA\n=\nA\n220nm\n–\nA\n275nm\n. The concentration–absorbance curve was calibrated using a series of standard potassium nitrate solutions with a linear fitting prepared in advance. Nitrate product concentration was then calculated based on the tested absorbance and the standard calibration curve.\nNitrite detection\nThe nitrite concentration was measured by UV–vis spectrophotometry according to the standard method\n\n. First, a mixture of\np\n-aminobenzenesulfonamide (4 g),\nN\n-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.2 g), deionized water (50 ml) and phosphoric acid (10 mL,\nρ\n= 1.685 g ml\n–1\n) was used as the colour reagent. The electrolyte sample was collected and diluted to the detection range. Next, 40 µl of the colour reagent was added into the 2.0 ml sample solution, mixed thoroughly and rested for 20 min at ambient conditions. The absorption intensity at a wavelength of 540 nm was then tested by UV–vis spectrophotometry (UV-2600). The concentration–absorbance curve was calibrated using a series of standard potassium nitrite solutions with linear fitting prepared beforehand. Nitrite product concentrations were then calculated based on the tested absorbance and the standard curve.\nComputational methods\nDetailed computational methods, which include all meta data and formula development, are described in full in Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary Tables\n\n–\n\n. In general, periodic boundary condition DFT calculations were performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional, as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. The wavefunction was constructed from a summation of the plane waves with energies below 500 eV. There was less than a 0.01 eV difference in the adsorption energies calculated at 500 and 600 eV cutoff energies. Projector-augmented wave pseudopotentials\n\nexplicitly included the H 1\ns\n, O and N 2\ns\nand 2\np\n, Cu 4\ns\nand 3\nd\n, and Ru 5\ns\nand 4\nd\nelectrons.\nCu and Ru-CuNW were represented by terminated slabs that consisted of 4 × 4 × 6 primitive units, and Ru was represented by a -terminated 4 × 4 × 6 slab. These surface terminations were chosen as they represented the low-energy surfaces\n\n. Additionally, these crystal facets were equivalent because Ru is an hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, whereas Cu is face-centred cubic (Supplementary \n). All the slabs were separated by at least 12 Å of vacuum space to reduce spurious interactions between atomic layers. The Brillouin zone was sampled with an 8 × 8 × 1 Γ-point centred Monkhorst Pack mesh for each surface and showed only a 0.01 eV difference with a 10 × 10 × 1 mesh grid. All the geometries were relaxed until forces were less than 1 × 10\n–3\neV Å\n–1\n. Transition states for the surface reactions were investigated using the climbing image nudged elastic band method with at least five images per reaction until the residual forces were below 0.001 eV Å\n–1\n(\n).\nWe used the computational hydrogen electrode\n\nto account for an arbitrary potential according to:\n$$\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {G\\left( U \\right) = G\\left( {U^0} \\right) - ne\\left( {U - U^0} \\right)} \\end{array}$$\n\nwhere\nG\n(\nU\n\n) is the free energy at 0 V versus the computational hydrogen electrode,\nU\nis the applied voltage and\ne\nis the charge of the electron.

dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) equipment, inductively coupled plasma-mass\nspectroscopy (ICP-MS, Optima 5300DV), Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM HR Evolution Raman\nmicroscope, laser excitation at 532 nm) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with\nEDS mapping being carried out at 80 kV using a JEOL ARM200F equipped with ASCOR aberration\ncorrector (cold field emission gun, Gatan Quantum ER spectrometer and Oxford X-max 100TLE SDD\nEDS). The STEM image simulation was done using the multislice algorithm.\nThe X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) including X-ray absorption near-edge structure\n(XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra measurements of metal (Mn,\nFe, Co, Ni) K-edge were carried out at the XAFCA beamline of the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source\n(SSLS)1. A Si double-crystal monochromator was applied to monochromatize the X-ray beam.\nMetal (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) foils were used for the energy calibration, and all samples were measured under\ntransmission mode at room temperature. The EXAFS oscillations χ(k) were extracted and analyzed\nusing the Demeter software package. XANES simulations, based on the DFT optimized structures, are\nperformed using the finite difference method as implemented within the FDMNES package. The cluster\ndiameter for all the simulations is 8 Å. Due to the finite mean-free path of the photoelectron and to the\ncore-hole lifetime, broadening contributions were accounted for using an arctangent convolution.\nThe S K-edge absorption was obtained by recording fluorescence yield and selected by silicon draft\ndetector (FAST SDD@ Ultra High Performance Silicon Drift Detector, Ametek), using in an ionization\n6 / 65\nchamber at tender x-ray beamline BL16A1 at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center\n(NSRRC), which is equipped with double crystal (Si ) monochromater (DCM).\nDFT calculations\nTo obtain the energy profile for the whole catalytic process, the Gibbs energy was calculated for\neach catalytic step by formula:\n∆G= ∆E+∆ZPE−T∆S𝑣\nWhere ΔE is the DFT calculated energy difference between isolated reactants, catalyst and the final\nproducts, ΔZPE means the zero-point energy correction contributed by the quantum vibration, and ΔS\nis the vibrational contribution to the entropy at finite temperature.\nFor entropy ΔS, the expression was written as:\n𝛽ℎ𝑐𝜈̃\n∆S𝑣 = R[ −ln(1−𝑒−𝛽ℎ𝑐𝜈̃]]\n𝑒𝛽ℎ𝑐𝜈̃ −1\n\nwhere R is the ideal gas constant, R=8.314 J/(mol*K), β = , c is the speed of light, ℎ is the Planck\n𝑘𝑇\nconstant, 𝜈̃ is the vibration frequencies calculated by DFT.\nFor the OER reaction, the reaction steps are written in the following ways2.\n𝐻 𝑂 + ∗ → ∗𝑂𝐻 + (𝐻++𝑒−)\n\n∗𝑂𝐻 → ∗𝑂 + (𝐻++𝑒−)\n∗𝑂 + 𝐻 𝑂 → ∗𝑂𝑂𝐻 + (𝐻++𝑒−)\n\n∗𝑂𝑂𝐻 → ∗ + 𝑂 + (𝐻++𝑒−)\n\nwhere * refers to the active site in the surface of Ni /MoS .\n1 2\n7 / 65\nThe Gibbs energy changes for the water oxidation were calculated using the following equations:\n\n∆𝐺 = ∆𝐺 −∆𝐺 +∆𝐺 = 𝐸 −𝐸 + 𝐸 −𝑒𝑈+∆ZPE−T∆S𝑣+∆𝐺\n1 ∗𝑂𝐻 ∗ 𝑝𝐻 ∗𝑂𝐻 ∗ 2 𝐻2 𝑝𝐻\n\n∆𝐺 = ∆𝐺 −∆𝐺 +∆𝐺 = 𝐸 −𝐸 + 𝐸 −𝑒𝑈+∆ZPE−T∆S𝑣 +∆𝐺\n2 ∗𝑂 ∗𝑂𝐻 𝑝𝐻 ∗𝑂 ∗𝑂𝐻 2 𝐻2 𝑝𝐻\n\n∆𝐺 = ∆𝐺 −∆𝐺 +∆𝐺 = 𝐸 −𝐸 + 𝐸 −𝑒𝑈+∆ZPE−T∆S𝑣+∆𝐺\n3 ∗𝑂𝑂𝐻 ∗𝑂 𝑝𝐻 ∗𝑂𝑂𝐻 ∗𝑂 2 𝐻2 𝑝𝐻\n∆𝐺 = ∆𝐺 −∆𝐺 +∆𝐺 = 4×[1.23𝑒𝑉−𝑒𝑈+∆𝐺 ]−(∆𝐺 +∆𝐺 +∆𝐺 )\n4 ∗+𝑂2 ∗𝑂𝑂𝐻 𝑝𝐻 𝑝𝐻 1 2 3\nwhere U is the potential measured against normal electrode (NHE) at T = 298.15 K, P = 1 bar, and a\nvalue of U = 1.23 eV is used in our calculation.

The thioacetamide precursor used here plays a\nremarkable role, namely “killing two birds with one stone”. Firstly, the decomposition of thioacetamide\nduring hydrothermal reaction not only provides S sources for the formation of 2H-phase MoS host but\n\nalso creates the desired acidic environment (Equation 1-4) to facilitate the synthesis of atomically\n\ndispersed single atoms embedded into the carrier lattice by suppressing the formation of metallic\nnanoparticle. Such a process can be described by the chemical equations 1-4 bellow. The key innovation\nin creating operando acidic conditions enables us to incorporate a high density of substitutional magnetic\nsingle-atom doping beyond the regime that has not been accessed by other hydrothermal synthesis\nmethods. A high density of magnetic dopant favours the long-range magnetic coupling, crucial for\nrealizing the ferromagnetic ordering observed in Ni /MoS .\n1 2\nCH CSNH + H O → CH CONH + H S \n3 2 2 3 2 2\nH S → H+ + HS- \n\nHS- → H+ + S2- \nMo4+ + S2- → MoS \n\n9 / 65\nSupplementary | TEM and HRTEM images of MoS without doping.\n\n10 / 65\nSupplementary | Structural characterization of various M /MoS SASCs.

Here we show that atomically intimate assembly of FeO\nx\n-Rh-ZrO\n\ndual interfaces by selectively architecting highly dispersed FeO\nx\non ultrafine raft-like Rh clusters supported on tetragonal zirconia enables highly efficient tandem conversion of syngas to ethanol. The ethanol selectivity in oxygenates reached ~90% at CO conversion up to 51%, along with a markedly high space-time yield of ethanol of 668.2 mg g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that Rh-ZrO\n\ninterface promotes dissociative CO activation into CH\nx\nthrough a formate pathway, while the adjacent Rh-FeO\nx\ninterface accelerates subsequent C–C coupling via nondissociative CO insertion. Consequently, these dual interfaces in atomic-scale proximity with complementary functionalities synergistically boost the exclusive formation of ethanol with exceptional productivity in a tandem manner.\nYou have full access to this article via\nTsinghua University\n.\nDownload PDF\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nConcerted catalysis of single atom and nanocluster enhances bio-ethanol activation and dehydrogenation\nArticle\nOpen access\n\nSynthesis of ultrafine Rh raft-like clusters on\nt-\n\nZrO\n\nusing the IWI method; passivation of exposed ZrO\n\nsurfaces by adsorption of EG through reaction with surface hydroxyls; selective deposition of one cycle of FeO\nx\nALD on Rh clusters but not on EG-blocked ZrO\n\nsurfaces by alternately exposing ferrocene (FeCp\n\n) and O\n\nat 150 °C; precise regulation of FeO\nx\ncoverages by varying the number of FeO\nx\nALD cycles; and finally, removal of EG to re-expose Rh-ZrO\n\ninterfaces to obtain dual intimate FeO\nx\n-Rh-ZrO\n\ninterfacial catalysts through 400 °C H\n\nreduction.

Clearly, Rh-ZrO\n\ninterface is much more active than Rh-SiO\n\ninterface and the Rh metal itself in CO activation\n\n.

Therein, CO conversion exhibited a volcano-like trend with the FeO\nx\ncoverage, reaching a maximum of 50.9% and an EtOH selectivity of 88.1% in oxygenates (32.6% in all products) on 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n. This greatly enhanced the EtOH STY to 368.6 mg g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n, which was approximately 97, 8 and 3 times greater than that of Rh/SiO\n\n, Rh/ZrO\n\nand Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\n, respectively, and also 2 times greater than that (175.1 mg g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n) of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n-ns with partially blocked Rh-ZrO\n\ninterfaces \n, Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). Kinetic measurements further revealed a substantially lower apparent activation energy of ~87.2 kJ mol\n−1\nfor 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\nthan those of Rh/ZrO\n\n(~105.2 kJ mol\n−1\n), Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\n(107.5 kJ mol\n−1\n) and Rh/SiO\n\n(134.8 kJ mol\n−1\n) \n), as well as those reported in the literature (99–158 kJ mol\n−1\n)\n\n, verifying the higher intrinsic activity. Impressively, the methanol selectivity of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\nwas only 7.8% in oxygenates (Supplementary \n).\nNotably, physical mixing Rh/ZrO\n\nand Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\n(denoted as Rh/ZrO\n\n+ Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\n) or depositing FeO\nx\non a Rh nanoparticle (NP) catalyst (6Fe-Rh\nNPs\n/ZrO\n\n) (Supplementary \n) all yielded low EtOH STYs of only 81.5–102.2 mg g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n(Supplementary \n). Coating Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\nwith FeO\nx\n(denoted as 6Fe-Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\n) or coating Rh/ZrO\n\nwith ZrO\n\n(denoted as 3Zr-Rh/ZrO\n\n) to create additional Rh-FeO\nx\nor Rh-ZrO\n\ninterfaces did not appreciably promote the performance either (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Therefore, the assembly of dual interfaces with complementary functionalities in atomic-scale intimacy is of essential importance for dual-interface synergies.\nWe further varied the reaction pressure from 1 MPa to 4 MPa and the H\n\n/CO ratio from 1 to 3 for the optimized 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalyst. We found that the EtOH selectivity had very trivial changes (Supplementary \n). Decreasing the weight-hourly space velocity (WHSV) from 60,000 ml g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\nto 9,000 ml g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n, the EtOH selectivity surprisingly maintained above 88% in oxygenates even at a CO conversion of 50.9% \nand Supplementary \n), sharply distinct from the rapid decline in EtOH selectivity on other three catalysts. The breakage of the activity–selectivity trade-off by dual-interface synergy boosted the single-pass yield of EtOH up to 16.6%, outperforming Rh-based catalysts reported so far (Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). Remarkably, under mild reaction conditions (Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\n), the 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalyst achieved a record high EtOH formation rate of 668.2 mg g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\nat a CO conversion of 31.5% along with a selectivity of ~90% in oxygenates (35.8% in all products), far superior to that of state-of-the-art catalysts reported so far\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\nand Supplementary \n). More importantly, 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\nalso exhibited excellent stability for at least 200 h without any Rh aggregation (Supplementary \n) or visible decline in either activity or selectivity \n), demonstrating its great potential for practical applications.\nStructural characterization\nSTEM-EDS elemental mapping showed that the Fe and Rh signals in 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\nstrongly overlapped with each other, confirming the selective deposition of FeO\nx\non the Rh clusters –d\n). FeO\nx\n-coated Rh clusters showed an average diameter of 1.2 ± 0.2 nm \nand Supplementary \n) and their intensities were again only slightly stronger than those of the isolated Rh atoms –h\n), suggesting that the raft-like structure was preserved after FeO\nx\ndecoration. Such highly dispersed, atomically thick features of FeO\nx\n-Rh rafts on ZrO\n\nnot only allow maximization of Rh atom utilization but also make Rh-ZrO\n\nand Rh-FeO\nx\ninterfaces in atomic-scale proximity.\n\n–\nd\n, A representative STEM image of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n(\na\n) and the corresponding EDS elemental mapping of the Rh (\nb\n), Fe (\nc\n) and Rh + Fe signals (\nd\n).\ne\n, A representative aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n.

The much stronger intensities of geminal dicarbonyl CO peaks suggest the high dispersion of Rh species, consistent with the STEM observations (Supplementary \n). For FeO\nx\n-coated Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalysts, the intensities of linear- and bridge-bonded CO peaks attenuated more rapidly than those of geminal dicarbonyl CO peaks as FeO\nx\nALD cycles increased and completely vanished on 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\nand Supplementary \n), demonstrating the tuning of Rh-FeO\nx\ninterfaces.\nTo determine the structure of Rh-FeO\nx\ninterfaces under realistic reaction conditions, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were further conducted. At the Fe K-edge, after H\n\nreduction of the pristine sample (6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n-O) at 400 °C (6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n-R), the pre-edge peak at 7,115 eV, corresponding to a 1\ns\n–3\nd\ntransition of Fe\n3+\noxide\n\n, disappeared along with a downshift of absorption edge even slightly lower than that of FeO reference \nand Supplementary \n).

The new peak at 2.32 Å is attributed to Fe–Rh coordination according to wavelet-transform (WT) analysis (Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). Meanwhile, the absence of Fe–Fe coordination peak (>2.5 Å) implies that the majority of Fe oxo were atomically dispersed under reaction conditions. At the Rh K-edge, 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n-R and 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n-S both showed a broad Rh–Rh coordination peak at 2.39 Å with a CN of ~6.5 \n, Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary \n), similar to that of bare Rh/ZrO\n\n(6.4–6.8) (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary \n), which agrees well with the ‘raft-like’ structure of Rh clusters since the Rh–Rh CN is expected to be greater than 8 for three-dimensional NPs\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Notably, whether Rh-FeO\nx\ninterface or RhFe alloy as the active sites has been intensively debated for decades\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Here the above data firmly excluded the possibility of RhFe alloy formation\n\n,\n\nand further supported by quasi in situ XPS measurements (Supplementary \n).\nSpectroscopic insights into syngas conversion\nIn situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to obtain insights into the dual-interface synergy. After introducing CO at 260 °C, we observed two CO peaks at 2,055 cm\n−1\nand 1,935 cm\n−1\non Rh/SiO\n\n(refs.\n\n,\n\n) \n). By contrast, strong formate peaks (HCOO*, 2,966 cm\n−1\n, 2,874 cm\n−1\n, 1,568 cm\n−1\nand 1,384 cm\n−1\n)\n\n,\n\n,\n\nalong with a broad negative hydroxyl peak centred at 3,723 cm\n−1\nwere observed on\nt\n-ZrO\n\nand Supplementary \n)\n\n,\n\n. Interestingly, these formate peaks became much stronger on Rh/ZrO\n\nand 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\nalong with the CO peaks at 2,044 cm\n−1\nand 1,830 cm\n−1\n, suggesting that formate species are more favourably formed at Rh-ZrO\n\ninterfaces.\n\n, Rh/SiO\n\n, Rh/ZrO\n\n, 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\nand 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n-ns after exposure to 10% CO/Ar for 20 min and then Ar purging for another 20 min at 260 °C.\nb\n,\nc\n, In situ DRIFTS spectra of Rh/ZrO\n\n(\nb\n) and 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n(\nc\n) after sequential exposure to CO, Ar and H\n\nat 260 °C.\nd\n, Plots of the time-dependent intensity of HCOO* (2,873–2,880 cm\n−1\n) and CH\n\nO* (2,925 cm\n−1\n) for Rh/ZrO\n\nand 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n, respectively.\nSource data\nFull size image\nSwitching CO to H\n\n, the CO peaks on Rh/SiO\n\ndecreased slowly. Neither methoxy (a key intermediate for methanol, CH\n\nO*) nor methane was observed (Supplementary \n). For Rh/ZrO\n\n, the CO peaks decreased rapidly in H\n\n, while the peaks of HCOO*, CH\n\nO* (2,925 cm\n−1\n) and gaseous CH\n\n(3,015 cm\n−1\n) all slightly increased at the early stage and then decreased gradually with time ,d\n). Clearly, CO hydrogenation is difficult at either Rh-SiO\n\ninterfaces or on Rh metal surfaces but readily occurs at Rh-ZrO\n\ninterfaces via the formate pathway (no reaction on bare\nt\n-ZrO\n\n, seen in Supplementary \n), in line with the observed much higher catalytic activity of Rh/ZrO\n\nthan Rh/SiO\n\n).\nOn 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n, switching CO to H\n\nled to a much quicker decrease in HCOO* ,d\n). Meanwhile, CH\n\nO* decreased instantly without any accumulation at the early stage, in sharp contrast to that of Rh/ZrO\n\n). Given the competition between HCOO* hydrogenation to CH\n\nO* or to CH\nx\n* at Rh-ZrO\n\ninterface, such suppression of CH\n\nO* formation implies a shift of reaction path to HCOO* → CH\nx\n*. Such a shift is likely attributed to an accelerated consumption of CH\nx\n* via C–C coupling with adsorbed CO* to form EtOH at the adjacent Rh-Fe\n\nO\n\ninterfaces, and was further supported by a faster consumption of CO* on 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\nthan on Rh/ZrO\n\n(Supplementary \n). In addition, after switching to H\n\n, hydroxyl groups were recovered on both Rh/ZrO\n\nand 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n,c\n), closing the catalytic cycle.\nTheoretical insights\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations were further conducted to gain deeper insights into dual-interface synergy. According to the presence of hydroxyls and V\nO\non\nt\n-ZrO\n\nand Supplementary \n), the most stable plane of\nt\n-ZrO\n\nwith hydroxyl groups and V\nO\nwas adopted as a support to construct the dual-interface model\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. We found that Rh\n\nclusters tend to bind strongly to defective\nt\n-ZrO\n\n by forming a flat structure with a thickness of two atomic layers and a diameter of 1.18 nm according to genetic algorithms\n\n,\n\n(Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), and enhanced charge transfers at the interface based on Bader charge analysis (Supplementary \n), which agrees excellently with the experimental results \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n,\n\nand\n\n). After testing a single Fe atom with various possible O, OH and CO ligands on the Rh\n\ncluster under reaction conditions, we found that the isolated Fe\n\nO\nx\nmotif preferentially binds at the Rh bridge sites of the Rh\n\ncluster, with the Fe atom coordinated to two Rh atoms and two tilted CO molecules (denoted as Fe\n\n(CO)\n\n/Rh\n\n/\nt\n-ZrO\n\n) \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). The two Fe–Rh bonds and two Fe–O bonds have average bond lengths of approximately 2.58 Å and 1.99 Å, respectively, which all align excellently with the XAFS results (Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\n). As a reference, we also constructed a Rh surface to model the Rh/SiO\n\ncatalyst (Supplementary \n).\n\n(CO)\n\n/Rh\n\n/\nt\n-ZrO\n\n.

The purple, green, grey, white, red (pink) and light blue balls represent the Fe, Rh, C, H, O and Zr atoms, respectively.\nSource data\nFull size image\nCO activation is commonly considered as the rate-determining step in this reaction on Rh catalysts\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. On Rh, we found that hydrogen-assisted CO activation via the HCO* intermediate is more favourable than direct dissociation (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\n), but still notably endothermic by 0.77 eV and with a high barrier of 1.80 eV \n). At Rh-FeO\nx\ninterfaces, hydrogen-assisted CO activation is considerably facilitated, with a reduced reaction energy of 0.08 eV and a barrier of 1.52 eV \n, Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n, and Supplementary \n), owing to the enhanced adsorption of HCO* and O* intermediates (Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). On\nt\n-ZrO\n\n, direct and hydrogen-assisted dissociation are both thermodynamically unfavourable (Supplementary \n). By contrast, we found that strongly adsorbed CO* (\nE\nCO\n= −1.92 eV) can readily react with OH* to form COOH* and then transform to HCOO* with a moderate barrier of 1.19 eV \n). Next, HCOO* exothermically migrates to the Rh-ZrO\n\ninterface owing to the increased adsorption energy from −1.91 eV to −3.47 eV, in line with the DRIFTS observation of much stronger HCOO* intensities on Rh/ZrO\n\nand 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\nthan on bare\nt\n-ZrO\n\n). Next, HCOO* species dissociate sequentially to HCO* and then CH* at the Rh-ZrO\n\ninterface with a barrier of 1.33 eV at most \n, Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary \n). Therefore, compared with Rh metal and Rh-FeO\nx\ninterface, Rh-ZrO\n\ninterfaces are more active for converting of CO to CH\nx\n*, where the hydroxylated\nt\n-ZrO\n\nsupport serves as a HCOO* reservoir to boost the reaction.\nRegarding C–C coupling, CO* insertion into CH\n\n* is found to be the most favourable path for Rh, Rh-FeO\nx\nand Rh-ZrO\n\ninterface (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\n). Nonetheless, on Rh, CO* insertion into CH\n\n* to form CH\n\nCO*, a key intermediate for EtOH, is much less favourable than direct CH\n\n* hydrogenation to methane \n, Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\n), which makes methane to be the preferential product over Rh metal surfaces as observed on Rh/SiO\n\n(Supplementary \n). However, at Rh-FeO\nx\ninterfaces, the adsorption of CH\n\nCO* is much stronger than that of CH\n\nCO* on Rh owing to the enhanced orbital hybridization and considerable charge transfer from Fe to CH\n\nCO* \nand Supplementary \n). Consequently, CO insertion into CH\n\n* to form CH\n\nCO* becomes exothermic by −0.23 eV at Rh-FeO\nx\ninterfaces, along with a much low barrier of 0.80 eV, which is energetically more favourable than the hydrogenation of CH\n\n* (endothermic by 0.10 eV; \n, Supplementary Figs.\n\n,\n\nand\n\n, and Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\n). At Rh-ZrO\n\n interfaces, CO* insertion into CH\n\n* to form CH\n\nCO* is found to be less feasible \n, Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\n). In brief, among these three types of reaction sites, Rh-FeO\nx\ninterfaces appear to be the most favourable sites for C–C coupling, which agree excellently with the observation of markedly higher EtOH selectivity of Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\nand\nx\nFe-Rh/ZrO\n\nas well as the suppression of CH\n\nO* formation in the DRIFTS results (Figs.\n2a\nand\n5d\n).\nTo achieve high EtOH yields in syngas conversion, it is crucial to ensure the balance of the two key elementary reaction steps: CO activation to CH\nx\n* and subsequent C–C coupling via the insertion of CO* into CH\nx\n*, both with high efficiency. As demonstrated by our calculations, the dual-interface synergy enables a tandem reaction process, that is, the Rh-ZrO\n\ninterface can efficiently activate CO* to form CH\nx\n* via the formate path with the ZrO\n\nsupport as a formate reservoir; then, the formed CH\nx\n* readily couples with another CO* molecule to form CH\n\nCO* intermediates at the adjacent Rh-FeO\nx\ninterfaces, thus synergistically boosting exclusive EtOH formation \n). Therein, the variation of the FeO\nx\ncoverage (Supplementary \n) allows balancing the kinetics of these two key elementary reactions (Supplementary \n), thus achieving a remarkably high EtOH productivity.\nConclusion\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that the precise decoration of atomically dispersed FeO\nx\nonto ultrafine Rh rafts in Rh/ZrO2 to assemble dual FeO\nx\n-Rh-ZrO\n\ninterfaces intimately enables efficient tandem conversion of syngas to EtOH by achieving an EtOH selectivity of ~90% in total oxygenates at an appreciable conversion of 51%, along with a remarkably high STY of 668.2 mg g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n. In situ spectroscopic characterization and DFT calculations reveal that Rh-ZrO\n\nand Rh-FeO\nx\ninterfaces play complementary roles in the reaction by facilitating CO activation and C–C coupling, respectively. The delicate assembly of these two interfaces in atomic-scale proximity finely tailors the balance of the kinetics of the two key elementary reactions, thus synergistically boosting the exclusive EtOH formation in a tandem manner. These findings point out a new way to rationally design highly active and selective metal catalysts for complex reactions by assembling dual/multiple metal–oxide interfaces with specific functions in atomic-scale proximity.\n\nMethods\nChemicals and materials\nZirconium\nn\n-propoxide (70 wt% in\nn\n-propanol), rhodium nitrate solution (Rh(NO\n\n)\n\n, 5 wt% solution), ferrocene (FeCp\n\n) and tetrakis(dimethylamido)zirconium (Zr(NMe\n\n)\n\n) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ammonia solution (NH\n\n·H\n\nO, 25–28%), EG and\nn\n-propanol (>99.9%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. All the chemicals were directly used without further purification.\nAll gases, including ultrahigh-purity N\n\n(99.999%), Ar (99.999%), mixtures of 10% O\n\nin Ar, 10% H\n\nin Ar, and 10% Co in Ar and CO feed gases (24% CO, 72% H\n\n; 30% CO, 60% H\n\n; 45% CO, 45% H\n\n; all balanced with Ar), were provided by Nanjing Special Gases.\n\nSynthesis of ZrO\n\nsupport\nThe tetragonal zirconia support was synthesized via a sol–gel method. Typically, 17.7 g of zirconium\nn\n-propoxide was diluted by adding 51.6 ml of\nn\n-propanol. Aqueous ammonia was added dropwise to the zirconia precursor solution with vigorous stirring until the pH reached 10–10.5, after which the mixture was kept for 1 h. The resulting gel was filtered and dried at 100 °C for 10 h. Finally, the dried sample was calcined at 400 °C in air for 4 h to obtain the ZrO\n\nsupport.\n\nSynthesis of Rh/ZrO\n, Rh/SiO\n\n, Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\nand Rh\nNPs\n/ZrO\n\nRh/ZrO\n\nwas prepared by the IWI method. First, 420 μl of Rh(NO\n\n)\n\nsolution was added to 100 μl of deionized water. Next, 600 mg of ZrO\n\nwas impregnated into the above Rh aqueous solution with 30 min of stirring, after which the mixture was dried at 70 °C overnight. Finally, the obtained yellow powder was calcined at 400 °C in air for 3 h to obtain the Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalyst. Rh/SiO\n\nand Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\nwere also synthesized through the same IWI method described above for comparison. Meanwhile, a Rh NP catalyst (Rh\nNPs\n/ZrO\n\n) was also synthesized by the deposition–precipitation method followed by chemical reduction using sodium borohydride (NaBH\n\n) as the reducing agent. Typically, 420 μl of Rh(NO\n\n)\n\nsolution and 600 mg of ZrO\n\nwere co-added into 25 ml of deionized water and mixed under vigorous stirring at 80 °C for 0.5 h. Ammonia was added dropwise to adjust the pH value to 12. Then, 1 ml of 1 mol l\n−1\nNaBH\n\nwas quickly added into the above suspension and kept vigorous stirring for 12 h. The precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the dried dark yellow powder was calcined in 10% O\n\nin Ar at 400 °C for 3 h and then reduced at the same temperature for another 1 h in 10% H\n\nin Ar to obtain the Rh\nNPs\n/ZrO\n\ncatalyst.\n\nSynthesis of the\n\nx\nFe-Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalysts\nTo achieve selective FeO\nx\ndeposition on Rh NPs instead of on a ZrO\n\nsupport for the subsequent synthesis of\n\nx\nFe-Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalysts, the as-prepared Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalyst was first modified with EG to passivate the possible nucleation sites on the ZrO\n\nsurface. Typically, the Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalyst was dispersed into EG and stirred for 12 h at 30 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged and dried at 70 °C overnight to obtain the modified catalyst.\nFeO\nx\nALD was carried out on the resulting EG-pretreated Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalyst at 150 °C using FeCp\n\nand ultrahigh-purity O\n\n(99.999%) in an ALD reactor (ALD-V401-PRO, ACME (Beijing) Technology). The FeCp\n\nprecursor container was heated to 80 °C to achieve sufficient vapour pressure. The timing sequences were 300 s, 300 s, 200 s and 300 s for FeCp\n\nexposure, N\n\npurge, O\n\nexposure and N\n\npurge, respectively. Different cycles of FeO\nx\nALD were carried out to obtain a series of\nx\nFe-Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalysts (\nx\nrepresents the number of ALD cycles). For comparison, 6 cycles of FeO\nx\nALD were also applied to Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\nand Rh\nNPs\n/ZrO\n\nto obtain the 6Fe-Rh/Fe\n\nO\n\nand 6Fe-Rh\nNPs\n/ZrO\n\ncatalysts, respectively. As a control experiment, FeO\nx\nALD was also performed on the bare ZrO\n\nand EG-modified ZrO\n\nsubstrates for different cycles under the same ALD conditions.\n\nSynthesis of the\n\nx\nZr-Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalysts\nZrO\n\nALD was carried out on the Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalyst at 200 °C using Zr(NMe\n\n)\n\nand deionized water in the same ALD reactor. The Zr(NMe\n\n)\n\nprecursor container was heated to 75 °C to achieve sufficient vapour pressure. The timing sequences were 200 s, 300 s, 200 s and 300 s for Zr(NMe\n\n)\n\nexposure, N\n\npurge, H\n\nO exposure and N\n\npurge, respectively. One and three cycles of ZrO\n\nALD were carried out to obtain the 1Zr-Rh/ZrO\n\nand 3Zr-Rh/ZrO\n\ncatalysts, respectively.\nMorphology and composition\nTEM and HR-TEM measurements were performed on a JEM-2100F instrument operated at 200 kV to characterize the morphology of these samples. Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM measurements were performed on an instrument at 200 kV (JEM-ARM200F, University of Science and Technology of China). Elemental mapping via EDS was performed on the same equipment. The Rh and Fe contents of the various catalysts were analysed via ICP-AES (PerkinElmer Optima 7300 DV). Powder XRD measurements were carried out on a Philips X’Pert Pro Super diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 50 mA. The patterns were measured in the 2\nθ\nrange from 20° to 80°. EPR spectroscopy was performed on a JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer operated at an X-band frequency of 9.1 GHz, a microwave power of 1 mW and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA550 instrument (TA Instruments) equipped with an evolved gas analysis furnace. After loading the sample into the furnace, the sample was heated to 500 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C min\n−1\nin 10% O\n\nin N\n\n(25 ml min\n−1\n). CO pulse chemisorption measurements were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. In brief, ~40 mg of the sample was loaded in a quartz U-tube and calcined in 10% O\n\nin Ar followed by a reduction in 10% H\n\nin Ar at 150 °C for 2 h. Next, the sample was cooled to room temperature, and CO pulses (10% CO in He) were introduced to the sample until saturation.\nIn situ XAS\nIn situ XAS measurements at the Fe K-edge (7,112 eV) and Rh K-edge (23,220 eV) were performed in fluorescence mode with a Si monochromator at the 1W1B beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) and in transmission mode with a Si monochromator at the BL14W1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) in China, respectively, considering the loadings of Fe and Rh. The storage ring of the BSRF worked at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA, and the storage ring of the SSRF worked at 3.5 GeV with a maximum current of 210 mA. A homemade reaction cell was used for the in situ experiments, which allows exposing the sample to different pretreatment gases or reaction gases, as well as sample heating to 500 °C. Typically, the as-prepared 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\nsample was compressed into tablets and put into the reaction cell. After purging with He for 10 min at room temperature, the XAFS spectra were recorded and denoted as 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n-O. After that, the sample was reduced in 10% H\n\nin He at 400 °C for 1 h and then cooled to 260 °C for 10 min. The XAFS spectrum was recorded and denoted as 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n-R. Finally, the same sample was exposed to syngas consisting of 24% CO and 72% H\n\nbalanced with He at 260 °C for another 1 h, and the XAFS spectra were sequentially recorded and denoted as 6Fe-Rh/ZrO\n\n-S. The acquired XAS data were processed according to standard procedures using the ARTEMIS module implemented in the IFEFFIT software package. The EXAFS oscillation functions\nχ\n(\nk\n) were obtained by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption spectra and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step.\nIn situ XPS\nIn situ XPS measurements were conducted at the BL10B beamline Photoemission End-station at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in Hefei, China. In brief, the beamline is connected to a bending magnet and covers photon energies from 100 eV to 1,000 eV. The end-station consists of four chambers, that is, an analysis chamber, a preparation chamber, a quick sample load lock chamber and a high-pressure reactor. The analysis chamber, with a base pressure of <5 × 10\n−10\ntorr, is connected to the beamline and equipped with a VG Scienta R3000 electron energy analyser and a twin anode X-ray source. After sample treatment, the reactor was pumped down to high vacuum (<10\n−8\ntorr) for sample transfer. In the current work, the sample was first reduced with the flowing 10% H\n\nin Ar at 400 °C for 1 h followed by treatment in syngas (24% CO, 72% H\n\n, 4% Ar) (20 ml min\n−1\n) at 260 °C for another 1 h at the ambient pressure in the high-pressure reactor. Next, the sample was transferred to the analysis chamber for XPS measurements in the Fe 2"

Subsequently, the mixture was heated to 550 °C at a controlled heating rate of 5 °C min\n−\n\nin a 5% H\n\n/Ar atmosphere. It was maintained at this temperature for 6 h to ensure complete reduction. The sample was naturally cooled to room temperature, resulting in the formation of CuZSM CLNP. The product was washed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by centrifugation, and then dried overnight at 60 °C.\n\nSynthesis of Cu NPs-5 nm, Cu NPs-20 nm and Cu NPs-100 nm\nIn a typical preparation of Cu NPs-5 nm, 13.3 mg Cu(acac)\n\n(Sigma-Aldrich), 27 mg ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 ml oleylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 ml oleic acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) were mixed and ultrasonicated for approximately 0.5 h in a sealed vial (30 ml). Then, the vial was transferred into an oil bath and heated at 180 °C for 3 h (\n). The resulting colloidal products in the vial were collected by centrifugation and then washed with an ethanol/cyclohexane mixture to obtain Cu NPs-5 nm. The preparations of Cu NPs-20 nm and Cu NPs-100 nm were similar to that of Cu NPs-5 nm but without adding oleic acid and ascorbic acid, respectively."

To stabilize isolated metal atoms with high and practical M\n\nloadings, the CeO\nx\nnanoislands must be ultrasmall (less than 2 nm), isolated and densely populated on high-surface-area supports, and M\n\nshould be selectively deposited onto them. Thus, CeO\nx\nnanoislands were synthesized by strong electrostatic adsorption\n\nof charged species from aqueous solution \n). The point of zero charge of SiO\n\n(278 m\n\ng\n−1\n) is 3–4 (refs.\n\n,\n\n), so that in an alkaline solution its zeta potential is negative.

Positively charged Ce-containing species electrostatically adsorb onto negatively charged high-surface-area SiO\n\nsupport. During high-temperature calcination, atomically dispersed Ce species self-assemble into ultrasmall CeO\nx\nnanocrystallites. These ultrasmall, isolated CeO\nx\nnanoclusters act as functional nanoglues to localize metal atoms and to provide active oxygen species. By judiciously adjusting the aqueous solution pH so that CeO\nx\nnanoclusters are positively charged, negatively charged Pt-containing species selectively adsorb onto the CeO\nx\nnanoclusters.

Raman spectra show a broadened and red-shifted active mode at frequencies from 462 to 448 cm\n−1\n, suggesting substantial lattice distortion in the CeO\nx\nnanocrystallites (Extended Data \n), with a band at approximately 600 cm\n−1\ncharacterizing oxygen vacancies\n\n. Lattice spacings in the CeO\nx\nnanocrystallites, measured by HAADF-STEM, indicate an expansion of the CeO\n\n{111} plane spacing from 0.31 nm in bulk CeO\n\nto 0.33 nm in the CeO\nx\nnanoclusters (Extended Data \n), consistent with the slight XRD peak shift to lower angles.\nX-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) \nand Extended Data \n) show 28.7%, 10.9% and 8.4% Ce\n3+\nspecies in CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, CeO\n\nand CeO\n\nNPs/SiO\n\n, respectively\n\n,\n\n. The greater density of Ce\n3+\nsites in CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nimplies more anchoring sites on CeO\nx\nnanoclusters for metal atoms\n\n,\n\n. XPS (which probes nanometres below the sample surface\n\nand therefore characterizes the full CeO\nx\nnanoclusters) showed a Ce\n3+\n:(Ce\n3+\n+ Ce\n4+\n) ratio corresponding to a composition of CeO\n1.86\n. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction data show that these CeO\nx\nnanoclusters were reduced at approximately 492 °C (in contrast with CeO\n\npowders reduced at approximately 782 °C) (Extended Data \n), implying that reduction of CeO\nx\nnanoclusters to give Ce\n3+\nspecies\n\nis much more facile than that of CeO\n\nNPs. Harsh H\n\nreduction of CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nat 600 °C gave amorphous CeO\nx\nstructures (Extended Data \n), but re-calcination at 600 °C reformed them.\nIn summary, the as-synthesized CeO\nx\nnanoglue islands are crystalline, ultrasmall, isolated on the SiO\n\nsupport, and characterized by a high number density of defect sites, making them well suited as hosts for strongly bonded and isolated Pt atoms\n\n,\n\n.\nStrong electrostatic adsorption deposited Pt atoms on the CeO\nx\nnanoclusters but not the SiO\n\nsupport \n), because CeO\n\n(point of zero charge of approximately 8.1)\n\nsurfaces are positively charged when in contact with acidic Pt precursor solutions of pH 3–5, so that PtCl\n\n2−\nis attracted to the CeO\nx\nnanoclusters (Extended Data \n). To synthesize CeO\nx\n-supported Pt\n\nsingle-atom catalysts, the Pt loading was controlled at less than or equal to 0.4 wt% (with respect to the CeO\nx\n) such that, on average, each CeO\nx\nnanocluster contained less than one Pt atom (Extended Data ,c\n). High Pt loadings, which are industrially desirable (for example, up to 1 wt% Pt), can be realized by increasing the SiO\n\nsurface area and/or the number density of isolated CeO\nx\nnanoclusters (Extended Data –f\n). Residual chloride was removed by washing and high-temperature calcination (Extended Data –i\n).\nThe locations of isolated metal atoms on supports determine their catalytic properties\n\n. Individual Pt atoms on well crystallized CeO\n\nNPs have been observed by HAADF-STEM\n\n, but unambiguous identification of Pt atoms on ultrasmall CeO\nx\nnanoclusters is beyond the capability of this technique (Extended Data –c\nand\n\nMethods\n). However, an extensive HAADF-STEM investigation of Pt atoms and clusters on the CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncan firmly identify Pt clusters with sizes greater than 0.4 nm if present on the samples (Extended Data \n). Analysis of numerous atomic-resolution images of the 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst gave no evidence of Pt atoms or clusters on the SiO\n\nsurfaces, confirming that the deposited Pt species were restricted to CeO\nx\nnanoislands—either as single atoms or clusters with sizes less than 0.4 nm.\nX-ray absorption spectra provided further insights into the nature of the Pt species. Pt L\nIII\n-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) data \n) characterizing the calcined 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nshow that the Pt was cationic, with an oxidation state close to that in bulk PtO\n\n(\n). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra \n) indicate atomically dispersed Pt, with no evidence of a Pt–Pt scattering path in the spectra of the 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nand Extended Data –j\n). A Pt–O shell indicating Pt–CeO\nx\nbonding was found with a coordination number of 4.5 ± 0.5 and a bonding distance of 1.97 ± 0.02 Å (error bounds defined in Extended Data \n), consistent with EXAFS data for site-isolated platinum on cerium dioxide or iron oxide\n\n,\n\n. Diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectra (DRIFTS) of the 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, after CO adsorption, show a sharp single peak near 2,103 cm\n−1\nwith a full-width at half-maximum of 12.8 cm\n−1\n\n), assigned to CO adsorbed on isolated cationic Pt\n\n,\n\n, consistent with the XANES and EXAFS results.\n\n,\nb\n, Pt L\nIII\n-edge XANES spectrum (\na\n) and Fourier transform of\nk\n\n-weighted EXAFS spectrum of the as-synthesized 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst (\nb\n).

Both the calcined and H\n\n-reduced 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncontained only single, isolated Pt atoms.\nSource data\nFull size image\nTo further understand the stability of the atomically dispersed Pt, the behaviour of Pt atoms on other supports under various conditions was compared. The data include those obtained for Pt atoms on SiO\n\nand on CeO\n\n. Under reducing or oxidizing environments at temperatures greater than 300 °C, Pt atoms on SiO\n\nsintered considerably (Extended Data –f\n), demonstrating weak Pt–SiO\n\ninteractions\n\n. Single Pt atoms on CeO\n\nNPs did not sinter during calcination, even at high temperatures (Extended Data –h\n)\n\n,\n\n. Exposure to H\n\nat 300 °C for 1 h, however, caused breaking of Pt–O bonds, migration of Pt atoms on CeO\n\nNPs and sintering of Pt atoms to form clusters and NPs (Extended Data –k\n). After similar treatment, the Pt NPs formed on CeO\n\nwere smaller than those formed on SiO\n\n(Extended Data \n), suggesting that the Pt–CeO\n\ninteraction is stronger than the Pt–SiO\n\ninteraction during the H\n\n-reduction treatment. Investigations of Pt sandwiched between hetero-structured CeO\n\n–SiO\n\ncore–shell model systems confirmed the stronger interaction of Pt atoms with CeO\n\nthan with SiO\n\n, resulting in the suppression of Pt diffusion from CeO\n\nonto SiO\n\n(Extended Data \nand\n\nMethods\n).\nThe stability of the CeO\nx\n-supported Pt single-atom catalyst (Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n) was investigated under reducing conditions. CeO\n\nNP-supported Pt atoms became mobile at temperatures greater than 300 °C for 1 h in H\n\n, but Pt atoms, confined to the isolated CeO\nx\nislands, did not sinter, even after H\n\nreduction at 300 °C for 10 h, as shown by DRIFTS and HAADF-STEM data \nand Extended Data \n). The minimal difference in the CO absorption bands characterizing Pt atoms in the reduced versus the as-synthesized catalysts is evidence that the CO probe molecules used in the DRIFTS experiments reduced the Pt atoms in the as-synthesized Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, as expected\n\n. To further probe the stability of Pt atoms localized on the CeO\nx\nislands, samples were exposed to H\n\nat temperatures of 400–600 °C. Even under these harsh reducing conditions, the Pt remained as isolated single atoms (Extended Data –d\n). The infrared absorption bands characterizing CO on Pt atoms were shifted after reduction in H\n\nat temperatures greater than 500 °C, suggesting modifications of the Pt–CeO\nx\ninteractions\n\n, which were corroborated by density functional theory calculations (Extended Data \n). Because the DRIFTS experiments were conducted under oxygen-free environments, formation of Pt\nx\nO\ny\nclusters was excluded (Extended Data –h,k–p\nand\n\nMethods\nsection ‘Extended results and discussions’)\n\n. Both Ce XPS and Pt XAS data show that formation of Pt clusters or Pt–Ce alloy species under the reduction conditions did not occur (Extended Data Figs.\n7i\n,\n9i–p\n). Thus, notwithstanding changes in the catalysts, the Pt remained site-isolated, with the changes restricted to the host CeO\nx\nislands. By contrast, decreasing Pt atom number density on CeO\n\nsupports (with loadings lower than that of the 0.4 wt% Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n) did not prevent Pt atoms from forming clusters and NPs after reduction in H\n\nat 400 °C (Extended Data \n).\nTo confirm that during H\n\nreduction the Pt confinement on SiO\n\n-supported CeO\nx\nislands also applies to SiO\n\n-supported CeO\n\nNPs, a sample containing Pt atoms dispersed on SiO\n\n-supported 8-nm CeO\n\nNPs (0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\n\nNPs/SiO\n\n) was exposed to H\n\nat 300 °C for 1 h. The data (Extended Data –c\n) show that the Pt atoms did not migrate onto SiO\n\n, but they did sinter to form small Pt clusters, because larger CeO\n\nNPs, on average, contained more than one Pt atom, further confirming the conclusion that under reduction conditions Pt atoms sinter on CeO\n\nsurfaces. The CO DRIFTS data (Extended Data –f\n) correspondingly show evidence of CO adsorbed on Pt clusters and NPs. In sharp contrast to the narrow DRIFTS peak characterizing the reduced 0.4 wt% Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n), the broad overlapping DRIFTS peaks characterizing the reduced 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\n\nNPs/SiO\n\ndemonstrate the presence of Pt species with a wide range of nuclearities and/or oxidation states. Both the ultrasmall size and isolation of the CeO\nx\nnanoglue islands by SiO\n\nare critical to confining Pt species to prevent sintering.\nFurther experiments were conducted with high loadings of Pt (4 wt%) on SiO\n\n-supported CeO\nx\nnanoislands to investigate synthesis and confinement of uniform Pt clusters on them. After reduction in H\n\nat 300 °C for 3 h, Pt clusters were detected by CO DRIFTS (Extended Data \n). HAADF-STEM images show uniform Pt clusters (an average size of approximately 0.9 nm) attached to the isolated CeO\n\nx\nislands when the reduction temperature increased to 400 °C (Extended Data \n). After reduction at 500 °C for 12 h, the CeO\nx\nislands became amorphous, but the Pt clusters nonetheless retained their sizes and were still attached to the islands (Extended Data –j\n). The absence of Pt NPs with sizes greater than 1 nm in these severely reduced catalysts with high Pt loading highlights the effectiveness of the CeO\nx\nnanoglue strategy for stable localization of Pt species (from isolated metal atoms to subnanometre clusters) and for preventing the formation of larger Pt NPs, thus expanding their potential for practical applications.\nWe note that the active phase in many catalysts is pre-formed by reduction, and that H\n\ntreatment at temperatures greater than 200 °C usually causes sintering of atomically dispersed noble metals\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. In addition to limiting applications, this restructuring also hinders fundamental investigations of single-atom catalyst performance and structure–property relationships. The robustness of the 0.4 wt% Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nunder both oxidizing and reducing environments offers new opportunities in this regard.\nCeria-supported single Pt atoms were reported to be less active for CO oxidation than CeO\n\n-supported Pt clusters\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, and our data verify this pattern (Extended Data –c\n). Because our CeO\nx\nnanoisland-confined Pt single-atom catalysts remain stable after reductive activation, we could explore CO oxidation performances and  show \n) that the temperature for 50% CO conversion is 133 °C for the H\n\n-activated Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nand 226 °C for the non-activated Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n. This result demonstrates that H\n\nactivation increases the CO oxidation rate by two orders of magnitude and decreases the apparent activation energy (Extended Data \n). The XANES and EXAFS data indicate that H\n\nreduction removes oxygen ligands, reduces the coordination number of the first Pt–O shell from 4.5 ± 0.5 to 3.2 ± 0.3 and reduces Pt\n4+\nto Pt\nδ\n+\n(refs.\n\n,\n\n,\n\n) without sintering the isolated Pt atoms (Extended Data –p\n). Comparison against catalysts prepared on other CeO\n\nsupports or by impregnation of CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nand SiO\n\nwith Pt salt solutions shows that the H\n\n-activated 0.4 wt% Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nis much more stable and active for CO oxidation (Extended Data –h,r–t\n).\n\n-activated 0.4 wt% Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nsingle-atom catalyst (CO oxidation on the CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncontrol catalyst is also shown). Activation of the 0.4 wt% Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nby H\n\nreduction at 300 °C for 1 h greatly increased its activity for CO oxidation. The cycling test was conducted with a temperature ramp to 200 °C.\nSource data\nFull size image\nThese observations illustrate the value of the CeO\nx\nnanoglue design strategy, implemented with our scalable strong electrostatic adsorption process for dispersing CeO\nx\n(\nx\n≈ 1.86) nanoglue islands with an average dimension of 2 nm or smaller onto a robust, high-surface-area SiO\n\nsupport and then selectively localizing Pt atoms on these islands. The CeO\nx\nnanoglue islands incorporate abundant Ce\n3+\nthat strongly anchors Pt atoms and small clusters under either O\n\nor H\n\nenvironments, even at elevated temperatures. Challenges for practical applications remain, however, such as the partial and reversible oxidation of the Pt\n\natoms and associated lowering of catalyst activity seen at higher temperatures (for example, 300 °C) under oxidizing conditions (\n\nMethods\nsection ‘Extended results and discussions’ and Extended Data –p\n). But with our strategy for confining metal atoms by functional nanoglues applicable to metals other than Pt (including Pd and Rh; see Extended Data \n) and in principle able to produce a wide range of robust single-atom and cluster catalysts, we anticipate that it will prove useful for numerous catalytic transformations.\n\nPreparation of nanoglues and support materials\n\nSiO\n\n-supported CeO\nx\nIn general, OH\n−\nions in alkaline solutions act as strong coordination agents for Ce\n3+\nions to form cationic complexes, but excessive OH\n−\nresults in precipitation of Ce(OH)\n\n(solubility product constant\nK\nsp\n= 1.6 × 10\n−20\n)\n\n. To avoid the formation of Ce(OH)\n\nprecipitates from the solution phase, the concentration of the OH\n−\nwas carefully controlled to maintain a relatively stable aqueous solution containing soluble [Ce(OH)\n\n]\n+\nand [Ce(OH)]\n2+\ncomplexes\n\n. Dissolved O\n\nin the aqueous solution slowly oxidizes Ce\n3+\ninto Ce\n4+\n, the concentration of which grows with time to reach the precipitation limit of Ce(OH)\n\n(\nK\nsp\n= 2 × 10\n−48\n)\n\n. Under well controlled synthesis conditions, the strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) of [Ce(OH)\n\n]\n+\nand [Ce(OH)]\n2+\n\noccurs within minutes\n\n, a much shorter time than that needed for precipitating Ce(OH)\n\n. Such a time difference in the dynamic adsorption and precipitation processes allows efficient, facile production of uniformly decorated high-surface-area SiO\n\nwith Ce species via the SEA process.\nIn a typical procedure for synthesizing 12 wt% CeO\nx\nnanoglue islands on SiO\n\n, 360 mg of fumed SiO\n\npowder (Alfa Aesar, total Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area 278 m\n\ng\n−1\n) was mixed with 100 ml of deionized (DI) water, and the resultant aqueous solution was sonicated to produce a uniform mixture. Under vigorous stirring, 0.4 mmol of Ce(NO\n\n)\n\n·\n6H\n\nO was dissolved in the above solution, and 0.8 ml of NH\n\n·\nH\n\nO (2 M) was quickly injected into the solution with further stirring for 3 min prior to vacuum filtration. The final solution pH was about 8.7. The resultant precipitates were removed for air drying overnight at room temperature. The dried powders were ground to smaller particles and were then calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 or 600 °C (with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min\n−1\n) for 12 h. This facile synthesis protocol was easily scaled up to routinely produce 10 times more of the final product.\n\nSiO\n\n-supported CeO\n\nNPs (IMP) by impregnation\nThe SiO\n\n-supported 12 wt% CeO\n\nNPs were prepared using the same precursors as described above. The pore volume of the SiO\n\nwas determined to be ~2.1 ml g\n−1\n. Therefore, 0.8 mmol of Ce(NO\n\n)\n\n·\n6H\n\nO was dissolved in 2.1 ml of DI water. As the sample was stirred, 2.1 ml of precursor solution was slowly added to 1 g of SiO\n\npowder to ensure complete wetting of the support by the Ce-containing solution. The final mixture was air-dried overnight prior to oven drying at 60 °C for 12 h. The dried powders were ground and then calcined at 600 °C (the temperature was ramped at a rate of 5 °C min\n−1\n) in a muffle furnace.\nPure CeO\n\npowders\nTo synthesize pure CeO\n\n, 2 g of Ce(NO\n\n)\n\n·\n6H\n\nO was dissolved in 100 ml of DI water. With the sample vigorously stirred, 2 ml of 15% ammonia solution was slowly injected into the above solution to form a suspension. The product was continuously stirred overnight in open air. Vacuum filtration was used to repeatedly wash the precipitates with DI water. The final light-yellow powders were ground and then calcined at 500 °C for 4 h.\nSelective deposition of Pt atoms and preparation of Pt catalysts\nPt/CeO\n\nx\n/SiO\n\n, Pt/CeO\n\nNPs/SiO\n\nand Pt/CeO\n\nIn a typical synthesis protocol, 300 mg of support (500 °C-calcined CeO\n\nx\n/SiO\n\n, CeO\n\nNPs/SiO\n\n) was immersed in 70 ml of DI water and sonicated. The pH of the solution was adjusted to ~3 by addition of HCl. Simultaneously, 3.0 μmol of H\n\nPtCl\n\n·\n6H\n\nO was diluted in 50 ml of aqueous solution (pH of ~3 by addition of HCl). With the sample vigorously stirred and within 5 h, the Pt precursor solution was slowly pumped to the aqueous solution containing the corresponding support powders. After being stirred for another 5 h, the final mixture was filtered via vacuum filtration to obtain the precipitates, which were washed several times with DI water to remove residual Pt ions and other species. After the final catalyst precursor powders were dried in air, they were calcined at 600 °C for 12 h to obtain the as-synthesized catalysts. 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO\n\ncatalyst was synthesized by using 30 μmol of H\n\nPtCl\n\n·\n6H\n\nO and 300 mg of CeO\n\npowder. The high Pt loading (4 wt% Pt with respect to CeO\nx\n) Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst was synthesized by using 61 μmol of H\n\nPtCl\n\nin the above process. After calcination, 4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst was reduced in H\n\nat 400 °C to produce Pt clusters. The Pt\nx\nO\ny\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nsamples were produced by mildly calcining the CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nsupported Pt cluster catalysts at 100 °C. For Pd/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nand Rh/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, 14 μmol of PdCl\n\nand 5.8 μmol of RhCl\n\nwere used in the synthesis process, respectively.\nPt/CeO\n\nx\n/SiO\n\n(IMP) by impregnation\nThe pore volume of the as-synthesized CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nwas determined to be 1.8 ml g\n−1\n. With stirring, 0.54 ml of aqueous solution containing H\n\nPtCl\n\nprecursor salt was slowly added to 300 mg of CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\npowder to ensure complete wetting of the support surfaces by the precursor salt solution. The mixture was then dried at 60 °C for 12 h in an oven. The resultant 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n(IMP) powders were ground and then calcined at 300 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace.

The final mixture was dried at 60 °C for 12 h in an oven. The dried powders were ground and then calcined at 300 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace.\nPt/SiO\n\n(SEA)\nIn a typical synthesis process, Pt(NH\n\n)\n\nCl\n\nwas used as precursor to adsorb Pt(NH\n\n)\n\n2+\nonto negatively charged SiO\n\nsurfaces in the presence of alkaline solution. Commercial SiO\n\npowders (180 mg) were dispersed in 50 ml of DI water and the solution was kept alkaline by adding 0.2 ml of 2-M ammonia solution. Then 1 ml of aqueous solution containing 3.2 mg of Pt(NH\n\n)\n\nCl\n\nwas injected into the SiO\n\nsuspension that was vigorously stirred for 3 h. The as-prepared Pt/SiO\n\ncatalysts, without calcination, contained both Pt single atoms and Pt clusters (Extended Data ,b\n). The Pt loading on commercial SiO\n\npowders was determined to be 0.5 wt% by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements.\n\nPreparation of core–shell samples\n\nSiO\n\nspheres\nSiO\n\nspheres were produced by the Stöber method\n\n: 30 ml of DI water, 150 ml of ethanol, and 18 ml of ammonia (~25%–28%) were mixed in a flask. Then 12 ml of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added to the solution, which was heated to 58 °C and stirred for 2 h. Then the solvent was removed by evaporation at 100 °C, and the resultant powder was calcined for 2 h at 500 °C.\nPt/SiO\n\nspheres\n500 mg of SiO\n\nspheres were dispersed in 100 ml of DI water while 1 ml of 2-M ammonia solution was added. Then 50 ml of solution containing 20 mg of Pt(NH\n\n)\n\n(NO\n\n)\n\nwas pumped into the suspension within 1 h. After stirring for another half an hour, the mixture was filtered. The Pt loading on SiO\n\nspheres was determined to be 0.2 wt% by ICP measurement.\nPorous SiO\n\nshell\nThe (Pt/CeO\n\n)@SiO\n\n(Extended Data \n) was prepared by a modified Stöber method\n\n; 500 mg of the as-prepared 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO\n\nwas dispersed in 300 ml of ethanol by ultrasonication. Then 2.5 ml of TEOS was added, and the solution was stirred for 4 h. Then 5 ml of ammonia (~25%–28%) and 20 ml of DI water were added to the slurry, which was stirred for another 4 h. Finally, the product was washed with ethanol and dried at 100 °C. For (Pt/SiO\n\n)@SiO\n\n, 150 mg of 0.2 wt% Pt/SiO\n\nspheres and 1.5 ml of TEOS were used in the synthesis.\n\nCu nanoparticles\nA specified amount of (Pt/CeO\n\n)@SiO\n\nor (Pt/SiO\n\n)@SiO\n\nwas added to 25 ml of DI water. The pH value of the solution was kept at 9 by adding Na\n\nCO\n\nsolution. Then Cu(NO\n\n)\n\nsolution was added dropwise to the above suspension. The target loading of Cu was 2 wt% in each sample. After ageing for 1 h, the products were filtered and dried at 70 °C overnight. The final products, denoted as Cu[(Pt/CeO\n\n)@SiO\n\n] or Cu[(Pt/SiO\n\n)@SiO\n\n], were in situ reduced in 20 ml min\n−1\nof 10% H\n\n/Ar at 400 °C for 3 h in preparation for DRIFTS and HAADF-STEM characterizations.\n\nCatalytic testing of the prepared catalysts\nThe CO oxidation reaction was conducted in a fixed-bed, plug-flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 30 mg of 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst was packed between two quartz wool plugs inside a quartz tube (inner diameter of 4 mm) for each test. Prior to catalytic reaction, the H\n\n-activated catalysts were pretreated with 10 ml min\n−1\nof 5% H\n\n/He at 300 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction temperature was ramped up at a rate of 1 °C min\n−1\n. The feed gas, containing 1 vol.% CO, and 4 vol.% O\n\nbalanced in He, passed through the catalyst bed at a flow rate of 10.0 ml min\n−1\n(corresponding to a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 20,000 ml (g\ncat\nh)\n−1\n). The outlet gas composition was measured with an online gas chromatograph (7890A, Agilent) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).\nThe specific reaction rate and apparent activation energy were measured as the catalyst was exposed to the gas composition stated above. During the kinetics experiments, the CO conversion was controlled to be less than 15% by adjustment of either the feed flow rate or catalyst mass.\nCharacterization instruments\nHAADF-STEM images were collected with a JEOL ARM-200F microscope equipped with a probe-forming aberration corrector operated at 200 kV to achieve a nominal image resolution of 0.08 nm. The backscattered electron images were obtained on a JEOL JXA-8530F electron microprobe. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. All reported electron microscopy images were raw images. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out with an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα as the excitation source. The loadings of Pt and Ce were determined with a ThermoFinnegan iCAP Q quadrupole ICP-MS with CCT (Collision Cell Technology), and Pd and Rh were determined with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Atomscan Advantage, Thermo Jarrell Ash). Samples were run in KED (kinetic energy discrimination) mode, with in-line aspiration of a multi-element internal standard. The BET surface areas were measured by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption method on a surface area and porosity analyser (Quantachrome NOVA 4000e apparatus). Before measurements, the samples were degassed at 180 °C for 6 h under vacuum. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku TTR-III theta-theta rotating anode X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 200 mA) with a step size of 0.02°. Raman spectra were collected with a JYLABRAM-HR spectrometer equipped with an integral microscope. DRIFTS experiments were carried out with samples in a diffuse reflectance reaction chamber (Harrick Scientific) equipped with ZnSe windows, mounted in a Praying Mantis diffuse reflection accessory (Harrick Scientific), and coupled to a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT-A) detector. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H\n\n-TPR) measurements were conducted on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments were carried at beamlines 4-1 and 9-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) and at the TPS 44A beamline of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. The storage ring energies and currents were 3 GeV and 500 mA, respectively. Photon energy selection was achieved with double-crystal Si monochromators at SSRL. A Si channel-cut crystal was used as the quick-scanning monochromator at NSRRC.\nCharacterization methods\nICP\nICP-MS measurements were performed to quantify the loadings (loading levels) of metal species on SiO\n\n. For a particular weight of Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst, Pt and Ce atoms were dissolved in freshly prepared aqua regia solution. Then the insoluble SiO\n\nwas washed and centrifuged three times with all the solution in a volumetric flask. The final concentrations of Pt and Ce were diluted to meet the calibration standards. The loading of CeO\nx\nwas calculated in terms of CeO\n\nunits. To verify that Pt atoms were selectively adsorbed by CeO\nx\nnanoglues, the CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nsupport was replaced by pure SiO\n\nin a typical synthesis procedure. Because the loading of Pt on the pure SiO\n\nwas expected to be much lower than that on the CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, larger amount of samples of Pt/SiO\n\nwere used for the ICP-MS measurement to assure that the concentration of Pt was in the range of the reference standards. The results are summarized in Extended Data \n.\nXPS\nFor XPS investigations of the high-temperature reduced 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, as-synthesized powder samples were reduced in 10% H\n\n/Ar at 500 °C for 1 h. The reactor vessel was then tightly sealed and transferred to a glove box. The catalyst powders were then transferred into the XPS sample holder within the glove box. The XPS sample holder was tightly sealed in the glove box to protect the catalysts from oxidation by air during transfer. After the sample preparation procedure, the XPS sample holder was placed in a vacuum transfer chamber and transferred to the XPS apparatus without sample exposure to air.\n\nHAADF imaging of CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nand Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nThe mesoporous SiO\n\nsupport has interconnected 3D pores and underwent considerable charging under electron beam illumination, making imaging of such materials challenging. In the HAADF images shown in Extended Data ,e\n, the adjacent regions could not be simultaneously imaged because atomic-resolution HAADF imaging is sensitive to height modulations of the mesoporous SiO\n\nsupport: CeO\nx\nclusters located at different sample heights would not be clearly revealed in the same HAADF image. Through-focus images were needed to observe clear features of the adjacent regions. Prior to calcination, the conforming coating of Ce species on the mesoporous SiO\n\nsupport made the SiO\n\npowders less susceptible to electron beam charging effects. After high-temperature calcination, however, the mesoporous SiO\n\nbecame charged under the influence of the electron beam, owing to the fact that the crystalline CeO\nx\nnanoclusters were isolated from each other. Because of the sample charging and electron-beam-induced effects, crystalline CeO\nx\nnanoclusters would usually be transformed quickly into amorphous species. For this reason, a low-dose STEM method was used to acquire STEM images of the sensitive CeO\nx\nnanoclusters. In some cases, a thin layer (<2 nm) of continuous carbon coating of the CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nor Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\npowders was used to reduce the sample charging and other electron-beam-induced effects.\nThe HAADF imaging is sensitive to the atomic number of the atoms in the sample and the sample thickness. For Pt atoms supported on well faceted CeO\n\n, it is possible to distinguish a Pt atom from columns of Ce atoms, because the image contrast can be considered to be proportional to\n$$\\frac{1}{{N}_{{\\rm{Ce}}}}<?RemoveMrow1?>{\\left(\\frac{{Z}_{{\\rm{Pt}}}}{{Z}_{{\\rm{Ce}}}}\\right)}^{2}<?RemoveMrow2?>\\approx \\frac{1.8}{{N}_{{\\rm{Ce}}}}$$\nwhere\nN\nCe\nrepresents the number of Ce atoms along the electron beam direction. Therefore, even if a single Pt atom is located on top of a 30-Ce-atom-thick CeO\n\ncolumn, the image contrast would still be  greater than 5%—and reliably detectable in digital HAADF images. However, in this special case, even when a thin layer of carbon coating was used to reduce electron-beam-induced effects and sample charging, low-dose STEM imaging conditions and fast image acquisition were needed to preserve the crystallinity of the electron-beam-sensitive CeO\nx\nnanoclusters. Such a low-dose approach greatly reduced the visibility of single Pt atoms. Furthermore, because the CeO\nx\nnanoclusters were extremely small and their surfaces were characterized by many steps or other types of surface defects, it became extremely difficult to reliably distinguish the contrast between a supported Pt atom from that of a supported Ce atom (or two Ce atoms). Depending on the specific location of the Pt atom, distinguishing the image contrast of a Pt atom from that of two or more Ce atoms is an impossible task with the currently available technology. All these complications made it impossible to unambiguously identify the presence of Pt single atoms on the CeO\nx\nclusters by the STEM-HAADF imaging technique. Nor did EDXS (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and EELS (electron energy-loss spectroscopy) techniques provide useful results, primarily owing to the electron-beam-induced effects.\nCO DRIFTS\nIn a typical experiment, the infrared cell was partly filled with inert KBr powder, followed by catalyst packed onto the KBr support. All the gases that flowed through the cell flowed downward through the catalyst bed. For fresh catalysts, a pretreatment at 300 °C with 10% O\n\n/Ar was conducted for 30 min. The flowing gas was then switched to He, and the background spectra were recorded at 50 °C characterizing the as-synthesized 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst. CO adsorption was conducted by flowing 15 ml min\n−1\nof 10% CO/Ar and 30 ml min\n−1\nof He for 20 min. The CO desorption spectra were recorded following a He purge at a flow rate of 30 ml min\n−1\nto remove gas-phase CO from the cell. When the sample to be characterized was Pt\nx\nO\ny\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, no further oxidative pretreatment was carried out. The CO adsorption experiment was conducted at 100 °C by flowing 10 ml min\n−1\nof 10% CO/Ar, 10 ml min\n−1\nof 10% O\n\n/Ar, and 20 ml min\n−1\nof He. Then the O\n\nflow was stopped to allow investigation of the CO adsorption behaviour on Pt\nx\nO\ny\nclusters.\nThe in situ H\n\nreduction treatments were conducted with the sample in the cell—fresh catalyst samples were loaded. The catalysts were heated to the target temperatures in flowing 10% O\n\n/Ar, and then the gas was switched to 10% H\n\n/Ar. During the reduction treatment at 300–600 °C, 20 ml min\n−1\nof 10% H\n\n/Ar flowed through the cell for various periods. The cell was then cooled down to the desired temperatures with the sample in the H\n\nenvironment. The flowing gas was then switched to He and backgrounds of the Pt-containing, Pd-containing and Rh-containing catalysts were recorded at 100 °C, 25 °C and 180 °C, respectively. CO adsorption was investigated as the sample was exposed to 10% CO/Ar flowing at 15 ml min\n−1\nand He flowing at 30 ml min\n−1\nfor 20 min. The CO desorption spectra were recorded following a He purge at a flow rate of 30 ml min\n−1\nto remove gas-phase CO from the cell. The measurement process was conducted in such a way to avoid oxidation of Pt species.\nSimulation of CO IR spectra\nTo predict possible adsorption configurations and vibrational frequencies of CO on harshly reduced (above 500 °C) Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) code\n\n. The projector augmented-wave method (PAW) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional were used to deal with the electron–ion interactions and exchange correlation, respectively\n\n,\n\n. DFT+U correction (\nU\neff\n= 5 eV for Ce) was considered to treat the strongly correlated 4\nf\nelectron\n\n. The van der Waals interactions were described using the empirical DFT+D3 method to improve the accuracy of representation of CO adsorption\n\n. The gamma point was set for the total energy calculations together with a cut-off energy of 400 eV for the plane-wave basis. A vacuum space larger than 10 Å was added in each direction to avoid the interactions between each cluster model. During the structure optimization and frequency analysis, all the atoms were relaxed until the force on each ion was less than 0.02 eV Å\n−1\n.\nTo obtain plausible structures of harshly reduced Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed. First, a Pt-doped model cluster (Pt\n\n/Ce\n\nO\n\n) with local coordination environment consistent with the EXAFS results of the as-synthesized Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n(crystalline) was established. Then the canonical ensemble (NVT) with the Nosé–Hoover thermostat was implemented in the AIMD simulations for a period of 2 ps at 873 K to give relatively stable structures. The generated configurations were further optimized using standard DFT calculations. The reduced Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\nwas represented by a model (Pt\n\n/Ce\n\nO\n\n) constructed by removing five outermost low-coordinated O atoms from Pt\n\n/Ce\n\nO\n\n. AIMD simulation was further performed for a more stable structure. The Pt single atoms coordinated with 2–3 oxygen ligands are probably located atop the reduced CeO\nx\ncluster. The calculated vibrational frequency of gaseous CO was 2,127 cm\n−1\n, which is 47 cm\n−1\nlower than our experimental value (2,174 cm\n−1\n). The agreement is satisfactory, but to keep the theoretical values more nearly comparable to our experimental results, we applied a shift of 47 cm\n−1\nto the calculated vibrational frequencies of adsorbed CO on Pt\n\n/Ce\n\nO\n\ncluster and Pt\n\n/Ce\n\nO\n\n(\n).\nXAS measurements\nEx situ EXAFS spectra were used to characterize the Pt-containing sample supported on CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nat the Pt L\nIII\nedge. We used a highly sensitive fluorescence detection technique\n\n, carried out with a 30-element solid-state Ge detector at SSRL beamline 4-1 and with a 100-element solid-state Ge detector at beamline 9-3 with each sample pressed into a pellet at 25 °C. In situ XANES spectra were collected at beamline 9-3 at SSRL by using the 100-element solid-state Ge detector at the Pt L\nIII\nedge. Approximately 50 mg of catalyst sample was loaded into a flow-through cell and held in place with quartz wool; a Kapton capillary cell (inside diameter = 2.8 mm), connected to a treatment gas line\n\nwas used to collect in situ XANES spectra during treatment of the as-synthesized Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nin 10% H\n\n/He flowing at a rate of 20 ml min\n−1\nas the cell temperature was ramped from 25 to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C min\n−1\nfollowed by a dwell of 60 min at 300 °C. The Pt\nx\nO\ny\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst was also investigated at the TPS 44A beamline of the NSRRC. The data were collected in fluorescence mode by using a seven-element silicon drift detector, and a standard Pt foil was used as reference for the energy calibration.\nAnalysis of the EXAFS data was carried out with Athena and XDAP. Athena, part of the Demeter package, was used to merge and deglitch the data, and XDAP was used for background subtraction, normalization and conversion of the data into an EXAFS function file. Reference backscattering phase shifts were calculated from crystallographic data determined with FEFF7. The Pt–O, Pt–O\nlong\n, and Pt–O–Pt contributions were calculated on the basis of the structural parameters of PtO\n\n; the Pt–Ce contribution was calculated on the basis of the structural parameters of the PtCe alloy\n\n. The number of parameters used in the fitting was less than the statistically justified number, computed with the Nyquist theorem,\nn\n= 2Δ\nk\nΔ\nr\n/π + 2 (where Δ\nk\nand Δ\nr\n, respectively, are the wavevector range and distance interval in the real space range used in the fitting).\nData fitting was based on an iterative process with a difference-file technique to determine a model comparing the overall fits and fits of individual shells as well. The model was chosen as the best-fitting model when the\nk\n\n- and\nk\n\n-weighted EXAFS data, Fourier-transformed data, and Fourier-transformed data characterizing each shell contribution were overall in best agreement with the calculated fits. Quality of fits was evaluated by the value of ‘goodness of fit’, defined below:\n$$\\text{Goodness of fit}\\,=\\,\\frac{\\nu }{{\\rm{NPTS}}(\\nu -{N}_{{\\rm{free}}})}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{{\\rm{NPTS}}}{\\left(\\frac{{\\chi }_{\\exp ,i}-{\\chi }_{{\\rm{model}},i}}{{\\sigma }_{\\exp ,i}}\\right)}^{2},$$\nwhere\nχ\nexp\nand\nχ\nmodel\nare the experimental and calculated EXAFS functions, respectively;\nσ\nexp\nis the error in the experimental results;\nν\nis the number of independent data points in the fit range;\nN\nfree\nis the number of free parameters, and NPTS is the number of data points in the fit range.\nWe emphasize that we examined the data characterizing the as-synthesized 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst to check for Pt–Pt contributions, but found no evidence of any; thus, the reported fit includes no contributions of Pt–Pt shells from those that might have been present characterizing either metallic platinum (platinum nanoparticles) (with a Pt–Pt absorber–backscatterer distance of 2.81 Å) or PtO\n\n(which would give a Pt–O–Pt contribution at a distance of about 3.19 Å), consistent with the presence of atomically dispersed platinum. The coordination number of the Pt–O shell in the model without a Pt–Pt contribution was found to be 4.5 ± 0.5 with a length of 1.97 ± 0.02 Å (which is a bonding length), consistent with the EXAFS analyses reported elsewhere for site-isolated platinum anchored on ceria and on iron oxide\n\n,\n\n. A metal–O\nlong\nshell has been observed for numerous samples comparable to ours, for example, for atomically dispersed platinum supported on the potassium form of zeolite LTL\n\n. Such a shell is not easily identified with any particular metal–oxygen contribution; rather, because of the complexity of the surface structures, it is an average representing the metal atom near support surface oxygen atoms to which it is not chemically bonded. Our observation of a Pt–backscatterer contribution associated with the Ce atoms of the support is as expected for an atomically dispersed platinum species on the ceria support. The result is consistent, for example, with results characterizing atomically dispersed platinum species anchored on FeO\nx\n\n. We emphasize, however, that the fit of the Pt–Ce shell characterizing our data does not provide precise information, instead representing an average of various absorber–backscatterer contributions characteristic of isolated Pt atoms on a heterogeneous surface with various Pt–Ce distances; it is beyond the capabilities of EXAFS spectroscopy to resolve these interactions at distances from 0.5 to 2.3 Å. We thus infer that there are some backscatterer contributions associated with the complexity of the CeO\nx\nsurface that we could not resolve in our fitting technique.\nThe analysis characterizing the H\n\n-activated 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst showed that the coordination number of the Pt–O shell (first shell) fell to 3.2 ± 0.3 as the bond distance remained nearly constant at 1.99 ± 0.02 Å. The EXAFS data indicate that the H\n\n-activation process removed oxygen ligands from the isolated platinum atoms and modified their local coordination environment. There was no evidence of a Pt–Pt scattering path in either the as-synthesized or the H\n\n-activated 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalyst. The best-fit models representing both the as-synthesized and H\n\n-activated 0.4 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\ncatalysts include three shells each, Pt–O, Pt–O\nlong\n, and Pt–O–Ce, and the data and the fits are shown in Extended Data –j\nand Extended Data –p\n, respectively. The fits were found to be the best of the candidate models in terms of quality of fit evaluated by the values of ‘goodness of fit’ and also the parameters that make good chemical sense.\nThe fitting of the data characterizing the Pt\nx\nO\ny\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n(4 wt% Pt relative to CeO\nx\n) catalyst indicates the following absorber–backscatterer contributions: Pt–O, Pt–O–Pt, and Pt–O–Ce. The best three-shell EXAFS fitting results are shown in Extended Data \n. The EXAFS parameters given in Extended Data –p\nindicate that for the Pt\nx\nO\ny\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nsample, on average, the coordination number of the Pt–O shell (first shell) is 2.7 ± 0.3, at a bonding distance, 2.00 ± 0.02 Å. A longer Pt−Pt scattering path, characterized by a non-bonding distance of 3.21 ± 0.02 Å, was characterized by a coordination number of 2.0 ± 0.2, consistent with the presence of small Pt\nx\nO\ny\nspecies. The data did not show evidence of a Pt–Pt scattering path. Such three-shell EXAFS fits are close to those reported for small Pt\nx\nO\ny\nclusters\n\nsupported on CeO\n\n, strongly suggesting the existence of small Pt\nx\nO\ny\nclusters in the Pt\nx\nO\ny\n/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nsample.\nDetermination of physical property parameters of catalysts\nEstimated surface area of CeO\nx\nAccording to the average sizes of CeO\nx\nnanoclusters determined from the HAADF images, loadings of Pt and Ce from ICP-MS results, and the BET surface area of Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, we calculated various parameters characterizing the nanostructured CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\n. We use a cuboidal model here for CeO\nx\nnanoclusters. The average dimension of these CeO\nx\nclusters was taken to be 2 nm with a volume (\n\\({V}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{x}}\\)\n) of 8 nm\n\n. The loading (\nX\nCe\n) of Ce atoms was taken to be 10 wt%. The surface area (SA) of Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n\nwas measured to be 267 m\n\ng\n−1\n. Each unit cell of the CeO\nx\ncontains four cerium atoms. The mass of one CeO\nx\ncluster is estimated by\n$${m}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{x}}=\\left(4\\frac{{V}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{x}}}{{V}_{{\\rm{cell}}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{{M}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{2}}}{{N}_{{\\rm{A}}}}\\right)\\approx 5.8\\times {10}^{-20}\\,{\\rm{g}}.$$\nWhere the molar mass\n\\({M}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{2}}=172\\;\\text{g}\\;{\\text{mol}}^{-1}\\)\n,\nV\ncell\n= 0.157 nm\n\nand\nN\nA\n= 6.02 × 10\n\n. The surface area of one CeO\nx\ncluster with five exposed faces is\n\\({{\\rm{SA}}}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{x}}=2\\;{\\rm{nm}}\\times 2\\;{\\rm{nm}}\\times 5=20\\;{{\\rm{nm}}}^{2}\\)\n; the specific surface area (SSA) of CeO\nx\nclusters is estimated to be\n\\({\\text{SSA}}_{{\\text{CeO}}_{x}}={\\text{SA}}_{{\\text{CeO}}_{x}}/{m}_{{\\text{CeO}}_{x}}=345\\;{{\\rm{m}}}^{2}\\;{{\\rm{g}}}^{-1}\\)\n.\nEstimated surface area of CeO\n\nin CeO\n\nNPs/SiO\n\nThe shape of the CeO\n\nNPs can be roughly regarded as cuboidal with a dimension of 8 nm. The volume of one CeO\n\nNP is thus estimated as\n\\({V}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{x}}=512\\;{{\\rm{nm}}}^{3}\\)\n; the mass of one CeO\n\nNP is\n\\({M}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{2}}=3.7\\times 1{0}^{-18}\\;{\\rm{g}}\\)\n; the CeO\n\nNPs are loosely positioned on SiO\n\nso that their contact area with the support can be ignored. Surface area of one CeO\n\nNP is\n\\({{\\rm{SA}}}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{2}}=384\\;{{\\rm{nm}}}^{2}\\)\n; specific surface area of CeO\n\nNPs is\n\\({{\\rm{SSA}}}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{2}}=103\\;{{\\rm{m}}}^{2}\\;{{\\rm{g}}}^{-1}\\)\n.\nEstimated Pt atom number density on CeO\nx\nspecies\nFor the 0.4 wt% Pt\n\n/CeO\nx\n, the Pt atom number density on CeO\nx\nis estimated by\n\\(\\rho ={X}_{{\\rm{Pt}}}{N}_{{\\rm{A}}}/{M}_{{\\rm{Pt}}}{\\text{SSA}}_{{{\\rm{CeO}}}_{x}}=0.036\\;{{\\rm{nm}}}^{-2}\\)\n, where the Pt molar mass\nM\nPt\n= 195 g mol\n−1\nand\nX\nPt\nis the wt% of Pt loading.

These calculated results are summarized in Extended Data \n.\nExtended results and discussions\nStabilization strategies\nThe most critical challenge to practical applications of single-atom catalysts is to prevent sintering of metal atoms (that is, formation of clusters and nanoparticles) during a desired catalytic reaction, especially under reducing environments at elevated temperatures\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Substantial efforts have been made to anchor supported single metal atoms, for example, by filling cation vacancies to form chemical bonds\n\n,\n\n, step trapping\n\n,\n\n, edge-anchoring\n\n, engineering of support defects to form strong bonds\n\n,\n\n, use of surface functional groups\n\n,\n\n,\n\nand introduction of strong metal–support interactions\n\n. All of these approaches have focused on manipulating the support structure or chemistry to anchor isolated single metal atoms through strong metal–support interactions or interactions between the supported single metal atoms and surface functional groups. These anchoring strategies, however, may not be effective for reactions taking place under strongly reducing and/or oxidizing environments at elevated temperatures. For example, H\n\nreduction of metal oxide-supported metal atoms at temperatures >200 °C may cause sintering of metal species regardless of the nature of the metal oxide supports (whether they are reducible or nonreducible)\n\n. Although H\n\nactivation is frequently used for supported metal particle catalysts, the heretofore unavoidable sintering of supported metal atoms during H\n\nactivation makes it difficult to evaluate the true catalytic performance of supported metal atoms.\nThe strategies for stabilization of supported metal particles and clusters, illustrated, for example, by formation of chemical bonds at metal–support interfaces\n\n, encapsulation by porous structures\n\n, and incorporation of additives on supports with strong metal–additive interactions\n\n,\n\n, are not readily transferred to stabilizing isolated single metal atoms. Alternative approaches are needed to mitigate or confine the movement of metal atoms during a targeted catalytic reaction.\nExtended Data –e\nshows HAADF images of the Ce–SiO\n\nprecursor. The Ce-containing species conformally and uniformly coated the mesoporous SiO\n\nsurfaces, and there was no evidence of large Ce-containing particles after the SEA process. Owing to the 3D mesoporous structure of the SiO\n\nsupport, it needs several images at different electron beam focus values to reveal the full picture of the conformal Ce coating as demonstrated in the images of the same region (Extended Data –e\n), which were obtained with defocus value differences of ~30 nm. Prior to high-temperature calcination, the Ce atoms were atomically dispersed on the SiO\n\n. Extended Data –i\nshows that the CeO\nx\nnanoclusters were uniformly and conformally ‘glued’ onto the mesoporous SiO\n\nsurfaces. The CeO\nx\nnanoclusters were isolated from each other. The average dimensions of the as-synthesized CeO\nx\nnanoclusters were measured to be 1.8 nm × 2.1 nm.\nExtended Data \nshows characterizations of various supports. In the case of the conventional impregnation method, SiO\n\nmight not interact strongly with the Ce species. After being dried, Ce-containing species formed large agglomerates. In pure CeO\n\npowders, well crystalized CeO\n\nNPs (~17 nm from XRD, determined by the Scherrer equation) connected together to form large agglomerates. The CeO\n\n{111} lattice spacing was used as an internal calibration standard for measuring the CeO\nx\n{111} spacings (Extended Data \n). To increase the measurement precision and to obtain statistically meaningful data, many sets of {111} lattice fringes were evaluated. Intensity line-scan profiles were used to calculate the corresponding lattice spacings. The average interplanar spacing of the {111} planes in the CeO\nx\nnanoclusters was measured to be 0.33 nm, a value markedly greater than the 0.31 nm characterizing the large CeO\n\nnanoparticles—and indicating a considerable lattice expansion of the {111} planes in the CeO\nx\nnanoclusters. Because of their small sizes, strong lattice distortion, and high concentrations of oxygen vacancies, the ultrasmall (<2 nm) CeO\nx\nnanoclusters were much more easily reduced than the larger CeO\n\nNPs (Extended Data \n).\nExtended Data \nshows the ICP-MS results of Pt loadings in the final catalysts.

The cell voltage showed an immediate increase with the injection of CO gas. The CO injection gas consists of 13.9% CO\n\n, 4% CO and 82.1% O\n\n. The error bars represent at least three independent tests.\nFull size image\nUnder a constant ORR/OER electrolysis current, we can obtain the CO\n\n-capture rate, which is equivalent to the CO\n\ncrossover rate, by measuring the CO\n\nflow rate out of the PSE layer using water-displacement and titration methods for both the gas-phase and dissolved CO\n\n(\n\nMethods\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). This CO\n\ndissolution can be avoided in practical operations by continuously recycling the deionized water stream. The CO\n\nbubble formation within the PSE layer was found to have little impact on the middle-layer pressure or the device operational stability (Supplementary \n). Furthermore, the recovered gas product was confirmed to be high-purity CO\n\nthrough gas chromatography analysis (up to 99.7% without considering water vapour; Supplementary \n), allowing for direct integration with downstream utilization or storage processes without the typical energy-intensive secondary purification processes. No CO\n\nreduction gas or liquid products were detected during this carbon-capture process (Supplementary \n). As shown in \n, with 13.9% CO\n\nconcentration, the CO\n\n-capture rate increased almost linearly with the ORR current density ranging from 10 to 500 mA cm\n−2\n. By estimating the slope of the CO\n\n-capture (or crossover) rate as a function of the ORR current, we found that, for every two-electron transfer during which two OH\n−\nions were generated, there was one CO\n\nmolecule captured, suggesting that the CO\n\ncrossover is mainly through the carbonate ion instead of bicarbonate because of the high local interfacial pH. This conclusion is supported by the well-matched CO\n\n-capture rates with the theoretical guideline, which assumes 100% carbonate crossover and is consistent with observations reported in previous studies\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Therefore, here we defined the carbonate Faradaic efficiency (FE\ncarbonate\n) to better evaluate the carbon-capture efficiencies under different reaction conditions (\n\nMethods\n). The FE\ncarbonate\nwas maintained over 90% across a wide range of cell currents under 13.9% CO\n\n, suggesting a high utilization efficiency of generated OH\n−\nions. However, at high current densities, FE\ncarbonate\nshowed a slight decrease owing to the competition between the rate of carbonate formation and OH\n−\nmigration. There were sufficient CO\n\nmolecules around the catalyst–membrane interface at low current densities to react rapidly with the generated OH\n−\nions before they were transported across the membrane by means of carbonate ions form. For high ORR currents, a large number of OH\n−\nions were generated, depleting the surrounding CO\n\nmolecules at a fast rate. This limits the mass diffusion of CO\n\nand allows some OH\n−\nions to move directly across the AEM without reacting with CO\n\nmolecules, resulting in lowered FEs. Even with lower FE\ncarbonate\n, our solid-electrolyte reactor delivered an impressive carbon-capture rate of 3.34 ml min\n−1\ncm\n−2\n(or 0.137 mmol\nCO2\nmin\n−1\ncm\n−2\n) at 500 mA cm\n−2\n, which is equivalent to a rate of about 86.7 kg CO\n\nday\n−1\nm\n−2\n. According to the reaction mechanism discussed above, we can anticipate that the maximal current density required to maintain high FEs would decrease with decreasing CO\n\nconcentrations in the input gas owing to limited mass diffusion. This was confirmed by the 8.6% and 4.6% CO\n\ntests, in which the maximal operation current to maintain over 80% FE\ncarbonate\ndecreased to 400 mA cm\n−2\nand 200 mA cm\n−2\n, respectively ,d\n). Please note that the choice of ion conduction in the solid electrolyte plays a critical role in determining the cell voltage, particularly under high current density (Supplementary \n).\nIn principle, because ORR catalysis and CO\n\ncapture are independent processes, the O\n\npartial pressure should only affect the cell activity and not its carbon-capture rates or FEs\n\n,\n\n. As shown by the\nI\n–\nV\ncurve comparison in \n, the solid-electrolyte reactor with air + 13.9% CO\n\npresented similar ORR/OER electrolysis activities to that of O\n\n+ 13.9% CO\n\nat low currents, but required higher voltages at higher currents owing to its lower O\n\npartial pressure. However, this cell-voltage difference did not affect the current efficiencies or CO\n\n-capture rates \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). To further test the carbon-capture capability and adaptability of our solid-electrolyte device, we lowered the feed CO\n\nlevels to 6,200 and 2,950 ppm while evaluating the cell performance (Supplementary \n). At low CO\n\nconcentrations, the main limitation to the carbon-capture rate is the mass transport of CO\n\nfrom the inlet flow to the catalyst–membrane interface, which is a common challenge for scaling up of all carbon-capture methods. As shown in \n, the CO\n\n-capture efficiency was maintained above 80% within the current range 1–10 mA cm\n−2\nbut rapidly decreased to around 50–60% when reaching 20–30 mA cm\n−2\n. This FE decrease is because of the mass-transfer limit of CO\n\ngas under this low-concentration condition, which became more prominent when the input CO\n\nconcentration was further reduced to 2,950 ppm \n). In this case, the FE\ncarbonate\ndecreased to about 55% under 10 mA cm\n−2\ncurrent compared with 90% in the case of 6,200 ppm. The observed FE trends imply that the operational current of the carbon-capture cell can be adjusted to suit different application scenarios, depending on the input CO\n\nconcentrations, while still maintaining high electron efficiencies.\nIn practical scenarios, CO impurities are widely present in industrial flue gas owing to incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, which could greatly affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst because of poisoning effects\n\n,\n\n. As shown in \n, the cell voltage under a fixed current of 100 mA cm\n−2\nshowed an immediate increase when a CO stream was mixed with the cathode gas input and continuously rose by about 300 mV within 10 h operation, suggesting a fast degradation of Pt/C ORR activity. The impurity poisoning effects on the Pt catalyst, as well as Pt scarcity and high cost, could limit the practical application of our solid-electrolyte carbon-capture device.\nThe impacts of different ORR catalysts\nOne unique advantage of our carbon-capture device is the flexibility in using different ORR and OER catalysts. Replacing the expensive Pt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant ORR catalysts can substantially reduce the materials cost; alternative ORR catalysts with different material properties could help mitigate the CO poisoning effect observed on Pt/C. One promising candidate is the recently developed transition-metal single-atom catalyst (SAC), such as Fe or Co single-atomic sites coordinated in N-doped carbon\n\n,\n\n. These SACs presented similar ORR performance to commercial Pt/C with high resistance to CO poisoning owing to the weak interaction between CO and the transition-metal centre\n\n. Here we used Co-SAC as a representative ORR catalyst to investigate these possible advantages compared with Pt/C. Our Co-SAC was synthesized on the basis of a hard-template method developed in our previous study, which guarantees high porosity and uniform distribution of metal single-atomic sites on the carbon matrix\n\n(\n\nMethods\n). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and other characterization tools suggest an interconnected 3D porous structure of Co-SAC reversely templating from the SiO\n\nnanoparticle templates \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirmed the atomic dispersion of Co as shown in ,c\n, in which only the Co–N coordination (located at around 1.4 Å) was observed in the spectrum and no Co–Co interactions (about 2.15 Å)\n\n.\n\n,\nc\n, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and EXAFS spectra of the Co K-edge in Co-SAC.

The CO\n\nconcentration decreased from 13.9% of the input to around 3,000 ppm of output under a gas flow rate of 5 sccm, suggesting a 98% carbon-removal efficiency. The error bars represent at least three independent tests.\nFull size image\nWe first evaluated the carbon-capture performance of our Co-SAC under a standard 13.9% CO\n\nconcentration. The\nI\n–\nV\ncurve showed a similar catalytic activity and FE\ncarbonate\ncompared with Pt/C catalyst \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n), suggesting the feasibility of replacing Pt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant materials. Differences became evident when we tuned the CO\n\nconcentration to 6,200 ppm, at which mass transport plays a more critical role in determining carbon-capture performance. As shown in \n, the Co-SAC maintained a high FE of more than 80% until 20 mA cm\n−2\n, under which the Pt/C counterpart only achieved roughly 60% FE. The carbon-capture rate of Co-SAC was 0.12 ml min\n−1\ncm\n−2\nunder 20 mA cm\n−2\n, suggesting a more than 30% improvement compared with Pt/C (about 0.09 ml min\n−1\ncm\n−2\n). The improvement ratio was further enhanced to around 50% under 30 mA cm\n−2\n. Our Co-SAC can deliver 40 mA m\n−2\ncurrent density with 60% FE and a carbon-capture rate of 0.18 ml min\n−1\ncm\n−2\nor 4.8 kg\nCO2\nday\n−1\nm\n−2\n, suggesting a highly efficient carbon capture considering this low-CO\n\n-concentration source. Different from Pt/C catalyst with the active sites densely packed on the surface of Pt nanoparticles, Co-SAC has uniformly dispersed active sites across the whole carbon matrix, which enables a more uniform generation of OH\n−\nions for a more efficient CO\n\ncapture, especially when the CO\n\nmass diffusion is limited (Supplementary \n). We further explored our Co-SAC and PSE device carbon-capture limit by testing its direct air capture (DAC) performance (400 ppm CO\n\n;\n\nMethods\n). As expected, the ORR current density to maintain high FE\ncarbonate\nwas decreased because of the limited carbon mass diffusions under DAC conditions (Supplementary \n). Our reactor delivered almost 100% FE\ncarbonate\nunder a 0.5 mA cm\n−2\nORR current. This represents a carbon-capture rate of 1.14 mg m\n−2\ns\n−1\n, comparable with the state-of-the-art DAC demonstration of about 1 mg m\n−2\ns\n−1\n(\n). Future improvements, including lower-cost catalysts, electrodes and ion-exchange membranes, are needed to justify the scalability of our PSE reactor for DAC application when compared with decoupled electrochemical/chemical reactions, in which electrolysis could be operated under high current densities. Our mass-transport simulation model and further DAC experiments on the impacts of pressure and catalyst-layer thickness lay the groundwork for different tuning knobs to enhance the device performance in the future (Supplementary Discussion\n\n, Supplementary \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n).\nThe CO injection experiment shown in \nsuggests the high resistance of our Co-SAC to CO poisoning resulting from the weak interactions between the metal single-atomic sites and CO molecules\n\n. No notable changes were observed in the cell voltage and FEs (>90%) when CO or other toxic gas (such as NO and SO\n\n) was injected into the input gas stream (Supplementary \n). The potential for practical carbon-capture application was further demonstrated by the high stability of Co-SAC in our solid-electrolyte device \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), in which the cell voltage and FE remained unchanged during the 72-h continuous carbon-capture operation under a fixed current density of 100 mA cm\n−2\n.\nTo make our study more practical, instead of using the above CO\n\n–O\n\nor CO\n\n–air mixtures, we prepared simulated flue gas (13.9% CO\n\n, 7.8% O\n\n, 76.3% N\n\nand 2.0% H\n\nO) as the gas input to our solid-electrolyte device. A tandem reactor system, with two identical solid-electrolyte cells but operated under two-stage current densities, was designed to deliver both high carbon-removal efficiencies and high FEs \n). To avoid the depletion of O\n\nin flue gas owing to its relatively low concentration, we recirculated the O\n\nstream generated through OER at the anode, which is the same amount of consumed O\n\nthrough ORR at the cathode, back to the flue gas stream. By holding the cell currents constant but gradually decreasing the flue gas input flow rate, the carbon-removal efficiency continued to increase. At an input flow rate of 5 ml min\n−1\n, the remaining CO\n\nconcentration in the tail gas decreased to only 3,000 ppm, representing a 98% carbon-removal efficiency while maintaining an impressive overall FE\ncarbonate\nof 75% \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n).\nApproaches to improving capture efficiency\nPrevious electrochemical CO\n\n-capture studies sometimes reported carbon-capture energy efficiencies based on half-cell reaction performance without considering ohmic drops in practical devices, ideal scenarios with certain assumptions (such as assuming full conversion of alkaline solutions into bicarbonate during CO\n\nabsorption) or without considering energy uses associated with steps other than electrochemistry (such as gas–alkaline contact)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. This may result in substantially underestimated energy consumption, especially under industrially relevant capture rates or low CO\n\nconcentrations. The performance of our solid-electrolyte device can reflect more practical values of energy consumption for future carbon-capture implementation, as it was evaluated in a full-cell device and included the entire carbon-capture process (CO\n\nabsorption and release) without making assumptions. Our carbon-capture energy consumption starts from about 150 kJ per mol\nCO2\n(0.8 V onset voltage) and gradually increases with increased carbon-capture rates (Supplementary \n). We believe that there is still plenty of room to further improve the carbon-capture energy effectiveness \n) and several potential strategies are presented as examples for future improvements. First, the thickness of the solid-electrolyte layer has not yet been optimized for smaller ohmic drops and better cell voltages. By decreasing the electrolyte-layer thickness from 2.5 mm to 1.5 mm, we were able to reduce cell impedance and conserve approximately 200 mV of cell voltage under 100 mA cm\n−2\ncurrent while maintaining similar carbon-capture FEs ,c\n). The thickness of the middle layer can be further reduced using more advanced machining tools or 3D printing technologies for better cell voltages and higher energy efficiencies. We would like to emphasize that the PSE is an indispensable part of our carbon-capture device even with an ultrathin middle layer (Supplementary \n).\n\n-capture electrolyser with possible improvement strategies, including decreasing the thickness of the PSE layer to reduce the ohmic drop, using facile redox couples for better reaction kinetics and different ion crossover for better electron efficiencies.\nb\n,\nI\n–\nV\ncurves of solid-electrolyte reactor with different PSE layer thicknesses (1.5 mm versus 2.5 mm). The inset shows the improved cell resistance after thickness reduction.\nc\n, The carbon-capture rates were not affected when the PSE layer thickness was reduced.\nd\n, Reaction mechanism of improved electron efficiency with the co-generation of H\n\nO\n2.\ne\n, The FEs of H\n\nO\n\non Ni-SAC during carbon capture in our solid-electrolyte reactor.\nf\n, The corresponding CO\n\n-capture performance on Ni-SAC showed a marked improvement compared with 4e\n−\n-ORR catalysts (averaged value from Pt/C and Co-SAC), suggesting a different carbon-crossover mechanism.\ng\n,  A linear relationship between the FE of H\n\nO\n\nand electron efficiency further confirms the proposed carbon-crossover mechanism as indicated by the theoretical line.\nh\n, Techno-economic assessment of carbon-capture cost based on the current reactor performance, enhanced ohmic drop and electron efficiency, and future improvements, such as more facile redox couples, thinner PSE layers and so on. The error bars represent at least three independent tests.\nFull size image\nSecond, the carbon-crossover efficiencies can be improved by means of the formation of different types of anion. As discussed above, we believe that the carbon crossover is through the carbonate ions, which require two-electron transfer per captured CO\n\nmolecule (0.5 CO\n\nper e\n−\n). One possible alternative to improving the electron efficiency is establishing the CO\n\n–H\n\nO\n\nequilibrium\n\n. Similar to the CO\n\n–OH\n−\nreaction in the water system, CO\n\ncan readily react with the HO\n\n−\nanion from H\n\nO\n\nto form percarbonate (HCO\n\n−\n)\n\n. If we replace the 4e\n−\n-ORR catalyst in our solid-electrolyte reactor with a 2e\n−\n-ORR catalyst\n\n, we may obtain a maximal 50% increase in electron efficiencies. With every two-electron transfer, one OH\n−\nand one HO\n\n−\ncould form, which can transport 1.5 CO\n\ngas molecules across the AEM (0.75 CO\n\nper e\n−\n; \n). To validate this hypothesis, we used the Ni-SAC with a reasonable H\n\nO\n\nselectivity in our solid-electrolyte reactor for carbon-capture tests \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). As shown in \n, the carbon-capture rates on Ni-SAC suggested a notable increase compared with 4e\n−\n-ORR catalysts demonstrated above. Under 100 mA cm\n−2\ncurrent density, the 4e\n−\n-ORR catalyst presented a carbon-capture rate of around 0.7 ml min\n−1\ncm\n−2\n, whereas the Ni-SAC delivered a rate of 1.05 ml min\n−1\ncm\n−2\n. The increased carbon-capture rates were carefully confirmed by excluding the possibility of O\n\ngas bubbles from H\n\nO\n\nself-decomposition in the PSE layer or any impacts of H\n\nO\n\non titrations (Supplementary Discussion\n\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). By calculating the number of CO\n\nmolecules captured per electron transferred, instead of using the above-defined FE\ncarbonate\nresulting from the multianion crossover mechanism involved, a promising 0.71 CO\n\nper e\n−\nwas achieved under 100 mA cm\n−2\n, compared with 0.47 CO\n\nper e\n−\nin the case of 4e\n−\n-ORR \n). Using other 2e\n−\n-ORR catalysts, including oxidized carbon black (OCB) and Fe-SAC (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), we showed that the carbon-capture electron efficiency linearly scales with H\n\nO\n\nselectivity under the same current density, further demonstrating the improvement of HO\n\n−\nions in transporting CO\n\nmolecules \n). We can also exclude the possibility of bicarbonate crossover in the case of H\n\nO\n\n, which could also improve the electron efficiencies (Supplementary Discussion\n\n).\nThe improvements in cell voltages and electron efficiencies discussed above can further reduce the carbon-capture cost of our device. A techno-economic analysis based on previously reported models and the performance of our device (Figs.\n\nand\n\n) suggests a base cost of about $83 per ton of captured CO\n\n(refs.\n\n,\n\n) \n, Supplementary \n, Supplementary Discussion\n\nand Supplementary \n). By taking into consideration the demonstrated improvements, including a thinner PSE layer \n) and higher electron efficiencies \n), the estimated cost can be reduced to about $58 per ton and can be more attractive if the value of generated H\n\nO\n\nwas included. Considering this very initial study with each component to be further improved and optimized in future research, our solid-electrolyte carbon-capture reactor represents a competitive, promising and sustainable strategy for carbon management. For example, we can switch to other facile redox couples in different application scenarios, such as hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) or organic and inorganic molecular redox couples, to further reduce the overpotentials. Further improvements of the ohmic drops of the reactor can be expected with a thinner middle layer and more conductive solid-electrolyte particles. Other operation parameters, such as temperature for better reaction kinetics and pressure for better mass transport, could also be implemented for different application scenarios (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). The mentioned improvements could bring the carbon-capture cost down to about $33 per ton.\nConclusion\nGiven various electrochemical redox reactions available with proton–electron coupling processes (HER/HOR, quinone redox couples, flow battery redox couples and so on), our solid-electrolyte reactor sets up a versatile carbon-capture platform that could be implemented in many practical scenarios in the future. It is worth noting that many electrochemical redox couples, such as HER/HOR, present much better reaction kinetics and lower overpotentials than the OER/ORR couple we demonstrated in this work, which can substantially reduce the cell-operation voltage and improve the carbon-capture efficiencies. Various cell and operation parameters, such as the thickness of the solid-electrolyte layer, operation temperature and pressure, redox couple catalyst improvements and reaction pathway tuning, can be further optimized as future research directions to improve the carbon-capture energy efficiencies and costs for practical deployments.\n\nSynthesis of SACs\nThe method used for synthesizing Co-SAC is based on our previously reported method, with some modifications\n\n.

Then, the mixed solution was sonicated for 0.5 h and stirred for another 0.5 h. Subsequently, 12 ml of 1.0 M HCl solution, which contains 3.0 g of ammonium peroxydisulfate, that is, (NH\n\n)\n\nS\n\nO\n\n, was added dropwise into the above mixed solution with vigorous stirring. After polymerization in an ice bath for nearly one day, the mixture was dried using a rotary evaporator. Then, the dried powder was annealed under Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. Finally, the product was treated by alkaline (2.0 M NaOH) and acid (2.0 M H\n\nSO\n\n) leaching successively to remove SiO\n\nnanoparticles templates and unstable Co-based species, respectively, to obtain the Co-SAC. We used the same method to prepare Ni-SAC. The only difference is that 0.405 g NiCl\n\n·6H\n\nO and 1.0 g SiO\n\nwere used to synthesize Ni-SAC.

The mixture was well stirred and refluxed at 80 °C for 24 h. The resulting slurry was washed with water and ethanol after natural cooling until the solution pH reached neutral, and the precipitate obtained was dried overnight at 80 °C in an oven.\n\nPreparation of electrode\nFor preparation of cathode electrode, typically, 40 mg of as-prepared catalysts, 4 ml of 2-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 160 µl of Nafion binder solution (Sigma, 5%) were mixed together to form a catalyst ink with around 10.0 mg ml\n−1\n. The ink was sonicated for about 30 min to obtain a homogeneous ink and then spray coated onto the 5 × 5 cm\n\nSigracet 28 BC gas-diffusion layer (GDL; Fuel Cell Store) electrodes. The Pt/C (Fuel Cell Store) used in this work followed the same procedure to prepare the cathode electrode.

Indeed, such a deviation has been broadly witnessed in Rh-catalysed hydroformylation of propene\n\n,\n\n. Inherent computational limitations and approximations usually contributed to the observations\n\n,\n\n. Nonetheless, both the applied theoretical model and the computational method in our calculations were maintained the same throughout the exploration of both reaction pathways. Hence, the above-mentioned deviation between experimental and theoretical results would not affect the overall conclusion. We thus reasoned that the evaluation of the kinetic differences between two reaction pathways by directly comparing their energy barriers under the same benchmark was reliable. Our DFT calculations were carried out only at 4 MPa, which was same as the pressure chosen for the experimental studies, and we reasoned that such an option was appropriate. Moreover, because the change of pressure did not have a large impact on the selectivity (Supplementary \n), we assumed that it might not be necessary to conduct exhaustive DFT calculations at all other different pressures at the expense of valuable computing resources.\nThe theoretical model of [Rh(CO)\n\n]@MEL was constructed by locating the Rh atom within a silanol nest inside the channels of MEL zeolite. In detail, the MEL model was first obtained by structural optimization of a crystalline unit cell of MEL zeolite derived from the Crystallography Open Database. Subsequently, a silanol nest was created by removing one skeletal Si atom from either inside or outside the MEL channel. A single Rh atom was then located in the silanol group and coordinated with two O atoms to generate an isolated Rh mode. The cluster model [Rh\n\nH(CO)\n\n]@MEL was constructed using a similar approach, but in which three Rh atoms were separately coordinated with O in the silanol nests.\nThe kinetic dimensions of molecules were predicted by Multiwfn wavefunction analysis using the Multiwfn 3.7 program\n\n. The molecular model was first optimized by the Gaussian 16 program package at the level of B3LYP/6-311 G(d, p) (refs.\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). The derived wavefunction of molecules was imported into the Multiwfn program to obtain the kinetic dimensions based on electron-density surface analysis\n\n.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41586-024-07342-y\nSource: main text file\n\nMethods\nfor details) and designated the post-treatment material as\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL\n. ADF-STEM characterization (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n) revealed that the encapsulated Rh species in the\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL\nexisted as either subnanometre clusters ,d,e\n) or isolated Rh atoms ,f,g\n). Notably, highly dispersed subnanometre Rh clusters with an average size of 0.6 nm were prevalent in the sample. Also, the ADF-STEM imaging along the <100> direction enabled the visualization of isolated Rh atoms that were confined within the ten-membered-ring channels of the MEL zeolite.\n\n, Synthetic scheme of\nRh\nOD\n@MEL\n.\nb\n–\ng\n, Aberration-corrected ADF-STEM images of\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL\n.

For the\n0.17Rh@MEL\n, the chemisorption of CO on Rh led to the appearance of three distinct infrared bands \n). The band centred at 2,050 cm\n−1\nwas ascribed to linearly bound CO on the Rh clusters\n\n,\n\n, whereas the other two bands at 2,082 and 2,006 cm\n−1\nrepresented the symmetric and asymmetric modes, respectively, of CO chemisorbed on isolated Rh sites\n\n,\n\n. By contrast, after the oxidative disruption treatment, the infrared signal associated with linear CO adsorption diminished, leaving behind the sole\ngem\n-dicarbonyl adsorption mode. A plausible explanation was that each Rh site, regardless of being isolated or part of a Rh cluster, preferred the configuration of\ngem\n-dicarbonyl binding on exposure to the CO environment.\nTo gain insight into the short-range atomic structure of Rh, we conducted X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study on both\n0.17Rh@MEL\nand\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL\n. The analysis of the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) \n) revealed that the Rh species in\n0.17Rh@MEL\npredominantly existed in the form of metallic clusters, as indicated by the similar energy of its absorption edge and white-line intensity with respect to those from reference Rh foil. By fitting the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), we determined that each Rh atom was averagely coordinated to about 5.6 neighbouring Rh atoms within the first coordination shell (Supplementary \n). By contrast, the average oxidation state of each Rh in\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL\nwas increased, as evidenced by the blueshift of its XANES absorption edge\n\n,\n\n(see Supplementary \nand Supplementary \nfor details), and each Rh atom was only coordinated by approximately 4.0 neighbouring Rh atoms within the first coordination shell. Our further combined EXAFS, STEM, FT-IR and mathematical analyses led to the conclusion that roughly 13% of the Rh species in the sample existed as isolated Rh sites and the remaining 87% was in the form of Rh clusters, both comprising surficial Rh(I)-\ngem\n-dicarbonyl moieties (see details in the ‘Explaining Rh speciation of the samples’ section of\n\nMethods\n). Although some approximations were made and thus uncertainties were introduced, it was still helpful to understand the complexity of Rh speciation, and a set of representative structurally reasonable models were accordingly proposed (Supplementary \n).\nIt is known that even a small fraction of Rh species exposed on the external surface of zeolites may make a substantial contribution to the overall catalytic performance\n\n,\n\n. Despite the high efficiency in encapsulation of Rh into the MEL pores, the deposition of a small amount of Rh species on the external surface was still inevitable, which may have a negative impact on the regioselective hydroformylation of propene. On the basis of this rationale, we sought to use large organosulfur molecules to selectively poison the external Rh sites and only allow the hydroformylation reaction to take place within the zeolite channels. Specifically, 2,4-dimethylbenzenethiol (DMBT) was used as the ideal organosulfur molecule because its kinetic diameter (8.1 Å) exceeded the aperture width of MEL \n) and thus its diffusion into the zeolite channels was probably restricted. Indeed, on exposure to 500 Pa of DMBT/CO mixture at 90 °C, the intensity of CO absorbance in\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL\ngradually diminished over time (Supplementary \n), indicating the success of organosulfur poisoning at the external Rh sites.\n\n, Schematic diagram of kinetic dimensions and deactivation of external Rh by DMBT ligation.\nb\n, Optimization of DMBT concentration for\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL\n-catalysed propene hydroformylation.

In the absence of DMBT poisoning, the pristine\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL\nexhibited the highest activity with a TOF of about 8,100 h\n−1\nbut a moderate regioselectivity favouring the formation of\nn\n-butanal (\nn\n/\ni\n= 4.9). Notably, on the addition of an increasing amount of DMBT, the observed regioselectivity of\nn\n-butanal substantially increased from an\nn\n/\ni\nratio of 20 to 80 within a narrow range of DMBT/Rh ratio from 4.5 to 5.0. Such a trend continued until the DMBT/Rh ratio was 8.0. The resulting catalyst, namely,\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL-DMBT\n, achieved unprecedented high regioselectivity (\nn\n/\ni\n> 110) and chemoselectivity to butanal (>99%) from the hydroformylation of propene (Supplementary \n). Further addition of DMBT beyond 8.0 equivalents did not lead to noticeable changes in either chemoselectivity or regioselectivity. More importantly, the activity of all DMBT-poisoned catalysts remained very high, with TOF values above 6,500 h\n−1\n. It was worth noting that the above-described TOF calculation reflected an average activity for different Rh sites and thus underestimated the activity of the most active species. Of our effort in the optimization of the catalytic performance (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), although the\nn\n/\ni\nratio seemed to clearly decline in the exploited pressure range 0.5–4.0 MPa, when converted into the regioselectivity of\nn\n-butanal, it was indeed entirely above 99%, reflecting its small variance as a function of the applied pressure. Such a trend was not beyond our expectation and was also consistent with the literature\n\n,\n\n. Both the\nn\n/\ni\nratio and overall aldehydes selectivity showed slight decreases along with the reaction process but still remained very high when propene was completely converted \n). Collectively, it was evident that our\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL-DMBT\nshowed excellent regioselectivity and activity, surpassing all previously reported heterogeneous and most homogeneous catalysts in the hydroformylation of propene \nand Supplementary Tables\n\n–\n\n). Besides, the superior catalytic stability of\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL-DMBT\nwas also witnessed in the recycling and continuous flow experiment \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n).\nAs well as\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL\n, two more samples with a Rh mass loading of 0.05 wt% and 0.33 wt% were also prepared for catalytic studies (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary \n). The Rh species in both samples remained in the form of either isolated [Rh(CO)\n\n] or ultrafine Rh clusters with exposed [Rh(CO)\n\n] on the cluster surface, as evidenced by ADF-STEM and FT-IR characterization (Supplementary \n). These samples were subjected to DMBT poisoning and termed\n0.05Rh\nOD\n@MEL-DMBT\nand\n0.33Rh\nOD\n@MEL-DMBT\n, respectively. All three catalysts exhibited a comparable regioselectivity in the hydroformylation of propene (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n), further supporting our predictions on the creation of a unique microenvironment for the encaged Rh species on the organosulfur poisoning of the external Rh sites.\nIn situ FT-IR spectroscopy was used to gain more mechanistic insights of the propene hydroformylation on\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL-DMBT\n\nand Supplementary \n). Before exposure to the reaction medium, two observed CO bands centred at 2,082 and 2,006 cm\n−1\ncould be assigned to the symmetrical and asymmetrical modes for CO chemisorption in [Rh(CO)\n\n] (Rh\nI\n:\nd\n\n, 16 e\n−\nconfiguration)\n\n,\n\n. On initiation of the catalytic reaction, these bands smoothly shifted over 13 min, revealing two new CO adsorption bands at 2,073 and 1,998 cm\n−1\n, tentatively attributed to the symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching modes of [HRh(CO)\n\n] (Rh\nI\n:\nd\n\n, 18 e\n−\nconfiguration)\n\n,\n\n. It is well documented that heteroatoms (for example, oxygen) bonding to metal centres (Lewis acids) in various metal–support interfaces can serve as conjugate bases capable of accepting protons. In the presence of such a Lewis-acid-bonded pair (‘M–O’ bond), heterolytic dissociation of H\n\ncan occur, forming the ‘O–H’ proton adduct and ‘M–H’ metal hydride simultaneously\n\n,\n\n. We speculated that a similar scenario may exist in our case, in which the heterolytic dissociation of H\n\nacross the ‘Rh–O’ bond at the interfacial zeolite occurred and the resulting H\n−\nmigrates to the adjacent [Rh(CO)\n\n] site to form [HRh(CO)\n\n] (refs.\n\n,\n\n). Another prominent CO band arising at 2,038 cm\n−1\nunder the reaction conditions was consistent with the expected CO infrared pattern of [HRh(CO)]\n\n, which is usually believed to be generated through the dissociation of a CO molecule from the parent [HRh(CO)\n\n]. In homogeneous Rh-catalysed hydroformylation, [HRh(CO)]L\nx\n(Rh\nI\n:\nd\n\n, 16 e\n−\n) has been widely recognized as the catalytically active Rh species\n\n. Likewise, the formation of an active site containing HRh(CO)] (Rh\nI\n:\nd\n\n, 16 e\n−\n) is considered a prerequisite for the initiation of the subsequent heterogeneous cycle\n\n. Therefore, we attributed the steadily increasing intensity of the CO band at 2,038 cm\n−1\nto the accumulation of [HRh(CO)] within the measured time window. Further evidence for the existence of the Rh carbonyl species was also obtained from in situ XAS studies (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary \n), in which the typical signal for positively charged Rh species and relevant coordination structure remained unchanged on exposure to the reaction medium.\n\n@MEL\non exposure to the hydroformylation atmosphere (H\n\n/CO/propene/Ar = 47:47:2:4, v/v/v/v, 4 MPa) at 90 °C. The gaseous CO signal was subtracted from the original spectra (Supplementary \n).\nSource Data\nFull size image\nTo the best of our knowledge, it remains very challenging to experimentally acquire reliable thermodynamic and kinetic data under operating conditions in the zeolite systems as direct evidence to support the imagined shape selectivity and we therefore resorted to the theoretical route to seek the possible rationale. In particular, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to acquire the energy landscape on a theoretical [RhH(CO)\n\n]@MEL model (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n), which represented the isolated Rh active sites within the MEL pores. Overall, the energy profile revealed that the aldehyde production was predominantly governed by the CO insertion step (from [Rh(CO)\n\n(C\n\nH\n\n)] (\n\n) to [Rh(CO)(C\n\nH\n\nCO)] (\n\n)), which exhibited the highest energy barrier among all the reaction coordinates \n). The insertion of CO at C\n\nin C\n\nH\n\n= C\n\nHC\n\nH\n\nfavoured the formation of\nn\n-butanal, whereas the insertion on C\n\nled to the undesired\niso\n-butanal. Therefore, a comparative analysis of the energetics associated with these two competitive CO insertion steps provided insights into the regioselectivity of butanal formation. In both pathways, the CO insertion step proceeded through a three-centre transition state (\nTS(5/6)\n), accompanied by elongation of the Rh–propyl bond and migration of the propyl group towards the carbonyl. The elongated Rh–propyl bond pushed the propyl group away from the Rh site, forcing the C\n\n-methyl group to approach the O atoms in the zeolitic lattice. This introduced notable strain into this intermediate species, as evidenced by the considerably increased energy barrier. Notably, the energy barrier for the CO insertion step at C\n\nwas 0.43 eV lower than that at C\n\n, indicating the great potential for the production of\nn\n-butanal over\niso\n-butanal. Also, an apparent orientation of the propyl group along the zeolite channel (\nb\naxis) was observed in\nTS(5/6)\nn\n, whereas\nTS(5/6)\niso\nexhibited a notable distortion of the methyl tail perpendicular to the\nb\n-axis direction, resulting in closer contact with the zeolitic framework \n). This was further supported by the greatly reduced distance between the O atoms in the zeolite framework and the H atoms in the C\n\n-methyl group of\nTS(5/6)\niso\ncompared with\nTS(5/6)\nn\n. Consequently, it was reasonable to conclude that the\niso\n-butanal formation pathway experiences stronger steric hindrance imposed by the zeolite channels compared with the other route leading to\nn\n-butanal, consistent with the pronounced difference in the energy barriers between these two pathways. It was noted that there was a large difference in the calculated and measured activation energies. Nevertheless, this was not unexpected and did not affect the overall conclusion on the regioselectivity (see more discussion in the ‘Theoretical calculations’ section of\n\nMethods\n). Our parallel calculations performed on the cluster model [Rh\n\nH(CO)\n\n]@MEL revealed comparable framework-directing effect in the exclusive formation of\nn\n-butanal (see Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nfor details). By contrast, such an effect was not noticeable for the Rh site located on the exterior of the MEL zeolite (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). These DFT calculation results demonstrated that the confinement effect arising from zeolitic channels played a decisive role in imposing constraints on the reaction intermediates during the hydroformylation of propene, leading to the achieved excellent regioselectivity.\n\n, Gibbs free energy profiles of propene hydroformylation for the production of\nn\n-butanal (red) and\niso\n-butanal (blue) on the [RhH(CO)\n\n]@MEL model.

This metal precursor was added dropwise into the gel solution with vigorous stirring. The gel solution was then hydrolysed at 30 °C for 10 h with stirring (500 r.p.m.).

The resultant yellow solution was transferred into a 50-ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 130 °C for 24 h under static conditions. Following the hydrothermal crystallization, the solid product was isolated by centrifugation and sequentially washed with deionized water and ethanol. Subsequently, it was dried at 80 °C for 12 h in ambient air. The obtained solid sample was further calcined in static air at 560 °C for 5 h and then reduced under a flow of H\n\n/Ar mixture at 600 °C for 2 h.

The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subsequently subjected to passivation using 0.5% O\n\n/Ar as the passivation gas overnight to obtain the α-MoC powder.\n\nSynthesis of Pt/γ-Mo\nN, Pt/M-Mo\n\nN and Pt/α-MoC\nA total of 400 mg of passivated γ-Mo\n\nN (or M-Mo\n\nN, α-MoC, where M = La, Pr, Y, Ho, Cs, Ca, Sr) powder was introduced into 15 ml of H\n\nexperimental procedure as CH\n\nOH temperature-programmed desorption, except for the adsorption stage. The water-to-methanol molar ratio in the liquid phase was maintained at 5:1 to ensure that the partial pressure of water was slightly higher than that of methanol in the gas phase at 30 °C.\n\nexperimental procedures were started. First, 10 ml min\n−1\nAr was switched into the reactor to protect the catalyst, then 10 ml min\n−1\nreactant gas mixture (H\n\nO:Ne:Ar = 1:4:75) was prepared in flow-controlled manifolds and detected by the mass spectrometer until the signals were stabilized. The water was introduced into the system by 2 ml min\n−1\nAr passing through the water bath at 303 K. Second, after the signals of reactant gas stabilized, the downstream four-way valve was switched, and the outflow from the reactor tube was detected by the mass spectrometer.

Under optimal methanol-reforming reaction conditions, the 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN catalyst demonstrated an ATOF of\n\\(\\mathrm{9,837}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\)\nand a CO\n\nselectivity above 99% in carbon products (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand\n\n–\n\n), which outperforms the state-of-the-art Pt/α-MoC catalysts under the same metal loading and reaction conditions (Supplementary \n). This excellent catalytic activity is attributed to the highly active interface between Pt and γ-Mo\n\nN (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). Although better than the Pt/α-MoC catalysts, this catalyst deactivates relatively fast, and the activity is nearly halved after a 200-h evaluation.\nWe then assessed our catalyst design strategy by constructing nano-overlay structures on the γ-Mo\n\nN support. To provide simultaneous protection to both the γ-Mo\n\nN support and the interfacial sites, we aimed to have the catalytically inert species highly dispersed, shielding part of the fragile γ-Mo\n\nN surface and segmenting into discrete partitions to trap Pt. It has been applied to various elements with similar properties of oxygen affinity, chemical stability and inertness for methanol-reforming reaction, including rare-earth elements (Y, La, Pr and Ho) and non-rare-earth elements (Ca, Sr and Cs). Among them, we chose La as the representative example for detailed discussion because it is a commonly used low-cost additive in many catalyst systems\n\n,\n\n. Moreover, La has relatively strong oxygen affinity and does not form solid solutions with Mo oxide or nitride\n\n, so we adopt a simple synthesis method to construct the La-modified γ-Mo\nN support (with La content of 2 wt%, denoted as 2La-Mo\n\nN; see\n\nMethods\nfor details). Structural analysis demonstrates that the 2La-Mo\n\nN sample is composed of porous aggregates of γ-Mo\n\nN nanoparticles with face-centred cubic structure and has a high specific surface area (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n), that is, the addition of 2 wt% La does not change the crystal structure and the morphology of the γ-Mo\n\nN.\nTo visualize the structure and distribution of the La species, we performed atomic-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping with single-atom sensitivity on an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)\n\n,\n\n. Direct discrimination of the La species from the Z-contrast STEM high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images is infeasible due to the small difference in La and Mo atomic numbers. Instead, atomic-scale STEM-EELS mapping using the characteristic La M-edge signals shows that the La signals are mostly confined within sparsely distributed single bright pixels of 0.2 nm (Supplementary \n). Note that the pixel size we chose for STEM-EELS mapping is shorter than the La–La or the La–O–La bonds, indicating that most La species are atomically dispersed over γ-Mo\n\nN. Furthermore, the overlay of the La EELS map and the simultaneously acquired STEM-HAADF image shows that La species appears on the periphery of the projected profiles of the catalyst particles. The STEM results, together with the insolubility of La in molybdenum oxide or nitride\n\nprecursors suggest that the La species primarily forms isolated overlay structures shielding the γ-Mo\n\nN surface (Supplementary \n).\nPt (1 wt%) was then loaded onto the 2La-Mo\n\nN to prepare the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst. Atomic-resolution STEM-HAADF images –c\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n) show similar structure and spatial distribution of Pt species in both 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN and 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN, consisting of primarily isolated Pt atoms and a small amount of sub-nm Pt clusters, in agreement with extended X-ray-absorption fine-structure analysis, which shows low average Pt–Pt coordination numbers (CN\nPt–Pt\n) of 1.6 and 2.5 for 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN and 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN, respectively (Supplementary \n). The overlay structure and isolated dispersion of La species remain unchanged after Pt loading –f,i\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n).\n\nN catalysts.\na\n,\nb\n, STEM-HAADF images of the 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN catalyst with isolated Pt atoms highlighted by blue circles and Pt clusters by yellow circles.\nc–f\n, STEM-HAADF images and atomic-scale EELS analysis of the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst.

The white cycles highlight the protection and partition effect conferred by La nano-overlays. Scale bar, 2 nm (\na\n–\nd\n).\nFull size image\nWe further explore possible interaction between the La nano-overlays and the Pt atomic species using electronic structure analysis. Compared with 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN, the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst shows a weak but obvious presence of oxidized Mo species at 235.7 eV in Mo 3\nd\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) profile (acquired at a low photoelectron kinetic energy of 500 eV for less probing depth), accompanied by an increased intensity of residual oxygen (530.2 eV) (compared with hydroxyl oxygen at 532.6 eV) in O 1\ns\nXPS profile \n). This demonstrates that La bonds with the molybdenum nitride surface through an oxygen bridge (as Mo–O–La species). No visible change in the Pt oxidation state can be observed for catalysts with or without La loading \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n), suggesting that the La species stay remote and do not directly interact with the highly dispersed Pt species. EELS and XPS spectra show that the La species in the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst are in a s+ valance state\n\n(Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), suggesting that the highly dispersed nano-overlays of La species on the γ-Mo\n\nN surface should be robust. Importantly, these stable La nano-overlays have the potential to partially shield the γ-Mo\n\nN surface from deep oxidation during the reaction; segment the surface into isolated nanoscale partitions to accommodate the interfaces of Pt and γ-Mo\n\nN (noted as Pt@γ-Mo\n\nN interfaces) and facilitate the reaction turnover; and hinder the aggregation of Pt atomic species. These provide the structural basis for simultaneous protection of the active support and the active interfaces towards a highly efficient and robust catalyst.\nThe performance of the above-mentioned catalysts was evaluated in the methanol-reforming reaction. The ATOF activity of the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst reaches\n\\(\\mathrm{9,518}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\)\n, which is close to that of 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN (\n\\(\\mathrm{9,837}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\)\n) \n). At lower Pt loading, the ATOF can be as high as\n\\(\\mathrm{41,038}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\)\n(0.02Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN) owing to better dispersion of Pt, surpassing all the catalysts reported (Supplementary \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). The formation of La nano-overlay structure significantly improves the durability of the catalyst with the activity and selectivity remaining at a stable high level during the methanol-reforming reaction \n). Importantly, in sharp contrast to the relatively fast deactivation of the 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN catalyst, the activity of which dropped by about 50% in a 200-h test, the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst maintained a high activity above\n\\(\\mathrm{7,000}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\)\nduring the 1,300-h evaluation. As a result, the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst achieved an ultrahigh TON of\n\\(\\mathrm{10,280,000}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\)\n. It is worth emphasizing that the activity of the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst decreased by only 25% (compared with the peak activity) at the end of the 1,300-h reaction and was stable in the last 100 h. This implies that the TON value obtained was limited by the reaction period we investigated, and the true lifespan of the catalyst is probably much longer. Furthermore, the catalyst showed excellent efficiency for the reforming and the selectivity towards CO\n\nstayed above 99% (Supplementary \n). With a lower space velocity, the methanol conversion can be kept around 90% during the 1300-h reaction (Supplementary \n), promising practical applications.\n\n, Catalytic activity of the 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN and 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalysts and selectivity of the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst in the methanol-reforming reaction.

All these additive elements can markedly improve the methanol-reforming durability of the Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN catalyst to a similar level, whereas the intrinsic activity of the Pt@γ-Mo\n\nN interfaces remains unaltered \nand Supplementary \n). Atomic-scale STEM-EELS analysis of 1Pt/2Pr-Mo\n\nN, 1Pt/2Ca-Mo\n\nN, 1Pt/2Sr-Mo\n\nN and 1Pt/2Cs-Mo\n\nN (Supplementary \n) also shows that these catalytically inert elements are atomically dispersed on γ-Mo\n\nN, similar to that of La. These results with different elements demonstrate the universality of the catalyst design strategy proposed in this paper.\nThe catalytic performance of the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst was comprehensively rivalled with other well-established best noble-metal catalyst systems, including Ru complex\n\n, Pd/ZnO (\n), Pt/Al\n\nO\n\n(\n) and 1Pt/α-MoC over five key dimensionalities in terms of durability, TON, ATOF, mass-specific activity and CO\n\nselectivity \nand Supplementary \n). A full comparison with many other catalysts is provided in Supplementary \n. The 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst demonstrated absolute superiority over all other reference catalysts in all five dimensionalities, particularly regarding durability. Moreover, the ATOF and mass-specific activity of 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN were measured to be three and two times, respectively, higher than those of 1Pt/α-MoC (Supplementary \n), which exhibited the highest hydrogen production activity among supported noble-metal catalysts reported so far in the literature, to our knowledge.\nWe designed a series of experiments to check whether the La nano-overlays have reduced the susceptibility of the exposed surface of γ-Mo\n\nN to water vapour oxidation during the methanol-reforming reaction and protect the interfacial sites from changes in the metal–support interaction. We first compared the structure of the 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN and 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalysts after a 200-h reaction under the same conditions, for which the two catalysts already showed different deactivation behaviours. From XPS (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), X-ray diffraction (Supplementary \n) and STEM (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n) analyses, the bulk structures of the γ-Mo\n\nN and 2La-Mo\n\nN supports were kept intact. Moreover, atomic-scale STEM-EELS mapping shows that the atomic La overlay structure was well-preserved after the 200-h reaction (Supplementary \n). XPS and XANES indicate that the electronic states of Pt for both spent catalysts remained similar to the fresh ones (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). A slight aggregation of Pt species was observed in the 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN after 200 h of evaluation (Supplementary \n), whereas the average CN\nPt–Pt\nof 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN remained stable (Supplementary \n). Nevertheless, the slight increase of CN\nPt–Pt\n, close to the margin of error of the X-ray absorption spectroscopy fitting, should not be the decisive cause of the sharp activity drop in the 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN catalyst. Furthermore, the CN\nPt–Pt\nof 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN after the reaction is similar to that of the fresh 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst, but their methanol-reforming activity is noticeably different. These results, thus, indicate that the stability difference may arise from surface structural discrepancies.\nWe then conducted surface-sensitive in situ Raman spectroscopy experiments, as Raman spectroscopy is highly sensitive to the formation of molybdenum oxide species\n\n(Supplementary \n). As shown in Supplementary \n, when methanol/water steam was fed onto the fresh 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN catalyst at 200 °C, the Raman bands of molybdenum oxide at 354 cm\n−1\n, 492 cm\n−1\n, 572 cm\n−1\nand 729 cm\n−1\ncan be resolved, which can be attributed to molybdenum oxide species formed on the surface, demonstrating that the surface of 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN can be easily oxidized, most possibly by water, under reaction atmosphere. By contrast, for the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst (Supplementary \n), no detectable Mo–O signal was observed under the same condition, indicating its superior oxidation resistance compared with 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN.\nTo further demonstrate that the catalyst deactivation is mainly caused by surface oxidation by water, we conducted an accelerated-deactivation experiment by feeding water vapour into the reactor for 12 h after a 36-h methanol-reforming reaction to induce further surface oxidation of the catalyst, and restarted the methanol-reforming reaction to evaluate the impact of water oxidation on catalyst activity \n). The water treatment caused obvious drops in activity in the three catalysts. Specifically, the activity of 1Pt/α-MoC dropped by 68%, and the activity declined by 34% for 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN. By contrast, the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst showed only an 18% decrease in activity. Quasi-in-situ Raman \n) and XPS \n) analyses of catalyst samples extracted from three different states, that is, fresh; after 36-h methanol-reforming reaction; and after 36-h methanol-reforming reaction and the 12-h water treatment, show that the observed deactivation is directly correlated with the extent of surface oxidation. After the 36-h methanol-reforming reaction (state ii), obvious surface oxidation was observed on the 1Pt/α-MoC catalyst, as evidenced by the emergence of clear Raman bands associated with Mo–O structures and the strong oxygen signals around 532.6 eV in the O 1\ns\nXPS spectra, whereas 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN and 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN showed no evident sights of oxidation. Following the subsequent 12-h water treatment (state iii), surface oxidation can be seen for 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN, whereas the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst remained almost unchanged. These results collectively demonstrate that surface oxidation by water is the main cause for the deactivation of these catalysts, and the La nano-overlay structure can improve the oxidation resistance of the γ-Mo\n\nN support, which itself is already more antioxidative than α-MoC. More importantly, the methanol-reforming reaction turnover is not affected by the La structures on the γ-Mo\n\nN surface. It demonstrates that the La nano-overlays shield part of the easy-to-be-oxidized γ-Mo\n\nN surface sites but keep remote to the reactive Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN interfacial sites. This is the key to the success of the La nano-overlay strategy.\n\n, Comparison of hydrogenation production rates of 1Pt/α-MoC, 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN and 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalysts in the methanol-reforming reaction before and after the accelerated-deactivation experiment (water treatment experiment). The experiments include three steps: 36-h methanol-reforming reaction; 12-h water treatment; and 12-h methanol-reforming reaction.

The catalyst was initially purged with 10 ml min\n−1\nAr, and then the feed gas was switched to 10 ml min\n−1\nH\n\nO:Ne:Ar (1:4:75) twice, with Ne used as an internal standard \n; see\n\nMethods\nfor details). The similar specific surface areas of three catalyst supports (Supplementary \n) allow us to use the amount of H\n\nO consumption to indicate the number of surface sites available for water adsorption and the amount of H\n\nproduction to describe the reactivity of the surface sites for water dissociation, respectively. The results are summarized in \n. Compared with α-MoC, γ-Mo\n\nN showed significantly lower H\n\nO consumption and H\n\nproduction ,f\n), and twice the ratio of H\n\nproduction to water consumption dropped drastically from 78.2% (for α-MoC) to 11.0% (for γ-Mo\n\nN) at 100 °C (Supplementary \n). Although both the γ-Mo\n\nN and α-MoC are highly reactive for water activation, the results indicate that the ability for water adsorption/dissociation is weaker on γ-Mo\n\nN surface than α-MoC surface, which accounts for the antioxidation characteristics of the former. Importantly, although the H\n\nO consumption on 2La-Mo\n\nN was lower than that of γ-Mo\n\nN, the ratio of H\n\nproduction to water consumption remained the same on both supports (Supplementary \n). These results further indicate that the La overlay shields and blocks only part of γ-Mo\n\nN surface sites without affecting the intrinsic water-splitting ability of the remaining surface. Furthermore, we verified the protection mechanism of other elements, including Pr, Cs and Sr, with H\n\nO TKA experiments at 100 °C \nand Supplementary \n). Similar to the case of La, the introduction of these additives decreased only the H\n\nO consumption of γ-Mo\n\nN (Supplementary \n) without influencing its H\n\nproduction ability \n).\n\n, Catalytic activity of the 1Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN and 1Pt/2M-Mo\n\nN (M = La, Pr, Cs and Sr) catalyst for the methanol-reforming reaction.

The detailed H\n\nO TKA data can be found in Supplementary \n.\nFull size image\nThe mechanism of preventing water adsorption was further verified by density functional theory calculations in Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand thoroughly discussed in the Theoretical Discussion of the\nSupplementary Information\n. Because the La species does not directly interact with the Pt species, the La overlays do not alter the inherent catalytic properties of the remaining γ-Mo\n\nN surface sites and the Pt@γ-Mo\n\nN interfaces. Besides protecting the Pt/γ-Mo\n\nN from surface oxidation, the highly dispersed La nano-overlays could also function as physical barriers shielding the γ-Mo\n\nN to impede migration of surface Pt species, contributing to the impeded Pt aggregation and enhanced stability of catalyst (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Theoretical Discussion of the\nSupplementary Information\n).\nOn the basis of the mechanism discussed above, we anticipate that a catalyst with a much lower Pt loading and better Pt dispersion could potentially achieve a higher ATOF and similar stability, if a higher amount of La overlay is applied to cover the larger amount of redundant γ-Mo\n\nN surface sites. Following the same strategy, we developed a 0.2Pt/5La-Mo\n\nN catalyst with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading but a higher (5 wt%) La loading. The increased La nano-overlay coverage and atomically dispersed Pt species in this catalyst were verified by STEM-HAADF imaging and EELS mapping (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). This atomically dispersed catalyst exhibits a higher initial ATOF of\n\\(\\mathrm{24,500}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\)\nowing to better Pt dispersion. More importantly, this new catalyst with much lower Pt usage achieved a similar mass-specific activity to the 1Pt/2La-Mo\n\nN catalyst and demonstrated a record-high TON, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 during a shorter period methanol-reforming evaluation of 800 h under the same conditions \nand Supplementary \n). After the 800-hour reaction, the hydrogen production activity of 0.2Pt/5La-Mo\n\nN decreased by only one-third of its peak performance. To our knowledge, both the TON and the mass-specific total H\n\nproduction of our Pt/La-Mo\n\nN catalysts (Extended Data \n, Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n) surpass by far the highest value reported for other heterogeneous catalysts and homogeneous catalysts in the methanol-reforming process, showing great potential for practical applications.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that dispersing inert nano-overlays shielding the γ-Mo\n\nN surface provides comprehensive protection to both the reactive γ-Mo\n\nN support and the active interfacial sites by partially occupying and segmenting the surface. This new strategy has led to an ultra-stable atomically dispersed Pt/La-Mo\n\nN catalyst for hydrogen production through a methanol-reforming reaction, achieving a record-high TON, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 during an 800-h evaluation while maintaining the high intrinsic activity from the atomic-scale Pt@γ-Mo\n\nN interfaces, showing promising potential for practical hydrogen production. This strategy provides a new approach for stabilizing interfacial catalysts on reactive supports without compromising their inherent high activity, which could pave the way for reducing the noble metal dosage and improving the durability of heterogeneous catalysts in a wide range of catalytic applications.\n\nSynthesis of γ-Mo\n\nN\nγ-Mo\n\nN was synthesized using a temperature-programmed nitridation technique.

                "output": "synthesis and characterizations\nA simple one-pot synthetic procedure followed by an annealing process in an argon/hydrogen mixture (Ar/H\n\n: 97/3) was used to produce the Ni-rich PtNi alloy nanowires (composition ~Pt\n\npreparation of SANi-PtNWs with the interrupted dealloying process is highly repeatable and the resulting materials show consistent performance in 10 independent batches (Supplementary \n). Furthermore, a chronopotentiometry stability test shows negligible over-potential change for HER when operating at a constant current density of 5 A mg\n\nexperimental conditions, we explored the occupied adsorption sites as a function of hydrogen coverage. The optimal hydrogen coverage was determined by first-principle atomistic thermodynamics. The HER activity for all locally stable sites was calculated using a volcano-type kinetic model, which expresses the exchange current\n\nexperimental potential of −70 mV versus RHE, a high coverage of 1 ML is reached, with occupation of both active (7/16 ML) and inactive (9/16 ML) sites. The significant density of highly active sites contributes to the high activity of the pure-PtNWs.\nIn addition to the models of the defective surface, the influence of SANi on the surface (model D) was modelled by inserting single Ni atoms in the first layer of a Pt surface. In the considered basic conditions, two OH groups bind with the surface Ni atom \n), in line with experimental data\n\nexperimental conditions (−70 mV versus RHE), the optimal coverage is 5/9 ML \n), which means the B1 bridge site and T1–T4 top sites are occupied by hydrogen (black and red symbols in \n).\nOne should note that the OH ligands are crucial for the enhanced HER activity: a single bare Ni atom does not produce this favourable electronic modification (Supplementary \n). All the additional DFT models and the adsorption free energies for all the models are shown in Supplementary Figs.\n8g–i\n\nexperimental potential (Supplementary \n) and that CO adsorption on SANi-modified Pt top sites is 0.06–0.28 eV weaker than that on the Pt top sites (Supplementary\n\nexperimentally and theoretically, these surface features can also contribute to improved activity for HER, MOR and EOR when compared with the Pt/C reference. Taking a step further, the current study further explores single-atom decoration as a general strategy for tailoring the local electronic structure of Pt catalysts to achieve further enhanced specific SA for a series of technological relevant electrochemical reactions with little or no sacrifice of the surface area, and thus delivering optimized MA, which is critical for practical applications. The significant enhancement of MA for various electrocatalytic systems clearly demonstrates that the surface decoration with single atoms offers an effective and general strategy for tailoring precious metal catalysts for diverse reactions. This strategy of single-atom decoration, by interrupted dealloying, can be expected to be applicable to other dopant elements such as Fe, Co or Cu species.\nWe should also note that the single-atom tailoring of Pt nanocatalysts is also conceptually distinct from typical single-atom catalysts intensively explored recently. In a typical single-atom catalyst, single metallic atoms are often dispersed on a host substrate with the single metal atoms functioning as the primary active sites\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. In contrast, in our case, single metal atoms decorate the surface of precious metal Pt catalysts to modify the local atomic configuration and electronic structures of the surrounding Pt atoms, thus tailoring their catalytic activity for specific reactions. Here, single metal atoms are not the primary active sites but play a critical role as a promoter to enhance the activity of the Pt-based catalysts without significantly blocking the surface active sites, thus defining a general strategy for creating multifunctional electrocatalysts with optimized surface area, SA and MA at the same time.\n\nSynthesis of PtNi alloy nanowires\nAll chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. In a typical synthesis, 20 mg Pt(acac)\n\nand 40 mg Ni(acac)\n\nwere mixed with 130 mg glucose, 1.7 mg W(CO)\n\nand 60 mg PVP-40 in a glass vial, with 5 ml of oleylamine and octadecene (3:2 volume ratio) as co-solvent. The mixture was heated to 140 °C for 6 h to form Pt–NiO core–shell nanowires. The resulting nanowires were collected via centrifuge at 7,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After loading the nanowires on carbon black, the catalysts were then annealed under 450 °C in argon/hydrogen (97:3) atmosphere for 12 h to obtain the PtNi alloy nanowires supported on carbon black.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41929-019-0279-6\nSource: main text file\n\nCatalyst synthesis and characterizations\nA simple one-pot synthetic procedure followed by an annealing process in an argon/hydrogen mixture (Ar/H\n\n: 97/3) was used to produce the Ni-rich PtNi alloy nanowires (composition ~Pt\n\nNi\n\n) with an average length of ~300 nm and diameter of ~4.5 nm (Supplementary \n). The resulting PtNi nanowires were dispersed on a carbon support in ethanol to form the catalyst ink, which was then cast onto a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE, geometrical area = 0.196 cm\n\n) to form a homogeneous film. An electrochemical dealloying process was performed via cyclic voltammetry (CV) between 0.05 V and 1.10 V versus RHE in 0.1 M HClO\n\nto gradually remove nickel species. The ECSA gradually increased with increasing number of CV cycles and eventually saturated at ~112.9 ± 5.4 m\n\ng\nPt\n−1\nafter 200 cycles (Supplementary ,d\n), indicating completion of the dealloying process to obtain pure Pt nanowires (pure-PtNWs)\n\n. Such an ECSA evolution trend was also confirmed by acidic CO stripping experiments (Supplementary ,f\n). The average diameter was reduced from ~4.5 nm before to ~2.0 nm after the complete dealloying process (Supplementary \n).\nTo tailor nickel decoration in the resulting PtNWs, we interrupted the acidic CV dealloying process periodically to produce PtNWs with a different amount of nickel decorating species; the PtNWs were then transferred into nitrogen-saturated 1 M KOH for 100 additional CV cycles between 0.05 V and 1.6 V for further activation. The resulting dealloyed nanowires with selectively decorated Ni species were generally stable for the basic conditions under which their catalytic performance was evaluated. We initially used HER as a model reaction to evaluate the activity of the resulting PtNW catalysts with varying amount of nickel species (Supplementary \n) and discovered that peak performance was achieved after 180 acidic dealloying CV cycles. Too much (<180 cycles) or too little (>180 cycles) nickel species reduced the overall HER activity (Supplementary \n). The produced Ni species were stable under basic conditions. We thus focus our discussion on this optimum material produced with 180 dealloying CV cycles unless otherwise specifically mentioned.\nHigh-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was used to probe the atomic structure of the resulting material. The HAADF-STEM results show an ultrafine one-dimensional (1D) crystalline configuration with rich surface defects, concave cavity sites and steps, as highlighted by white arrows in \n. The HAADF-STEM image shows that the spacing is 0.225 nm \n), ~2.2% smaller than that of crystalline Pt (0.230 nm). Compositional analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) revealed an overall Pt:Ni ratio of 92:8 for SANi-PtNWs, corresponding to 2.4 Ni atoms per square nanometre of surface area. Considering the Pt surface atom density of ~15 Pt nm\n−2\n, the surface Ni:Pt atom ratio is ~1:6. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) elemental mapping of Ni \n) and a Ni overlaid on Pt HAADF contrast image \n) reveals that the Ni atoms are sparsely distributed on the PtNWs.\n\n, Ni EELS mapping.\nc\n, Overlaid image of Ni-EELS mapping on Pt, with red representing Pt and green representing Ni.\nd\n,\ne\n, Pt EXAFS fitting result (\nd\n) and Ni EXAFS fitting result (\ne\n).\nFull size image\nWe also conducted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements to probe the local atomistic and electronic structures. The oxidation state of Pt can be probed by the white line intensity at the Pt L\n\n-edge in XANES spectra\n\n. The Pt XANES result shows that the white line intensity of our sample (Supplementary \n) is close to that of a Pt foil, indicating that the average oxidation state of Pt is mostly zero. The Pt extended XAFS (EXAFS) fitting result shows a main peak at ~2.74 Å \nand Supplementary \n), which is ~1.8% smaller than the Pt–Pt bond length in bulk Pt (2.79 Å in Pt foil), consistent with the TEM studies described above and in \n.\nXANES for the Ni K-edge provides information on the oxidation state of Ni species based on the absorption threshold position and white line intensity (due to the allowed 1\ns\n→ 4\np\ntransition)\n\n. The Ni K-edge XANES in our optimum material closely resembles that of Ni(OH)\n\nwith slightly lower intensity (Supplementary \n), suggesting that the nickel species have an average oxidation state close to two, and primarily exists as a surface decorating species (an oxidation state of zero is expected for the buried Ni). Further X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies also confirmed the 2+ oxidation state of the Ni species (Supplementary \n). The Ni EXAFS results show a single peak at 1.6 Å \nand Supplementary \n), which can be attributed to the first shell Ni–O bond. There is no obvious peak at 2.1 Å (for Ni–Ni coordination in metallic Ni) or 2.7 Å (for Ni–O–Ni coordination in Ni(OH)\n\n) \n), strongly confirming that the Ni species exist as single atomic species without long-range coordination to other Ni centres. The XANES and EXAFS hence demonstrate the successful creation of single-atom nickel-modified PtNWs (SANi-PtNWs) catalysts. The EXAFS fitting details are described in Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\n.\nHER measurements of the SANi-PtNWs\nThe HER activity of the SANi-PtNWs was investigated by using the rotation disk electrode (RDE) test and compared against the fully dealloyed pure-PtNWs and commercial Pt/C (10 wt%). The CV studies of the SANi-PtNWs show two exclusive Ni\n2+\n/Ni\n3+\nredox peaks at 1.321 V (Ni\n3+\n→ Ni\n2+\n) and 1.388 V (Ni\n2+\n→ Ni\n3+\n) versus RHE, respectively \n), which are absent in the pure-PtNWs. These redox peaks are widely recognized as the signature of nickel species\n\n,\n\n, which further confirm that the nickel species were successfully decorated on PtNWs. The integration of the hydrogen absorption–desorption region gives a high ECSA of 106.2 ± 4.5 m\n\ng\nPt\n−1\nfor SANi-PtNWs, nearly comparable to that of the pure-PtNWs, and considerably larger than those of the previously reported Pt-Ni(OH)\n\n-based nanocomposites (ECSA ≈ 20–60 m\n\ng\nPt\n−1\n)\n\n,\n\n, highlighting that it is critical to precisely tune the number and structure of the decorating species to prevent undesired blockage of surface reactive sites and ensure high ECSA values.\n\n.\nb\n,\nc\n, ECSA normalized (\nb\n) and Pt mass loading normalized (\nc\n) HER LSV results with 95%\ni\nR compensation at a scan rate of 5 mV s\n−1\n.\nd\n, Pt mass normalized HER Tafel slope.\ne\n, Comparison of ECSA (black arrow, left axis), SA values (normalized by ECSA, green arrow, right axis) and MAs (normalized by Pt mass, purple arrow, right axis) for HER at −70 mV versus RHE for all tested materials.\nf\n, Comparison of HER MA of the SANi-PtNWs at −70 mV versus RHE with state-of-the-art values reported previously.\na\nThe material in \nwas tested in 0.1 M KOH.

The SA values are 0.95, 6.11 ± 0.34 and 10.72 ± 0.41 mA cm\n−2\nat −70 mV versus RHE for the Pt/C, pure-PtNWs and SANi-PtNWs, respectively. It should be noted that the SAs reported here are normalized to the ECSA, in contrast to the electrode geometrical area used in some previous studies\n\n. Meanwhile, the LSV curves normalized by Pt mass give MA values of 0.71, 6.90 ± 0.36 and 11.80 ± 0.43 A mg\nPt\n−1\nfor Pt/C, pure-PtNWs and SANi-PtNWs at −70 mV versus RHE \n). The Tafel diagrams give a Tafel slope of 60.3 mV dec\n−1\nfor the SANi-PtNWs compared to 78.1 mV dec\n−1\nfor the PtNWs and 133.4 mV dec\n−1\nfor the Pt/C \n), clearly demonstrating the considerably improved HER kinetics with the single-Ni-atom decorated catalysts.\nWe further compared the ECSA, SA and MA values of the three different catalysts tested \n). Both the pure-PtNWs and the SANi-PtNWs exhibit a similar ECSA, much higher than that of the Pt/C control. Importantly, the specific SA of the SANi-PtNWs is nearly twice that of the pure-PtNWs, clearly demonstrating that the SANi decoration considerably improves the HER kinetics. Together, with simultaneous achievement of high ECSA and high SA, the SANi-PtNWs deliver a clear leap in MA, achieving a value ~3–10 times higher than those of state-of-the-art HER catalysts \nand \n). Additionally, at −70 mV versus RHE, SANi-PtNWs showed a SA (normalized by ECSA) of 11.8 mA cm\n−2\nin 4 M KOH (Supplementary \n) and 25.7 mA cm\n−2\nand 48 mA cm\n−2\nat elevated temperature (313 K and 333 K, Supplementary \n), ~9–14 times higher than those of Pt/C. These results indicate that the promoted HER activity of SANi-PtNWs is maintained under harsher conditions.\n Comparing the HER performance of SANi-PtNWs and pure-PtNWs versus the state of the art at −70 mV versus RHE\nFull size table\nWe should also note that the preparation of SANi-PtNWs with the interrupted dealloying process is highly repeatable and the resulting materials show consistent performance in 10 independent batches (Supplementary \n). Furthermore, a chronopotentiometry stability test shows negligible over-potential change for HER when operating at a constant current density of 5 A mg\n\nPt\n−1\nin 1 M KOH after 4 h, suggesting such single-atom decoration is stable during the electrochemical processes (Supplementary \n). The improved HER durability could be partly attributed to multipoint line contacts between the 1D nanowires and the carbon support, which prevents physical movement and aggregation (note that the movement and aggregation 0D nanoparticle catalysts contribute significantly to the degrading activities); additionally, the SANi-PtNWs can effectively reduce the reaction kinetic barrier, delivering a higher current density at the reduced over-potential, which could also contribute to the durability of the catalyst during long-time operation.\nDFT calculations of HER activity\nTo further explore the impact of the SANi species on HER activity, we conducted DFT calculations, probing the hydrogen adsorption free energies on a series of model catalytic active sites\n\n. We first considered the fully dealloyed pure-PtNWs, which present a variety of defect sites including atoms with lower and higher metallic coordination than the regular Pt termination. To this end, we constructed representative models of the local surface environments in the form of steps or one-layer concave cavities\n\n. The local surface environment at these sites has been described using three models: models A \nand Supplementary \n) and B (Supplementary \n) consist of differently sized concave cavities on the Pt surface, and model C (Supplementary ,d\n) consists of a Pt stepped surface.\n\n, Exchange current\ni\n\nfor HER as a function of *H adsorption free energy for the locally stable adsorption sites in models A, B and C (the structures of models B and C are shown in Supplementary –d\n).\nc\n, Adsorption free energy of hydrogen on the model A Pt surface as a function of the applied potential\nU\nRHE\nat various coverage in pH 14 solution.\nd\n, Model D for SANi-decorated Pt surface, with the Ni atom being in the surface layer.

To determine which adsorption sites are accessible in the experimental conditions, we explored the occupied adsorption sites as a function of hydrogen coverage. The optimal hydrogen coverage was determined by first-principle atomistic thermodynamics. The HER activity for all locally stable sites was calculated using a volcano-type kinetic model, which expresses the exchange current\ni\n\nas a function of hydrogen adsorption free energy \n)\n\n. The activity optimum appears for a site with hydrogen-binding energy 0.09 eV weaker than that on the hollow sites occupied on Pt\n\n. This model was first proposed for HER in acidic water, but then proven also to be valid for HER in alkaline water\n\n.\nThe defective surface models of the dealloyed PtNWs show a large distribution of hydrogen-binding strengths with a rich population of active sites with binding energy near the optimum value \n). Bridge sites on the ridges of the cavities are clearly more stable than hollow sites on Pt, but accordingly poorly active for HER. The fcc sites on the defective surface models are less stable than those on Pt by 0.03–0.1 eV and in the uppermost volcano region. Top sites are not stable on Pt (they diffuse to fcc hollow sites), but interestingly they become locally stable both inside the cavity and on the upper terrace close to the ridge on the defective models (see T1 and T2 on model A for example). These top sites show a weaker hydrogen-binding energy versus hollow sites on Pt and are placed in the highly active zone.\nWhen considering all sites together, the H atoms will first occupy the inactive bridge sites at low coverage, and then occupy the active top and fcc hollow sites with increasing coverage. It is hence crucial to determine the hydrogen coverage under realistic conditions. The total adsorption free energy at different hydrogen coverage is shown in \nas a function of the electrode potential versus RHE (\nU\nRHE\n). For model A, in pH 14 solution, a low coverage (1/16 ML (monolayers)) is favoured for\nU\nRHE\n> 0.40 V, while below 0.25 V the hydrogen coverage strongly rises to 9/16 ML (occupation of three B1 sites and six B2 sites in \n). For a potential below 0.10 V, sites that are more active than Pt begin to be populated (three F sites, three T2 sites and one T1 site). At the experimental potential of −70 mV versus RHE, a high coverage of 1 ML is reached, with occupation of both active (7/16 ML) and inactive (9/16 ML) sites. The significant density of highly active sites contributes to the high activity of the pure-PtNWs.\nIn addition to the models of the defective surface, the influence of SANi on the surface (model D) was modelled by inserting single Ni atoms in the first layer of a Pt surface. In the considered basic conditions, two OH groups bind with the surface Ni atom \n), in line with experimental data \nand Supplementary \n). \nshows the HER activity predicted from the volcano curve for the stable adsorption sites at low and high hydrogen coverage conditions. DFT calculations demonstrate that such SANi species electronically modify the Pt atoms in their surroundings, decreasing their hydrogen-binding energy to the nearly optimal HER activity region. In the low coverage condition (≤5/9 ML), hydrogen adsorbs preferentially on Pt–Ni bridge site B1 \n) and then on the top Pt sites (T1–T4), while at high coverage (>5/9 ML), occupation of bridge sites B1 and B2 together with slightly less stable hollow sites F1–F5 becomes favoured over top site occupations (Supplementary \n). Notably, all the sites in the SANi-decorated Pt surface, as shown in \n, are more active than those without SANi decoration. Under experimental conditions (−70 mV versus RHE), the optimal coverage is 5/9 ML \n), which means the B1 bridge site and T1–T4 top sites are occupied by hydrogen (black and red symbols in \n).\nOne should note that the OH ligands are crucial for the enhanced HER activity: a single bare Ni atom does not produce this favourable electronic modification (Supplementary \n). All the additional DFT models and the adsorption free energies for all the models are shown in Supplementary Figs.\n8g–i\nand\n\nand Supplementary \n, respectively. It is important to note that the SANi species only significantly enhances the nearest-neighbouring Pt sites. In this regard, surface decoration by the well-distributed SANi is indeed highly desired for generating the most activated Pt sites without unnecessarily blocking too many Pt sites to achieve an optimized MA. Larger clusters of nickel species would have much fewer neighbouring Pt sites and also block more surface Pt sites (Supplementary \n).\nMOR and EOR activities of the SANi-PtNWs\nTo further explore the SANi-PtNWs as multifunctional electrocatalysts, we evaluated their performance for MOR and EOR. The SANi-PtNWs were prepared in the same way as those described in the HER experiments. The MOR test was conducted in aqueous electrolyte with 1 M methanol and 1 M KOH. CV with a scan rate of 20 mV s\n−1\nwas used to evaluate the catalytic properties of the SANi-PtNWs, and the results were compared with those for pure-PtNWs and the Pt/C under the same test conditions. Importantly, the Pt mass-normalized CV curve shows a peak current density of 7.93 ± 0.45 A mg\nPt\n−1\nat 0.816 V versus RHE \n), more than seven and two times those of the commercial Pt/C (1.04 A mg\nPt\n−1\n) and the pure-PtNWs (3.87 A mg\nPt\n−1\n), respectively. Additionally, a 144 mV decrease in the onset over-potential (defined as the over-potential required to reach a MA of 0.1 A mg\nPt\n−1\n) is observed in the SANi-PtNWs when compared with Pt/C, suggesting the lower activation barrier of methanol oxidation on the SNAi-PtNWs surface \n). Similarly, the EOR test in 1 M ethanol/1 M KOH solution shows a peak MA of 5.60 ± 0.27 A mg\nPt\n−1\nat 0.785 V versus RHE for the SANi-PtNWs \n), which is more than seven and three times higher than for the Pt/C and pure-PtNWs, respectively. A 61 mV decrease of the onset over-potential is also observed for the SANi-PtNWs versus the Pt/C reference.\n\n, where the concentration of methanol is 1 M.\nb\n, EOR CVs, with a sweeping rate of 20 mV s\n−1\n, where the concentration of ethanol is 1 M.\nc\n, Chronoamperometry MOR test at a potential of 0.65 V versus RHE.\nd\n,\ne\n, MOR (\nd\n) and EOR (\ne\n) peak MA comparison with recent state-of-the-art values.

Apparently, the MOR activity of the Pt/C benchmark material shows a rather rapid decay to 0.056 A mg\nPt\n−1\nafter a 3,600 s chronoamperometry test at 0.650 V versus RHE. In contrast, the SANi-PtNWs show a relatively stable MA of 0.76 A mg\nPt\n−1\nafter a 3,600 s chronoamperometry test under the same conditions, clearly demonstrating the superior stability of SANi-PtNWs catalysts when compared to the Pt/C. The pure-PtNWs also show a faster activity decay to 0.26 A mg\nPt\n−1\nafter a 3,600 s chronoamperometry test (versus 0.76 A mg\nPt\n−1\nfor the SANi-PtNWs). These studies demonstrate that the SANi decoration not only boosts the activity, but also improves durability.\nWe also conducted DFT calculations to probe the origin of activity/stability enhancement by SANi decoration. A major path for catalyst deactivation in MOR is poisoning by CO intermediates. For model D, consisting of a Ni(OH)\n\n-decorated Pt surface \n), the DFT calculations clearly indicate that all steps in the reaction pathway are exothermic at the experimental potential (Supplementary \n) and that CO adsorption on SANi-modified Pt top sites is 0.06–0.28 eV weaker than that on the Pt top sites (Supplementary \nand \n), hence facilitating the final step conversion from CO to CO\n\n. Furthermore, we conducted CO stripping experiments to probe the CO binding strength of different catalysts (Supplementary \n). The CO stripping experiments show that the SANi-PtNWs exhibit a 52 mV and 88 mV decrease of the onset potential, and 8 mV and 38 mV decrease of CO oxidation peak potential compared to the cases of pure-PtNWs and Pt/C, respectively. These results are largely consistent with the DFT calculations and suggest that the enhanced activity and durability for MOR/EOR could be attributed at least partly to the change in CO binding strength upon SANi modification, hence effectively mitigating the catalyst poisoning issue. This understanding further demonstrates the exciting potential of the single-atom tailoring in modifying the kinetics of MOR or EOR.\nCompared with the state-of-the-art Pt or PtRu-based MOR catalysts tested under the same conductions, the SANi-PtNWs catalysts show the highest SA and MA reported so far, to the best of our knowledge, with the MA achieved in the SANi-PtNWs catalysts (~3–6 times the state-of-the-art values reported recently; \n). When comparing all EOR catalysts reported so far, the SANi-PtNWs also show a considerable advantage in MA \n) (~2–6 times the best values reported recently). Together, these studies clearly demonstrate that the use of SANi-tailored pure-PtNWs presents a major leap for both MOR and EOR, offering significant potential for future alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cell development.\nDiscussion\nWe have designed an effective approach to tailor Pt nanocatalysts with single atomic nickel (SANi) species. By combining XANES and EXAFS analyses with atomic-scale STEM and EELS mapping studies, we verified that the PtNW surface was successfully modified with surface SANi. Electrocatalytic tests revealed that the resulting SANi-modified Pt nanocatalysts exhibit considerably improved HER performance when compared with state-of-the-art HER catalysts. DFT calculations demonstrate that the single Ni atoms, liganded by two hydroxyl groups, electronically promote the neighbouring Pt atoms and enhance their activity towards HER. Our studies suggest that an optimum decoration density (surface Ni:Pt ratio ~1:6) is critical for maximizing SA while retaining a high ECSA. This decoration density can be readily tuned, in a fully repeatable way, by our gradual dealloying process, but is difficult to achieve with other direct synthetic approaches. Additional MOR and EOR electrocatalytic studies further demonstrate greatly improved MA values for these reactions. It is important to note that the MAs achieved in SANi-PtNWs do not merely surpass previous works, but also represent a conceptual advance over the state of the art, with the Pt MAs for HER, MOR and EOR about 1.5–20, 3–6 and 2–6 times higher than state-of-the-art values reported recently.\nOur previous studies have shown that the fully dealloyed pure-PtNWs show high activity for ORR\n\n, which can be largely attributed to their defective surface featuring rich atomic vacancies and strain\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. As we demonstrated with pure-PtNWs both experimentally and theoretically, these surface features can also contribute to improved activity for HER, MOR and EOR when compared with the Pt/C reference. Taking a step further, the current study further explores single-atom decoration as a general strategy for tailoring the local electronic structure of Pt catalysts to achieve further enhanced specific SA for a series of technological relevant electrochemical reactions with little or no sacrifice of the surface area, and thus delivering optimized MA, which is critical for practical applications. The significant enhancement of MA for various electrocatalytic systems clearly demonstrates that the surface decoration with single atoms offers an effective and general strategy for tailoring precious metal catalysts for diverse reactions. This strategy of single-atom decoration, by interrupted dealloying, can be expected to be applicable to other dopant elements such as Fe, Co or Cu species.\nWe should also note that the single-atom tailoring of Pt nanocatalysts is also conceptually distinct from typical single-atom catalysts intensively explored recently. In a typical single-atom catalyst, single metallic atoms are often dispersed on a host substrate with the single metal atoms functioning as the primary active sites\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. In contrast, in our case, single metal atoms decorate the surface of precious metal Pt catalysts to modify the local atomic configuration and electronic structures of the surrounding Pt atoms, thus tailoring their catalytic activity for specific reactions. Here, single metal atoms are not the primary active sites but play a critical role as a promoter to enhance the activity of the Pt-based catalysts without significantly blocking the surface active sites, thus defining a general strategy for creating multifunctional electrocatalysts with optimized surface area, SA and MA at the same time.\n\nSynthesis of PtNi alloy nanowires\nAll chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. In a typical synthesis, 20 mg Pt(acac)\n\nand 40 mg Ni(acac)\n\nwere mixed with 130 mg glucose, 1.7 mg W(CO)\n\nand 60 mg PVP-40 in a glass vial, with 5 ml of oleylamine and octadecene (3:2 volume ratio) as co-solvent. The mixture was heated to 140 °C for 6 h to form Pt–NiO core–shell nanowires. The resulting nanowires were collected via centrifuge at 7,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After loading the nanowires on carbon black, the catalysts were then annealed under 450 °C in argon/hydrogen (97:3) atmosphere for 12 h to obtain the PtNi alloy nanowires supported on carbon black."

The results are presented in \nalong with the catalytic performances of state-of-the-art HDO catalysts for the conversion of\np\n-cresol or other phenols into aromatics for comparison. Most of the HDO reactions with ruthenium-based catalysts reported in the literature\n\n,\n\n,\n\nwere studied at a temperature higher than 200 °C (entries 1–3 in \n). A higher activity was observed for isolated cobalt atoms doped into MoS\n\nmonolayers\n\n(Co-\nS\nMoS\n\n, entry 4), but the H\n\npressure required was 30 bar. Although extremely mild conditions were used for ruthenium catalysts modified by a C,N matrix (entry 5), alicyclic compounds rather than aromatics were the main products\n\n,\n\n. As seen in entry 6, our Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst showed similar toluene selectivity at a similar temperature and lower H\n\npressure. Remarkably, if 6 bar N\n\nwas added to the gas mixture as a complementary gas, the conversion increased as well as the toluene selectivity (entry 7). N\n\nwas used as a complementary gas in a previous study (entry 2)\n\n, but its catalytic effect was not studied. Because N\n\nis widely considered to be inert in the HDO reaction, we have devoted considerable efforts to trying to unravel the origin of the N\n\npromoting effect.\nTo identify catalytic trends inherent to the Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst, HDO of\np\n-cresol was conducted under conditions that produce a low and constant conversion of 10% in a region free of external (Supplementary \n) and internal (Supplementary Note\n\n) mass transport limitations. As shown in the left-hand columns in \n(the data are presented in Supplementary \n), a 1.5-fold higher toluene selectivity and 4.3-fold increase in HDO activity were observed in the presence of N\n\n. The promoting effect of N\n\nin the HDO reaction was also verified at a constant conversion of 21% (two right-hand columns in \n). The production of toluene follows a direct deoxygenation pathway with the formation of methylcyclohexane as an over-hydrogenation product of toluene and 4-methylcyclohexanone and 4-methylcyclohexanol as hydrogenation products of\np\n-cresol (Supplementary \n), which is in agreement with a previous report\n\n.\n\n-cresol using the Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst.\nComparison of the conversion and selectivity with or without N\n\nin the batch reaction.\na\n, Comparison at two different conversions, reaction conditions:\np\n-cresol (0.195 mmol), Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst (25, 10, 25 and 25 mg from left to right columns), decalin (8 ml), 160 °C, reaction time (1, 1, 4 and 1 hour from the left to right columns), system pressure of 1 bar H\n\nand 6 bar He (or 1 bar H\n\nand 6 bar N\n\n), mixture stirred at 600 r.p.m.\nb\n, Comparison at various H\n\npressures, reaction conditions:\np\n-cresol (0.195 mmol), Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst (25 mg), decalin (8 ml), 160 °C, 1 hour, system pressure of 1–6 bar H\n\nand 6 bar He (or 1–6 bar H\n\nand 6 bar N\n\n), mixture stirred at 600 r.p.m.\nc\n, Comparison at various N\n\npressures, reaction conditions:\np\n-cresol (0.195 mmol), Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst (25 mg), decalin (8 ml), 160 °C, 1 hour, system pressure of 1 bar H\n\n, 6 bar He and 0–6 bar N\n\n, mixture stirred at 600 r.p.m.\nd\n, Comparison of the conversion and selectivity with or without N\n\nin the fixed-bed reaction.

In our work we observed that the ruthenium was oxidized before it was loaded into the batch reactor (Supplementary \n), therefore ruthenium oxidation, its reducibility and the effect on HDO activity were considered worthy of further investigation. Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst unexposed to air was prepared (Supplementary \n) and compared with the catalyst exposed to air (3 hours and 3 days) in the HDO of\np\n-cresol. The catalytic results show that there is no obvious difference between the catalyst not exposed to air and that exposed to air (Supplementary \n), suggesting that the oxidized ruthenium can be reduced at the reaction temperature, as demonstrated by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR, Supplementary \n) and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Supplementary \n)\n\n. Thus, these results suggest that the surface oxygen on ruthenium had an insignificant effect on the reaction mechanism during the reduction time. After the effect of ruthenium oxidation was excluded, the contribution of water was studied for its promoting effect in the HDO reaction\n\n. The catalytic reaction with different amounts of water showed no obvious difference (Supplementary \n), which is probably due to the non-polar solvent (decalin) inhibiting the effect of water.\nThe promoting effect of N\n\nin the HDO reaction was investigated under various H\n\nand N\n\npressures. With increased H\n\npressure, the toluene selectivity \n) as well as its yield (Supplementary \n) promoted by N\n\nbecame less pronounced. The reaction order for H\n\nover the Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst was measured to be –0.57 in the presence of 1–3 bar H\n\n(Supplementary \n). The negative value could be attributed to hydrogen adatoms on the ruthenium surface from hydrogenolysis suppressing the adsorption of N\n\nand thus inhibiting the N\n\npromoting effect, which is consistent with the hydrogen poisoning effect observed in ammonia synthesis\n\n. The preferential adsorption of H\n\nwas also confirmed by the observation of the higher selectivity for hydrogenation products under higher H\n\npressure. With increased N\n\npressure from 0 to 4 bar, the conversion increased gradually and the toluene selectivity increased from 66.0 to 88.1% \n). It is known that the reaction order for N\n\nis between 0.8 and 1.0 for ammonia synthesis over conventional ruthenium-loaded catalysts and is smaller for a catalyst with stronger N\n\ndissociation ability\n\n. In this work, the HDO reaction order for N\n\nwas estimated to be in the range of 0.38–0.98 (Supplementary \n), although strictly it is inappropriate to call it the ‘HDO reaction order’ because nitrogen is not incorporated into the reaction products. This result implies that N\n\nis activated on Ru/TiO\n\nwith the formation of active species that provide a lower activation barrier for the overall HDO reaction. The nature of the active species and proposed mechanism for the N\n\nactivation is discussed later. Interestingly, the conversion and toluene selectivity started to decrease when the N\n\npressure was further increased. The reaction rate is a function of the concentration of all surface species, which include N\n\n, H\n\n,\np\n-cresol and toluene. So the decrease in rate could be due to a higher surface coverage of N\n\ncompared with\np\n-cresol.\nBesides the N\n\npromoting effect in the batch reaction, we also investigated the N\n\npromoting effect in a fixed-bed reaction. The reaction was carried out at constant total pressure (7 bar) and constant H\n\npartial pressure (1 bar), while the complementary gas was changed between 6 bar N\n\nand 6 bar He for three successive cycles. As shown in \n, a higher toluene selectivity (1.2-fold higher for the first cycle) and conversion were observed in the presence of N\n\n, whereas the selectivity of the other products did not change significantly. The results of the fixed-bed reaction show the efficiency of N\n\nin promoting the HDO reaction. Although the catalytic results for the batch and fixed-bed reactions are difficult to compare directly, mainly due to a different contact time (Supplementary Note\n\n), both of the reaction systems show higher toluene selectivity in the HDO of\np\n-cresol with N\n\n. The Ru/TiO\n\nretained its particle size after reaction, as revealed by STEM imaging (Supplementary \n). The long-term stability of the N\n\npromoting effect still remains to be investigated from an industrial perspective.\nUnderstanding N\n\npromotion of the catalytic HDO reaction\nTo clarify the origin of the N\n\npromoting effect in catalytic HDO, the kinetics of the HDO reaction with and without N\n\nwere studied. The catalytic results were obtained at conversions below 20%; the observed product distribution at this low conversion level could fingerprint the intrinsic reaction kinetics. Arrhenius plots were obtained by least-squares linear fitting of ln(rate of toluene production) versus 1/\nRT\n\n). In the absence of N\n\n, Ru/TiO\n\nexhibited an apparent activation energy (\nE\na\n) of ~0.97 eV for the HDO of\np\n-cresol, in good agreement with the reported results\n\n. Remarkably, in the presence of N\n\n, the\nE\na\nwas reduced significantly to ~0.58 eV. This finding suggests that the adsorption of N\n\nwith the formation of active species on Ru/TiO\n\ndecreases the activation energy and thus promotes the catalytic activity for the HDO reaction.\n\n, Arrhenius plots of Ru/TiO\n\nwith and without N\n\n. Reaction conditions for the batch reaction:\np\n-cresol (0.195 mmol), Ru/TiO\n\n(10 mg), 160–190 °C, 1 bar H\n\nand 6 bar He (or 1 bar H\n\nand 6 bar N\n\n), 1 hour, decalin (8 ml), mixture stirred at 600 r.p.m. Error bars represent the standard deviation from three independent measurements.\nb\n, In situ N XANES spectra of Ru/TiO\n\non exposure to N\n\n/H\n\n(v/v, 3:1) at 120, 180 and 240 °C.\nc\n,\nd\n, In situ FTIR spectra of the Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst in the presence of N\n\nand H\n\nrecorded in the ranges (\nc\n) 3,800−3,000 cm\n−1\nand\n(d\n) 1,800−1,400 cm\n−1\nat a pressure of 7 bar with a stoichiometric N\n\n/H\n\nratio of 6:1 at 160, 180 and 200 °C.\ne\n,\nf\n, In situ time-resolved FTIR spectra of the Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst on exposure to\np\n-cresol at 160 °C at 7 bar recorded in the ranges (\ne\n) 3,750−2,750 cm\n−1\nand (\nf\n) 1,700−1,100 cm\n−1\nat a pressure of 7 bar with a stoichiometric N\n\n/H\n\nratio of 6:1. From bottom to top, a−l: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300 and 330 s.\nFull size image\nTo study the formation of active species associated with N\n\nadsorption, in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and in situ Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements were carried out and the results show that N\nx\nH\ny\nspecies (\nx\n= 1, 2,\ny\n= 1, 2) were formed on the surface of Ru/TiO\n\nunder the reaction conditions. The in situ XANES results are shown in \n. The existence of N\nx\nH\ny\nspecies on the surface of Ru/TiO\n\nunder the reaction conditions is shown by the presence of absorptions (centred at 398.1 and 401.0 eV) arising from transitions from the K shell (N 1\ns\n) to the unoccupied\nπ\n* orbital, and absorptions (centred at 405.5 and 413.0 eV) from transitions into the\nσ\n* orbital\n\n. The intensities of the absorption peaks centred at 401.0, 405.5 and 413.0 eV decrease with temperature, which is presumably associated with the desorption of molecular N\n\nat increased temperature. By contrast, the absorption peak at 398.1 eV, which can be ascribed to the =N– group in the N\n\nH\nx\nspecies, exhibits an intensity enhancement with temperature. This indicates a dominance of an asymmetric species such as N\n\nH\n\n, which is in good agreement with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations reported below, which showed that it is kinetically more favourable for N\n\nH\n\nto form on the Ru/TiO\n\nsurface than a symmetric species such as N\n\nH\n\n.\nThe in situ FTIR results are shown in –f\n. In the presence of N\n\nand H\n\non Ru/TiO\n\n,d\n), the IR bands at 3,375 and 3,478 cm\n−1\ncould be assigned to the ν(N–H) stretching vibrations of N\nx\nH\ny\nspecies, and the primary IR band at 1,623 cm\n−1\ncould be tentatively attributed to the ν(N=N) stretching of N\n\nH\nx\nspecies\n\n, whereas no IR band was observed at atmosphere pressure (Supplementary \n). Moreover, the intensity of the ν(N=N) IR band at 1,623 cm\n−1\nincreased gradually with elevated temperature, which is consistent with the results from in situ nitrogen XANES measurements. It is generally accepted that the O−H deformation vibration of surface hydroxy groups is located at 1,630 to 1,660 cm\n−1\n. To exclude the possibility that the IR band at 1,623 cm\n−1\noriginates from the vibration of O−H, a set of experiments were executed, including introducing only H\n\n(Supplementary \n) into the reaction system, H\n\nO chemisorption (Supplementary \n) and D\n\nO chemisorption (Supplementary \n) over a fresh Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst, D\n\nisotope-exchange experiments (Supplementary \n) and N\n\nisotope-exchange experiments (Supplementary \n). According to the variation of vibrations associated with N\nx\nH\ny\nand O−H species, the results of the above experiments suggest that the IR vibration band at 1,623 cm\n−1\ndoes not derive from the deformation vibration of the O−H bond, but can probably be attributed to N\n\nH\nx\nspecies.\nTo study the role of N\n\nH\nx\nspecies in the HDO reaction, in situ FTIR experiments were carried out on Ru/TiO\n\nin the presence of the catalytic reaction substrate (\np\n-cresol). As shown in ,f\n, with the introduction of\np\n-cresol vapour at 160 °C at 7 bar, three different types of variation were observed. The bands of surface hydrogenated nitrogen species (N\n\nH\nx\n) at\n∼\n1,623 cm\n−1\ndisappeared and the IR band at\n∼\n3,614 cm\n−1\nshowed a small change. A series of new bands were observed at\n∼\n3,020,\n∼\n2,919,\n∼\n2,862,\n∼\n1,431 and\n∼\n1,357 cm\n−1\nassigned to ν(C–H) of the phenyl ring, asymmetric ν\nas\n(CH\n\n) stretching vibration, symmetric ν\ns\n(CH\n\n) stretching vibration, asymmetric δ\nas\n(CH\n\n) and symmetric δ\ns\n(CH\n\n) bending vibration, respectively; moreover, ν(C–C) vibrations of the phenyl ring were also observed at\n∼\n1,611,\n∼\n1,598,\n∼\n1,507 and\n∼\n1,462 cm\n−1\n. The IR bands at\n∼\n3,279 and\n∼\n1,227 cm\n−1\n, which relate to the stretching vibration of the O–H and C–O bonds of\np\n-cresol, respectively, were not detected 30 seconds after the introduction of\np\n-cresol, indicating that only toluene was adsorbed on the surface of the Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst. Afterwards, the IR bands at 3,279 and 1,227 cm\n−1\ngradually increased, as shown in \n(b–l),f(b–l), owing to the surface N\n\nH\nx\nspecies being consumed accompanied by the adsorption of\np\n-cresol over the surface of the Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst with time. The above results suggest that the adsorbed N\n\nH\nx\nspecies on the surface of ruthenium react with\np\n-cresol to produce toluene (the surface hydrogenated nitrogen species directly participate in the C–O hydrogenolysis reaction). Notably, the IR ν(Ti–OH) band at\n∼\n3,614 cm\n−1\nshows inconspicuous change, indicating that surface hydroxy groups do not react efficiently to form H\n\nO under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, in contrast to the small change in the IR band at\n∼\n3,614 cm\n−1\n, the IR band at\n∼\n1,623 cm\n−1\ndisappeared after the introduction of\np\n-cresol. This also demonstrates that the vibration at\n∼\n1,623 cm\n−1\ndoes not correspond to the deformation vibration of the O–H bond.\nIn addition, it has been reported that small molecules with amine groups, such as ethylenediamine\n\nand 4-aminobenzylamine\n\n, adsorbed on metal catalyst surfaces could influence the electronic structure of the metal surface by electron donation and thus control the catalytic properties. To investigate whether the formation of N\n\nH\nx\nspecies changed the electron structure of the ruthenium surface, in situ XPS measurements were conducted (Supplementary \n). The photoemission features of ruthenium showed no shift after the adsorption of N\n\nat elevated temperature. A previous study\n\nalso revealed no change in the ruthenium chemical shifts following N\n\nadsorption. These studies indicate that the electronic structure of surface ruthenium is not influenced by the formation of N\n\nH\nx\nspecies. The experimental data suggest that the main role of N\n\nH\nx\nspecies in promoting HDO is not to tune the electron structure of Ru/TiO\n\n, but possibly to chemically interact with the reactants or intermediates during the HDO reaction.\nFirst-principle calculations\nDFT calculations were performed in an effort to illustrate the role of N\n\nand deduce the possible reaction mechanism. A Ru\n\ncluster on an anatase TiO\n\n slab was adopted as the computational model (Supplementary Data\n\n). A Ru\n\nmoiety was selected because it has two layers of atoms 0.8 nm in diameter (Supplementary \n)\n\n, which is a good model to represent the structure of Ru/TiO\n\nobserved in the TEM image. Anatase TiO\n\n was selected on the basis of the structural results of the XRD analysis [\nshows the peak at 2\nθ\n= 25.3°] and the HAADF-STEM images, the structure of which was well studied\n\n. All the charge transfer from the Ru\n\ncluster to the TiO\n\ninterface led to partial oxidation of the ruthenium atoms; the charge on the Ru\n\ncluster increased to +1.8 |\ne\n| on the basis of a Bader charge analysis, which promotes the π–\nd\ntype adsorption of\np\n-cresol to –1.61 eV upon charge transfer with a strong metal–support interaction. Previous work demonstrated that there is no so-called B5 site on the surface of small ruthenium clusters (<2 nm), which is where dissociative adsorption occurs\n\n. As shown in ,b\n, the N\n\ndissociative barrier is as high as 1.48 eV on the Ru\n\ncluster, but the barrier for associative hydrogenation of N\n\nto N\n\nH\n\nis only 0.79 eV, which is possible under the reaction conditions. This result agrees well with the\n\nN\n\nisotope results, which showed that dissociative adsorption of N\n\nwas not favourable over Ru/TiO\n\nunder the reaction conditions (Supplementary \n). In addition, side-on adsorption is important to activate N\n\nby back donation of an electron from the 3\nd\norbital of the metal to the\nπ\n* orbital of N\n\n, which could reduce the bond order of the triple bond of N\n\n(\n). Further hydrogenation of N\n\nH\n\nto HNNH has a barrier of 1.21 eV with an endothermic energy of 0.20 eV. Such an endothermic process has also been observed in other hydrogenation reactions\n\n. The N–N bond length is elongated from 1.34 Å in N\n\nH\n\nto 1.39 Å in N\n\nH\n\n, and the net charge of dinitrogen decreases from –1.88 to –2.69 |\ne\n|. For comparison, the pathway for the hydrogenation of N\n\nH\n\nto NNH\n\nis more difficult, with a barrier of 1.91 eV. Further hydrogenation of N\n\nH\n\nto N\n\nH\n\nneeds to overcome a barrier of 1.38 eV with an endothermic energy of 0.42 eV, which is more difficult under the HDO reaction conditions (Supplementary \n). Thus, the calculations show that the reduction of N\n\ndoes not follow a dissociative pathway but an associative one, with the most probable product being N\n\nH\n\n.\n\n, Reaction energy profiles and the corresponding structures for N\n\ndissociation (red curve), hydrogenation on Ru\n\n/TiO\n\nto NNH\n\n(blue curve) or to HNNH (black curve).\nc\n, Illustration of the proposed reaction mechanism for N\n\nactivation and the HDO reaction. Colour code of the spheres: Ru (light orange), Ti (light grey), O (red), N (blue), C (dark grey) and H (white).\nFull size image\nThe formation of N–H bonds in N\n\nH\nx\nspecies provides a different reaction pathway for the HDO process in addition to simple hydrogenation with H\n\n. We therefore can compare the reaction mechanism with and without N\n\nH\nx\nspecies \nand Supplementary \n). Low-coordinated ruthenium atoms are plentiful at the corner sites of small ruthenium clusters, where\np\n-cresol binds with the ruthenium atoms through π→\nd\ndonation with an adsorption energy of around –1.61 eV. The dissociation barrier for a C\naromatic\n–O bond is 0.88 eV with the OH group migrating to an adjacent ruthenium site. The energy change for this step is about –0.98 eV, so the formed OH group is relatively stable on the ruthenium cluster and it is difficult for the hydride (H\nδ\n–\n) atoms on ruthenium, which derive from H\n\ndissociative adsorption, to remove the OH group. The calculated barrier for the step OH + H → H\n\nO on the ruthenium cluster is as high as 1.63 eV because of unfavourable repulsion between the negatively charged OH groups (–1.52 |\ne\n|) and hydride (–0.26 |\ne\n|). For comparison, in the step involving removal of the OH group, when N\n\nH\nx\nis introduced into this system, it provides extra protic hydrogen (H\nδ\n+\n, Bader charge of +1.00 |\ne\n|) to eliminate the OH groups from the ruthenium surface by overcoming a much lower barrier. The reaction between *OH and *NNH has a low barrier of 0.42 eV and an exothermic reaction energy of −0.04 eV, and the reaction between *OH and *HNNH also has a low barrier of 0.41 eV and an exothermic reaction energy of –0.16 eV. Finally, the C\naromatics\nobtained by capture of another H from the ruthenium surface to form toluene has a barrier of 0.68 eV. The rate-determining step for the HDO process without N\n\nassistance is the hydrogenation of the OH group with a barrier of 1.63 eV, whereas with N\n\nassistance and N\n\nH\n\nformation, the barrier for OH hydrogenation is decreased significantly, leading to N\n\nhydrogenation as the rate-determining step. It is worth mentioning that the formed N\n\nH\n\ncan reversibly convert into N\n\nand H\n\non the ruthenium surface due to the low value of\nE\na\n, with an equilibrium being established. In the presence of\np\n-cresol, it is plausible that the produced N\n\nH\n\ncould be largely consumed, which promotes N\n\nH\n\nformation. Note that at the Ru/TiO\n\ninterface, H\n\nO and the OH group could also accelerate C–OH dissociation. The activation barrier is only 0.33 eV, but the regeneration of such interface H\n\nO is a strongly endothermic step of about 0.96 eV (Supplementary Table.\n\n), which is similar to the values reported previously\n\n. We also considered the migration of the OH group from ruthenium to TiO\n\n. The calculated barrier for the diffusion of OH from ruthenium to a bare Ti site at the interface is only about 0.60 eV, but the regeneration of the interface titanium site by H\n\nO formation needs to overcome a much higher barrier of about 1.41 eV (Supplementary \n). The original catalytic activity without N\n\ncould be attributed to interface reactions. The origin of the N\n\npromoting effect of the catalytic activity in the HDO reaction is proposed in \n, in which N\n\nH\nx\nspecies are produced by N\n\nactivation (left part in \n), which provide protic hydrogen to hydrodeoxygenate\np\n-cresol (right part in \n).\nDiscussion\nWe have investigated whether the N\n\npromoting effect is a generalized phenomenon for other ruthenium-based catalysts with different supports (Ru/TiO\n\n, Ru/Al\n\nO\n\n, Ru/ZrO\n\nand Ru/C). All the catalysts were synthesized by the wet-impregnation method (see\n\nMethods\n) except Ru/C, which was supplied by Alfa Aesar. The loading of ruthenium was determined by ICP-AES analysis (Supplementary \n) and the ruthenium particles were determined to be in the nano-size regime (Supplementary \n). An increase in HDO activity in the presence of N\n\nwas observed over these catalysts with various supports (Supplementary \n), with TiO\n\nexhibiting a higher selectivity and conversion promoted by N\n\n.\nOur experimental and theoretical studies have shown that associative N\n\nreduction by reaction with H-containing species provide N\n\nH\nx\nspecies that help to promote the conversion of\np\n-cresol into toluene over a series of ruthenium catalysts supported on various metal oxides or carbon. In our work, the proposed mechanism of N\n\nreduction is different from the mechanism of ammonia production over supported ruthenium nanoparticles, which has been widely studied. The optimal size of ruthenium (~2 nm) on MgAl\n\nO\n\nin a typical ammonia synthesis contains the maximum B5 site (3D step sites)\n\n. By contrast, the ruthenium (~1 nm) on TiO\n\nused for the HDO reaction of\np\n-cresol in this work and the corresponding Ru\n\ncluster model, with a similar size, are apparently smaller, and contain no B5 sites\n\n. Larger particles with B5 sites may also exist in the catalyst, but their fraction is estimated to be low and thus they might exert an insignificant effect on the HDO reaction. In addition, we are not working on ammonia synthesis (typically performed at 400–500 °C), but the HDO of\n\np\n-cresol at a considerably lower temperature (160 °C), thus the temperatures applied in this work are sufficiently low that little N\n\ndissociation occurs. Also, this work is confined to special ruthenium catalysts containing small ruthenium clusters tested at low temperature to give a lower barrier for N\n\nhydrogenation than for N\n\ndissociation on the surface of the ruthenium cluster to form N\n\nH\nx\nspecies for the HDO reaction. The associative reduction of N\n\nhas also been demonstrated on other supported small metal clusters and is effective under mild conditions\n\n,\n\n. The activation of N\n\nby an associative pathway rather than by a dissociative one is reminiscent of the activation of O\n\n, in which the facile formation of OOH by an associative pathway plays a critical role\n\n,\n\n. This low-barrier associative pathway for N\n\nreduction may explain why the inert N\n\ncan have such an unexpected promoting role. In addition, competition for the same ruthenium site between H, N\n\n,\np\n-cresol and toluene may also exist under the reaction conditions and contribute to the activity enhancement in the presence of N\n\n. Hydrogen poisoning commonly takes place on ruthenium above 200 °C (\n), and any surface species, for example, N\n\nin our case, that can remove H and vacate the ruthenium site will facilitate faster adsorption of\np\n-cresol and hence a higher rate.\nIn conclusion, we have discovered an efficient strategy for promoting HDO activity over ruthenium-based catalysts by introducing N\n\ninto the reaction. These experimental and theoretical studies suggest that N\n\nmay be converted into N\n\nH\nx\nspecies, which provide protic hydrogen to assist the hydrogenation of the hydroxy group on\np\n-cresol with a lower activation energy than direct deoxygenation by H\n\n. The key steps of the proposed mechanism are illustrated in \nhighlighting the combination of N\n\nactivation and HDO reaction by using N\n\nas a hydrogen carrier. At the same time, N\n\nmay remove H, vacate the ruthenium site and facilitate faster adsorption of\np\n-cresol and hence a higher rate. Our data suggest that N\n\nshould no longer be considered as a simple inert carrier gas.\n\n.\nN\n\nis converted into NNH and HNNH over Ru/TiO\n\n, offering protic hydrogen for converting\np\n-cresol into toluene over the same catalyst.

The mixture was stirred for 1 h and then added dropwise to TiO\n\n(0.24 g). In the wet-impregnation method for preparing the catalyst, the water volume used was larger than that needed to saturate the TiO\n\nsurface, so a suspension liquid (Supplementary \n) rather than a glue-like sample was formed. The formation of the suspension liquid allowed the mixtures to be stirred vigorously for 2 h and then the sample was dried overnight in an oven at 120 °C and subsequently reduced in H\n\nat a flow rate of 20 ml min\n–1\nand a heating rate of 2 °C min\n–1\nto 400 °C, with the target temperature held for 3 h. The sample was subsequently cooled to room temperature and protected under N\n\nfor 1 h prior to removal from the tube reactor for the catalytic reactions or other tests. The other ruthenium catalysts, including Ru/Al\n\nO\n\nand Ru/ZrO\n\n, were synthesized according to similar recipes, except the support. RuCl\n\n, Ru/C, TiO\n\n, Al\n\nO\n\nand ZrO\n\nwere purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\nHigh-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy\nAn aberration-corrected JEOL ARM300 CF microscope operated at 300 kV in STEM mode was used for characterization of the microstructure. The convergence angle of the probe was 26 mrad (30 μm condenser aperture) with imaging performed at a camera length of 9 cm. The scattered electrons between 77 and 210 mrad [annular dark-field (ADF) signal] and between 13 and 28 mrad [annular bright field (ABF) signal] were collected by using this configuration. Energy-dispersive X-ray elemental maps and spectra were collected by using a windowless Oxford Instruments XMAX 100 TLE silicon drift detector. For STEM imaging, the probe current used was around 25 pA. The probe current was increased to around 500 pA for EDX elemental mapping.\nPowder X-ray diffraction\nPowder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were obtained on a PANAnalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer in reflection mode at 40 kV and 40 mA by using Cu Kα radiation.\nFourier-transform infrared spectra of pyridine adsorption\nFTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. A self-supporting pellet prepared with a 200 mg sample (20 wt% Ru/TiO\n\nwas mixed with KBr) was placed in the flow cell and evacuated at 673 K for 2 h. After cooling the sample temperature to 150 °C, the background spectrum of the sample was recorded. Pyridine vapour was adsorbed on the sample for 30 min at 150 °C followed by desorption at 150, 175, 200 and 250 °C for 30 min, respectively, and the spectrum of the sample was recorded between each temperature ramp. The spectral bands at 1,605 and 1,450 cm\n−1\nwere used to identify the Lewis acid site.\nCatalysis testing in the batch reaction\nUsing the hydrodeoxygenation of\np\n-cresol over Ru/TiO\n\nwith the incorporation of N\n\nas an example,\np\n-cresol (0.195 mmol) was loaded into a stainless-steel Parr autoclave (reactor volume, 50 ml) with decalin (8 ml) and Ru/TiO\n\n(2.5–50 mg). After the autoclave was sealed, it was cleaned with N\n\nthree times and purged with 6 bar N\n\nand then 1 bar H\n\nat room temperature. The reaction was carried out at 60–240 °C for 1–24 h with stirring at 600 r.p.m. After completion of the reaction and cooling to room temperature, the products were collected and qualitatively analysed by gas chromatograph–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and quantitatively analysed by a flame ionization detector (GC–FID) using an external standard method. The composition and pressure of the gases maybe changed depending on the reaction.\nCatalysis testing in the fixed-bed reaction\nThe fixed-bed reactions were performed in a reactor in FlowCAT mode supplied by HEL (HEL is a company that specializes in research and pre-pilot scale chemical reactors and systems). The Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst (100 mg) was located in the middle of the tubular reactor with quartz wool plugs on both sides. The liquid feed (\np\n-cresol dissolved in decalin at a concentration of 1.12 mg ml\n–1\n) was fed into the reactor by using a HPLC pump at a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml min\n−1\n. The N\n\n/H\n\nmixed gas and H\n\ngas were alternately passed through the reactor in the downward direction at a velocity controlled by mass-flow controllers, with N\n\nand H\n\nflow rates of 10 and 30 cm\n\n(STP) min\n–1\n, respectively, and a total pressure of 8 bar mixed gas (2 bar H\n\n+ 6 bar N\n\n) or 2 bar H\n\n, respectively. The flow rates were calibrated by using a soap film bubble flowmeter. The weight hourly space velocity was maintained at 0.134 h\n–1\n. The reaction was carried out at 180 °C. The products were collected and qualitatively analysed by GC–MS and quantitatively analysed by GC–FID using an external standard method.\nGas chromatograph analysis\nGas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and gas chromatograph-flame ionization detector (GC–FID) analyses were conducted simultaneously by using an Agilent gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent 19091N-133 column of mode HP-INNOWax with high polarity, 30 m×250 μm×0.25 μm connected column splitter that connects to the mass spectrometer and FID. The GC oven was programmed as follows: hold at the initial temperature of 313 K for 5 min, ramp at 15 K min\n–1\nto 523 K and hold at 523 K for 5 min. The peaks were analysed by comparing the spectra with the corresponding spectra of the NIST 2011 MS library.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements\nXPS measurements for investigation of the degree of oxidation of Ru/TiO\n\nand its reduction ability at increased temperature were performed by using an Axis Ultra Imaging Photoelectron Spectrometer (Kratos). The Ru/TiO\n\ncatalyst was made into a small tablet (6.0 mm diameter) and placed on the sample holder. The catalyst tablet was reduced in H\n\nin the pre-treatment chamber of the XPS spectrometer at 100, 160 and 220 °C, respectively, for 0.5 h. The sample was then introduced into the ultra-high vacuum chamber for XPS measurement at room temperature. XPS measurements for the study of the adsorption of the N\n\n/H\n\ngas mixture on Ru/TiO\n\nat increased temperature were performed at the photoemission end-station at beamline BL10B at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in Hefei, China. Briefly, the beamline is connected to a bending magnet and covers photon energies from 100 to 1,000 eV with a resolving power (\nE\n/Δ\nE\n) better than 1,000. The end-station is composed of four chambers, that is, the analysis chamber, preparation chamber, quick-sample load-lock chamber and high-pressure reactor. The analysis chamber, with a base pressure of <5 × 10\n−10\ntorr, is connected to the beamline and equipped with a VG Scienta R3000 electron energy analyser and a twin anode X-ray source. The high-pressure reactor houses a reaction cell in which the samples can be treated with different gases up to 20 bar and simultaneously heated up to 650 °C. After sample treatment, the reactor can be pumped to high vacuum (<10\n–8\ntorr) for sample transfer. In the current work, the sample was treated with H\n\nat 400 °C for 3 h in the high-pressure reactor and then treated with a gas mixture of N\n\n/H\n\n(v/v, 3:1) at 120, 180 and 240 °C for 1 h, respectively, after which it was transferred to the analysis chamber for XPS measurement without exposure to air.\nIn situ X-ray absorption near edge structure measurements\nIn situ nitrogen K-edge XANES spectra of the N\n\n/H\n\nmixed gas adsorption at increased temperature were measured at the photoemission end-station at beamline BL10B at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in Hefei, China. A bending magnet is connected to the beamline, which is equipped with three gratings covering photon energies from 100 to 1,000 eV.

Here, we demonstrate that platinum single atoms on carbon carriers are substantially more stable (up to 1,073 K) than their gold counterparts (up to 473 K), enabling facile and scalable preparation and precise tuning of their coordination environment by simple temperature control. By combining kinetic analysis, advanced characterization, and density functional theory, we assess how the Pt species determines the catalytic performance and thereby identify Pt(\n\nii\n)−Cl as the active site, being three times more active than Pt nanoparticles. We show that Pt single atoms exhibit outstanding stability in acetylene hydrochlorination and surpass the space–time yields of their gold-based analogues after 25 h time-on-stream, qualifying them as a candidate for sustainable vinyl chloride production.\nYou have full access to this article via\nTsinghua University\n.\nDownload PDF\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nTracking life and death of carbon nitride supports in platinum-catalyzed vinyl chloride synthesis\n\nArticle\nOpen access\n\nCatalyst synthesis\nThe NC support was prepared via a two-step synthesis, comprising the oxidative polymerization of aniline and a subsequent carbonization step\n\n.

The electron density at each ionic step was determined self-consistently with an energy tolerance of 10\n−4\neV. A plane-wave basis set with an energy cut-off of 600 eV was used for the bulk structure optimization. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a Gamma-centred grid with a 5 × 5 × 2 k-point mesh along the reciprocal vector distances. The optimized cell parameters were\na\n=\nb\n= 3.800 Å and\nc\n= 9.708 Å, similar to values in literature using the PBE functional\n\n,\n\n,\n\nand in good agreement with experiments (\na\n=\nb\n= 3.784 Å and\nc\n= 9.514 Å)\n\n. The Pt bulk was optimized in a similar fashion using a 7 × 7 × 7 k-point mesh.\nThe bulk anatase structure was cleaved along the , , and planes to calculate surface energies, vacancy formation energies and the electronic energy and vibrational frequencies along the catalytic cycle. For surface energy calculations, stoichiometric slabs were created with the middle layers frozen to the bulk positions, and periodic images were separated by 15 Å in the\nz\ndirection. For the vacancy formation energy, electronic energy and vibration calculations, four stoichiometric layers were made with the bottom stoichiometric layer frozen to the bulk positions. The computational set-up of the slabs was similar to the bulk optimization except for the following: ionic forces were converged within 0.05 eV Å\n−1\n; a plane-wave basis set with an energy cut-off of 400 eV was used; dipole corrections were turned on; and dispersion forces were modelled using the D3 correction method of Grimme et al.

Transition states were calculated using VTST Tool’s implementation of the nudged elastic band (NEB), climbing-image NEB (CI-NEB) and dimer methods\n\n,\n\n. For the NEB and CI-NEB, the number of images was generated such that adjacent images were separated by <0.8 Å.

Three types of sites exist: Ti\ncus\nO\nbr\n/TiO\n\n, Pt–O\n\n/TiO\n\nand Pt–O\n\n/TiO\n\n. This approach allows us to model the different local environments of oxygen, which possess different thermodynamic and kinetic properties based on the presence and coordination of Pt.

Taking the FeN\n\nP-SAzyme for example, firstly, we added 6.0 mg of the FeN\n\nP-SAzyme into 1 ml of deionized water, followed\nby dispersed it evenly by ultrasonic treatment, forming the aqueous dispersions of FeN P-SAzyme. Then we took 2.5 μL of the above FeN P-\n3 3\nSAzyme dispersion and diluted it to 1 mL with deionized water to obtain 15.0 μg/mL dilution dispersion (the concentration of 15.0 μg/mL was\nchosen according to the appropriate concentration of detection line range of nanosight instrument). Then, the molar concentration of 1 mL\ndispersion of 15.0 μg/mL for FeN P-SAzyme was tested by NTA system. The content of the FeN P-SAzyme is 6.9×108 (N ) in 1 mL of\n3 3 nanozyme\nFeN P-SAzyme dispersion (15.0 μg/mL), which was determined by a nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) system for three times to offer the\n\naverage value, indicating that the number of nanozyme is 6.9×108 (N ) in the FeN P-SAzyme of 15.0 μg (m ). Next, according to\nnanozyme 3 nanozyme\nSupplementary Equation , the average mass concentration of FeN P-SAzyme was calculated to be 7.641×10-14 mol/mg (C ), which means that\n3 m\nthe molar number of nanozyme is 7.641×10-14 mol in the FeN P-SAzyme of 1 mg. In our catalytic system of 2.2 mL (V .), 0.7632 μg of FeN P-\n3 cat 3\n\nSAzyme (m ) was used. According to Supplementary Equation , therefore, the molar concentration ([E]) of FeN P-SAzyme was\nnanozyme-cat. 3\ndetermined to be 2.65×10-14 mol/L. Moreover, the molar concentration of FeN -SAzyme was calculated with the same process and calculation\n\nmethod of FeN P-SAzyme. For FeN -SAzyme, we also took 2.5 μL of aqueous dispersions of FeN -SAzyme (5.6 mg/mL) and then diluted it to 1\n3 4 4\nmL with deionized water to obtain 14.0 μg/mL dilution dispersion. The content of the FeN -SAzyme is 9.97×108 in 1 mL of FeN -SAzyme\n4 4\ndispersion (14.0 μg/mL), which was determined by a nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) system for three times to offer the average value,\nindicating that the number of nanozyme is 9.97×108 (N ) in the FeN -SAzyme of 14.0 μg (m ). Next, according to Supplementary\nnanozyme 4 nanozyme\nEquation , the average mass concentration (C ) of FeN -SAzyme was determined to be 1.183×10-13 mol/mg, which means that the molar number\nm 4\nof nanozyme is 1.183×10-13 mol in the FeN -SAzyme of 1 mg.

According to Supplementary Equation , the molar concentration ([E]) of FeN -SAzyme was calculated to be 6.14×10-14 mol/L.\n\nIn addition, we estimated the number of Fe active sites in each nanozyme based on the content of Fe in nanozymes, which was determined by\ninductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The mass fraction content (ω ) of Fe in FeN P-SAzyme and FeN -SAzyme\nFe 3 4\nare 2.59% and 1.98%, respectively.

High-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) evidenced the absence of Pd/PdO clusters on the CeO\n\npreparation\n\n. XAS at the Pd K edge was used to study the local coordination environment and chemical state of Pd. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra shown in \nexhibit an intense first Pd–O coordination shell for both samples, indicative of the oxidized nature of Pd. EXAFS data analysis (Supplementary \n) confirms the atomic dispersion of Pd in the 1PdRods and 1PdFSP samples. The EXAFS spectrum of 1PdRods was fitted using the Pd\n\npreparation, drying, impregnation and calcination of the final catalyst, FSP involves a single preparation step (Supplementary \n) and yields materials with a higher surface area (Supplementary \n). A potential drawback of the FSP method is that a part of Pd is embedded in the bulk of the CeO\n\nsupport. These doped Pd atoms should be inaccessible for surface reactions and thus would not be directly involved in CO oxidation catalysis. In the following, we link the structures of 1PdFSP and 1PdRods catalysts to their CO oxidation performance.\n\n, HAADF-STEM and EDX-mapping images of 1PdRods (\n\nexperimentally determined by mapping of the valence band as a function of incident photon energy (Supplementary \n). The intense features that appear in the valence band at photon energies of 124 and 120 eV correspond to Ce\n4+\n\nSynthesis of well-defined SACs is typically achieved by using a low loading of the metal of interest (typically below 0.05 wt%) on a support\n,\n\n. Increasing the metal loading is often detrimental to the stability of atomically dispersed atoms at elevated temperatures. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve stable SACs at the metal loadings for practical applications\n\n. Knowledge-driven design of such catalysts requires understanding of the chemical nature and dynamics of MSIs\n\n,\n\n.\nHere we demonstrate that two Pd/CeO\n\nSACs, which are similar in the as-prepared state, evolve in a different manner under reaction conditions. Isolated ionic Pd species, obtained by impregnation on the surface of CeO\n\nnanorods, undergo a swift reduction and agglomeration into metallic clusters during CO oxidation \n). Pd/CeO\n\nSACs with a high surface area can be prepared by a single-step FSP method. The surface Pd single atoms on FSP-derived catalysts show a high resistance against sintering under CO oxidation conditions \n). Analysis of the transient and steady-state CO oxidation kinetics combined with in situ NAP-XPS, DRIFTS and EXAFS revealed that isolated surface Pd\n2+\nsites are responsible for the low-temperature CO oxidation in both catalysts, whereas reduced Pd\nδ+/0\nspecies become active at elevated temperatures. By following the Ce\n4+\n/Ce\n3+\n\nCatalyst preparation\nAll the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. CeO\n\nsynthesis scheme is depicted in Supplementary \n. In brief, 25 g of NaOH (reagent grade ≥98%) was dissolved in 30 ml of demineralized water. A solution of 2.17 g of Ce(NO\n\n)∙6H\n\nO (99% purity) in 5 ml of demineralized water was prepared. Subsequently, the two solutions were poured together, and the obtained slurry was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Next, the volume was increased to ~100 ml by adding demineralized water and the slurry was transferred into a 125 ml Teflon liner. This liner was then sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave, which was placed in an oven for 24 h at 100 °C. After cooling in a water bath, the obtained precipitate was washed with five cycles of centrifugation, decantation and redispersion until a pH of ~7–8 was obtained. The resulting solid was dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 80 °C and then calcined in air at 500 °C. Subsequently, a Pd wet impregnation of CeO\n\nnanorods using Pd(NO\n\n)∙2H\n\nO as the Pd precursor was performed. An appropriate amount of Pd salt was dissolved in demineralized water (10 ml) and poured onto the calcined CeO\n\npowder. The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min at room temperature and then slowly heated to evaporate the water without boiling. The obtained solid was dried overnight at 110 °C and subsequently calcined in air at 300 °C. The calcined samples were denoted as 1PdRods and 5PdRods, depending on the intended Pd loading.\nThe FSP synthesis was performed using a commercial TETHIS NPS10 apparatus. The principal scheme of the synthesis set-up can be found in Supplementary \n. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Ce(acac)∙H\n\nO (99.9% purity) and Pd(acac)\n\n∙H\n\nO (99% purity) salts (acac, acetylacetone) in glacial acetic acid (99.7% purity), which gave rise to a 0.1 M Ce precursor solution, and the Pd molarity was varied to target a particular Pd loading. To increase the solubility of the salts, the solution was heated slightly to ~50 °C and stirred for 0.5 h. The fully transparent solution was then transferred into the syringe of the FSP set-up. The solution was injected at a feed rate of 5 ml min\n−1\ninto the methane/oxygen flame (1.5 l min\n−1\nof methane and 3.0 l min\n−1\nof oxygen). An oxygen flow of 5.0 l min\n−1\nwas used for the dispersion of the solution, which gave rise to an overpressure at the nozzle of ~2.5 bar. On pyrolysis in the flame, the NPs were formed and deposited on the quartz fibre filter in the upper part of the set-up (Supplementary \n). The powders collected from the filter were denoted as 1PdFSP and 5PdFSP, depending on the intended Pd loading.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41929-021-00621-1\nSource: main text file\n\nCeria nanorods that preferentially expose surfaces were prepared following a hydrothermal synthesis procedure reported previously\n,\n\n. Wet impregnation with palladium nitrate yielded a 1 wt% Pd/CeO\n\nsample (1PdRods, Supplementary \n). High-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) evidenced the absence of Pd/PdO clusters on the CeO\n\nsurface \nand Supplementary \n). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping confirmed a close-to-atomic dispersion of Pd in the as-prepared catalysts. To obtain Pd/CeO\n\nSACs in a single step, we employed FSP using cerium and palladium acetylacetonates as precursors (Supplementary \n). Besides being fast, robust and scalable\n\n, this approach results in crystalline CeO\n\nwith a high surface area\n\n,\n\n. As shown in \n, the FSP-derived 1 wt% Pd/CeO\n\nsample (1PdFSP) comprises small (~5 nm) octahedrally shaped ceria NPs, with preferentially exposed facets (Supplementary \n). As for 1PdRods, HAADF-STEM and EDX point to the presence of atomically dispersed Pd. The shift of the characteristic CeO\n\nXRD reflections of 1PdFSP sample towards higher angles (Supplementary \n) together with the redshift and broadening of the F\n2g\nband in the Raman spectrum (Supplementary \n) imply that some Pd\n2+\nions are introduced into the ceria lattice during the FSP preparation\n\n. XAS at the Pd K edge was used to study the local coordination environment and chemical state of Pd. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra shown in \nexhibit an intense first Pd–O coordination shell for both samples, indicative of the oxidized nature of Pd. EXAFS data analysis (Supplementary \n) confirms the atomic dispersion of Pd in the 1PdRods and 1PdFSP samples. The EXAFS spectrum of 1PdRods was fitted using the Pd\n\nO\n\nmodel (Supplementary \n), representative of the oxidized Pd single atoms on the surface of CeO\n\n(refs\n\n,\n\n). To fit the EXAFS spectrum of 1PdFSP, we used a square planar Pd\n\nO\n\nmotif, which was previously determined to be a stable structure of Pd doped in CeO\n\nby density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Supplementary \n)\n\n. A weak second-shell feature at 3.2 Å, different from the Pd–Pd distances in PdO (Supplementary \n), was observed for both samples and can be assigned to Pd–O–Ce coordination\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. To summarize, FSP presents a suitable method to prepare Pd/CeO\n\nSACs. Compared with conventional impregnation, which requires support preparation, drying, impregnation and calcination of the final catalyst, FSP involves a single preparation step (Supplementary \n) and yields materials with a higher surface area (Supplementary \n). A potential drawback of the FSP method is that a part of Pd is embedded in the bulk of the CeO\n\nsupport. These doped Pd atoms should be inaccessible for surface reactions and thus would not be directly involved in CO oxidation catalysis. In the following, we link the structures of 1PdFSP and 1PdRods catalysts to their CO oxidation performance.\n\n, HAADF-STEM and EDX-mapping images of 1PdRods (\n\na\n) and 1PdFSP (\nb\n).

Circles and solid lines represent the data and the fit, respectively.\nFull size image\nKinetics of CO oxidation\nCatalytic activity measurements of CO oxidation in the steady-state regime are presented in \n. The prepared Pd SACs are already active at room temperature and exhibit a higher activity than reference Pd-loaded catalysts (Supplementary \nand Note\n\n). Although less Pd is expected on the surface of 1PdFSP due to doping, its low-temperature activity is higher than that of 1PdRods \ninset and Supplementary \n). The CO oxidation kinetics also exhibited a lower apparent activation energy for 1PdFSP (~50 kJ mol\n−1\n, Supplementary \n) in comparison with that of 1PdRods (~60 kJ mol\n−1\n). These values are typical for CO oxidation on Pd/CeO\n\n(refs\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). A higher reaction order in CO (+0.25 versus +0.16) and a lower reaction order in O\n\n(−0.14 versus −0.08) were observed for the 1PdFSP sample \n), which implies a lower coverage of CO and a more facile oxygen activation on 1PdFSP\n\n,\n\n. The observed reaction orders for both Pd SACs are different from classical Langmuir–Hinshelwood CO oxidation kinetics on metals (negative order in CO and positive order in O\n\n), in which poisoning by CO suppresses the adsorption and activation of O\n\n. The positive reaction orders in CO point to the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, typical for reducible oxide-based catalysts, in which O\n\nactivation proceeds at the metal–support interface\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Cargnello et al. concluded that the interfacial atoms in direct contact with CeO\n\nare the most active sites for CO oxidation in Ni/CeO\n\n, Pt/CeO\n\nand Pd/CeO\n\ncatalysts\n\n. From this perspective, all surface Pd atoms in the as-prepared Pd SACs are interfacial sites, although variations in the local structure can influence the reaction mechanism. To obtain further mechanistic insights, we studied the transient responses of 1PdRods and 1PdFSP catalysts to a step change in the reactant mixture from CO + O\n\nto O\n\nunder isothermal conditions. As shown in \n, there was a sharp increase in CO\n\nconcentration for the 1PdRods sample once the CO partial pressure dropped to almost zero. This behaviour is characteristic for the oxidation of CO adsorbed on metallic sites (Supplementary Note\n\n). The CO\n\npeak is notably lower than that for the 1PdFSP sample, which points to a different Pd speciation in these catalysts under reaction conditions. Comparison of the reaction orders at elevated temperature emphasizes the mechanistic differences between the catalysts \n). For 1PdFSP, the reaction order at 175 °C remained negative in O\n\n(−0.06) and increased in CO (+1.36) compared with that at 50 °C, which indicates a facile oxygen activation and low CO coverage. The 1PdRods sample demonstrated a nearly unchanged reaction order in CO (+0.19) and an increased order in O\n\n(+0.29). We explain this difference by the participation of metallic Pd sites in the CO oxidation at an elevated temperature (Supplementary Note\n\n).\n\n, He balance, and GHSV of 60,000 ml h\n−1\ng\ncat\n−1\n).\nb\n, Reaction rate as a function of the CO or O\n\npartial pressure measured at 50 °C.

Error bars represent standard deviation of the five subsequent measurements at the given pressure. a.u., arbitrary units.\nFull size image\nAltogether, these (transient) kinetic data indicate that the Pd–CeO\n\ninterface is involved in low-temperature CO oxidation in both Pd SACs. The high-temperature CO oxidation activity of 1PdRods is probably influenced by aggregated metallic Pd species formed in situ, whose contribution is negligible in 1PdFSP. The limited stability of the supported single atoms under the operating conditions is often an issue due to the undercoordinated nature of the metal atoms in SACs\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. To link the activity and stability of the prepared Pd SACs to their structure, we employed a set of spectroscopic tools.\nStructure and dynamics of Pd/CeO\n\nSACs during CO oxidation\nThe EXAFS spectrum of the used 1PdRods catalyst shown in \nis notably different from that of the as-prepared sample \n). The decrease in the Pd–O coordination number from 3.1 to 2.6 and the appearance of an intense Pd–Pd shell at ~2.7 Å with a coordination number of ~3 (Supplementary \n) indicate a partial reduction and clustering of the initially atomically dispersed Pd–oxo species during CO oxidation. In contrast, the EXAFS spectrum of the used 1PdFSP catalyst is similar to that of the as-prepared sample, which suggests a much higher stability of the FSP-prepared SAC. This is in line with the transient step-response experiment \n) and the reaction orders at 175 °C \n), which indicated the absence of metallic and/or reduced Pd species in 1PdFSP under reaction conditions.\n\n-weighted FT-EXAFS spectra (Pd K edge) of the catalysts after one reaction run up to 300 °C for 1PdRods (left) and 1PdFSP (right).

Pd\nmet\n, Pd metal.\nFull size image\nThe observed structural dynamics of the Pd SACs calls for an in situ spectroscopy approach. We used in situ NAP-XPS to follow the surface electronic structure of the working catalysts and in situ infrared spectroscopy to probe the interaction of the surface sites with the reacting molecules. The NAP-XPS spectrum of the Pd 3\nd\ncore line shown in \nreveals that the 1PdRods catalyst contains two Pd states during CO oxidation at 50 °C. The more intense component at 337.8 eV corresponds to atomically dispersed Pd\n2+\nions covalently bonded to CeO\n\n(refs\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). The second one located at ~336 eV is attributed to small PdO\nx\nclusters with a lower average oxidation state as compared with that of bulk PdO (~337 eV; Supplementary \n)\n\n. Hence, even under mild reaction conditions, Pd single atoms supported on nanorods are prone to reduction and agglomeration. At a reaction temperature of 300 °C almost half of the Pd turned into metallic (335.4 eV) and semi-oxidized (~336 eV) Pd species, which is in good agreement with the EXAFS \n) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) (Supplementary \n) data. On the contrary, the corresponding NAP-XPS spectra for the 1PdFSP sample contain only one state of Pd—atomically dispersed Pd\n2+\nspecies—independent of the applied reaction conditions \n). According to the NAP-XPS results, the Pd speciation did not change even during CO oxidation at 300 °C.\nIn situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) using CO as a probe molecule is sensitive to the electronic structure and nuclearity of the surface metal species in working catalysts\n\n,\n\n. Consistent with our previous findings\n\n, three major CO infrared bands were observed for 1PdRods under the reaction conditions \n). The band at 2,143 cm\n−1\nis assigned to CO adsorbed on Pd single atoms bound to CeO\n\nvia two bridged oxygens (Pd\n\nO\n\n) (\n). The band centred around 2,096 cm\n−1\ncan be attributed to Pd single atoms bound to CeO\n\nvia one oxygen atom (Pd\n\nO\n\n) (\n). During the CO oxidation, additional carbonyl bands appeared at ~2,060 and ~1,900 cm\n−1\n(Supplementary \n), which can be related to semi-oxidized and metallic Pd clusters, respectively\n\n. The formation of these species can be caused by CO-assisted migration of Pd single atoms\n\n. Comparing the DRIFTS spectra of the fresh and used 1PdRods samples, we note a more pronounced contribution of bands related to metallic Pd species, in agreement with the in situ NAP-XPS data \n). In contrast, 1PdFSP exhibited only one carbonyl band at 2,143 cm\n−1\n, which corresponds to oxidized Pd single atoms, throughout the experiment. Increasing the CO partial pressure \n) did not lead to a shift in this infrared band, which indicates the absence of lateral interactions\n\n, and thereby further confirms the isolated nature of the Pd sites in 1PdFSP. The superior structural stability of 1PdFSP in comparison with that of 1PdRods reveals stronger MSIs in the former sample.\nStructure–activity relationships of the Pd/CeO\n\ncatalysts under study were established by correlating the reaction kinetics and in situ spectroscopy results. The positive reaction orders in CO observed for both Pd SACs at a low temperature (50 °C) point to the non-metallic nature of the active Pd sites\n\n,\n\n. The low-temperature performance of the 1PdRods catalyst during repeated CO oxidation runs was nearly unaffected by the increased fraction of reduced Pd\nδ+/0\nspecies formed during the first run (Supplementary \nand Supplementary Note\n\n). From this, we infer that these species do not contribute to the low-temperature activity. This is in line with the step-response experiments \n), which indicated that a substantial fraction of Pd sites in 1PdRods are poisoned by CO at a low reaction temperature. However, at elevated temperatures (>100 °C), these Pd\nδ+/0\nspecies, characterized by Pd 3\nd\n5/2\ncomponents with binding energy below 337 eV in XPS and carbonyls below 2,100 cm\n−1\nin infrared spectra, become active \n). In the 1PdFSP sample, the persistent carbonyl infrared signature at 2,143 cm\n−1\nand the spectral component at 337.8 eV of the Pd 3\nd\n5/2\ncore line confirm the oxidized nature of the Pd single-atom active sites. Together with the XAS data, these results prove that, irrespective of the reaction temperature, 1PdFSP is a structurally stable SAC.\nEffect of Pd loading\nA conventional approach to obtain stable SACs often involves decreasing the surface concentration of metal atoms down to one metal atom per support particle\n\n,\n\n. The 1PdFSP sample contains about 30 Pd atoms per particle, but the actual surface concentration of Pd is lower due to the partial inclusion of Pd into the CeO\n\nbulk. Both XPS and CO chemisorption results confirm this (Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary \n). The lower density of Pd single atoms on the surface of the 1PdFSP sample, in principle, can explain its high stability during CO oxidation. To test this hypothesis, we prepared an additional set of catalysts with a higher Pd surface density by loading 5 wt% Pd on the two used ceria supports (denoted as 5PdFSP and 5PdRods; Supplementary Note\n\n). The 5PdFSP sample displayed a substantially higher low-temperature activity than that of 5PdRods, although some PdO clusters were observed by transmission electron microscopy and reaction orders were similar to those of their 1 wt% Pd SACs counterparts (Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). In situ NAP-XPS analysis of the 5PdFSP catalyst \n) revealed that isolated Pd\n2+\nin Pd–O–Ce moieties (337.7 eV) are the dominant species in O\n\nat 300 °C. Remarkably, exposure to CO oxidation conditions below 200 °C did not change the XPS spectra of the operating catalyst (see Supplementary \nfor mass spectrometry data), whereas higher temperatures led to the appearance of a small contribution (~5%) of metallic Pd. In contrast, extensive reduction of the Pd species was observed for the 5PdRods sample already at 100 °C \n). The strong stabilization of oxidized Pd single atoms on the surface of the 5PdFSP sample is also corroborated by in situ DRIFTS data (Supplementary \n). The intensity of the carbonyl band at 2,143 cm\n−1\nremained the same, even after reaction at 300 °C. In contrast, the 5PdRods sample showed a lower intensity of the 2,143 cm\n−1\nband after the reaction as compared with that of the as-prepared state, which explains the partial loss of the low-temperature activity in the repeated reaction cycle (Supplementary \n). Noteworthy, even a much lower loading of 0.2 wt% Pd on CeO\n\nnanorods (0.2PdRods sample, Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n) did not lead to a stable Pd SAC.\n\n, Pd 3\nd\ncore-line spectra as a function of reaction conditions for 5PdFSP (\na\n) and 5PdRods (\nb\n). The total pressure in the NAP cell was fixed at 2 mbar (CO:O\n\n= 1:1).\nFull size image\nBased on the obtained results, we argue that the higher stability of Pd single atoms in FSP-derived catalysts is not related to the low Pd surface concentration. Instead, we attribute this to a stronger MSI in the PdFSP materials. As both the FSP and Rods supports exhibit preferential faceting, the effect of crystal termination cannot explain the difference between the PdFSP and PdRods samples (Supplementary Figs.\n\n,\n\n,\n\nand\n\n). The strength of the MSI has often been correlated with the redox properties of the support\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Doping with transition metals is known to influence the reducibility of ceria\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. As a fraction of the Pd atoms is doped into the CeO\n\nlattice in the PdFSP catalysts, we surmise that the superior stability of the surface Pd single atoms stems from the modified redox properties of the PdFSP samples. In the next section, we investigate the redox phenomena at the Pd–CeO\n\ninterface.\nReducibility of the Pd–CeO\n\ninterface\nWe first studied the reactivity of the Pd–CeO\n\ninterface in the Pd SACs using CO titration followed by in situ DRIFTS as depicted in Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n. In the absence of O\n\n, the Pd\n2+\nsingle atoms readily react with CO at 50 °C to form metallic species. Quantitative data were obtained by CO pulsing titration at the same temperature, according to the scheme: PdO\nx\n+ CO → Pd + CO\n\n. The [O\ntitr\n]/Pd ratio was considerably higher than unity (Supplementary \n). Assuming that Pd is atomically dispersed, it can be estimated from these titration results that two reactive oxygen atoms exist per Pd site in the fresh 1PdRods catalyst. This agrees with the DFT-supported structure of Pd\n\nO\n\n/CeO\n\n reported in a previous work (Supplementary \n) and used here to fit the EXAFS data\n\n. For the 1PdFSP sample, the same procedure resulted in three reactive oxygen atoms per Pd atom, which suggests Pd sites are of a different structure. The involvement of oxygen atoms of the CeO\n\nsupport in CO oxidation, which was indicated by negative reaction orders in O\n\n, can explain the titration results. Thus, in the following part we focus on the redox dynamics of the two components of the metal–support interface, that is, Pd and CeO\n\n.\nUsing lab-based in situ NAP-XPS, we did not observe substantial changes in the Ce\n3+\nconcentration as a proxy for the formation of oxygen vacancies under CO oxidation conditions (Supplementary \n). Although this may indicate that ceria reduction does not take place, we need to consider that short-lived reactive Ce\n4+\n/Ce\n3+\nsites can be present in low concentrations during a steady-state reaction\n\n. Moreover, as Ce\n3+\nis preferentially located in the top-most surface layers\n\n, a conventional lab-based X-ray source (Al Kα,\nhν\n= 1,486.7 eV) may not offer sufficient surface sensitivity. Therefore, more valuable information can be obtained by probing the system as a function of the reactant chemical potential\n\nand at a lower excitation energy. To follow the formation of Ce\n3+\nat the very surface, we turned to synchrotron radiation-based (resonant) photoelectron spectroscopy. Access to the low excitation energies allows in situ probing of the Pd and Ce electronic states in the outermost layers at a depth less than ~10 Å. In turn, the use of resonant photoelectron spectroscopy (RPES) offers substantially higher sensitivity to changes in the Ce\n3+\nconcentration at the very surface as compared with that of conventional Ce 3\nd\ncore-line spectroscopy\n\n,\n\n. Ce-related electronic states were characterized by analysing the Ce 4\nd\n−4\nf\ntransitions, which resonate at specific energies. The exact thresholds were experimentally determined by mapping of the valence band as a function of incident photon energy (Supplementary \n). The intense features that appear in the valence band at photon energies of 124 and 120 eV correspond to Ce\n4+\nand Ce\n3+\nstates, respectively. Off-resonance spectra recorded at 114 eV were used to estimate the Ce\n3+\n/Ce\n4+\nratios \n).\n\n,\nb\n, In situ XPS and RPES data acquired in 0.1 mbar of reactants for 1PdRods (top) and 1PdFSP (bottom): Pd 3\nd\ncore-line region (\nhν\n= 450 eV) (\na\n) and valence band region (\nb\n). The intensities of the Ce\n4+\nand Ce\n3+\nrelated features, which appear at the respective resonant energies, were used to estimate the Ce\n3+\natomic fraction.\nc\n, Pd and Ce oxidation state dynamics derived from XPS and RPES data for 1PdRods (top) and 1PdFSP (bottom).\nd\n, Evolution of Pd K-edge XANES and the CeO\n\nunit-cell parameter of a 5PdFSP sample during temperature-programmed reduction in CO (TPR-CO) monitored by in situ XAS/WAXS.\nFull size image\nAs shown in ,b\n, both Pd SACs contain exclusively oxidized Pd\n2+\nsingle atoms on a nearly stoichiometric CeO\n\nsurface (Ce\n3+\n~1%, \n) under oxidizing conditions. Exposure of the 1PdRods sample to the reaction mixture at 50 °C led to the formation of semi-oxidized Pd clusters. In contrast, the isolated Pd\n2+\nstate was preserved in the 1PdFSP sample. The high surface sensitivity of RPES resolves even subtle differences in the Ce\n3+\nconcentration under reaction conditions (11% of Ce\n3+\nfor 1PdFSP and 9% for 1PdRods). Switching the reaction feed to pure CO resulted in a deeper reduction of Pd in 1PdRods than that in 1PdFSP, in line with the DRIFTS findings (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). The reverse was observed for the Ce reduction degree. On CO exposure, 24 and 19% of Ce\n3+\nwas formed at the surface of 1PdFSP and 1PdRods, respectively. Under identical conditions the surface of the bare FSP support contained 17% of Ce\n3+\n. In line with the CO titration results, the higher concentration of oxygen vacancies confirms that Pd increases the surface reducibility of the 1PdFSP catalyst. (Supplementary \n). The high oxygen mobility at the Pd–CeO\n\ninterface can explain the strong stabilization of oxidized Pd single atoms. Altogether, these observations point to the importance of the reverse oxygen spillover from the support to Pd single atoms. In this way, the isolated ionic Pd sites can be preserved even under reducing conditions due to a sufficient oxygen supply from the support, as previously seen for Pt/CeO\n\nSACs\n\n.\nTo complete the investigation of the redox properties of the Pd–CeO\n\ninterface, we studied the 5 wt% Pd catalysts by a combination of in situ XAS and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). These bulk-sensitive techniques simultaneously probe the speciation of Pd via XANES at the Pd K edge and Ce via WAXS analysis of the unit-cell parameter, which increases on Ce\n3+\nformation\n\n. As follows from \n, for the FSP-derived sample, Pd reduction in a CO flow starts at 80 °C, whereas ceria lattice expansion, indicative of bulk Ce\n3+\nformation, is delayed. Once sufficient metallic Pd has been formed, that is, ~50% of all Pd species, Ce\n3+\nstarts to emerge at ~125 °C, as manifested by the shift of CeO\n\nreflections towards lower angles (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n)\n\n. The bulk reduction of ceria, induced by the formation of Pd metal, is another indication of reverse oxygen spillover\n\n,\n\n. Notable Ce\n3+\nformation in the bulk for the impregnated 5PdRods catalyst was observed only at ~200 °C, which points to a lower mobility of oxygen in this sample (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Importantly, thermal treatment in O\n\nor CO + O\n\ndid not lead to substantial shifts in the diffraction patterns, apart from those related to thermal lattice expansion (Supplementary \n). This is in line with the lab-based NAP-XPS findings, and emphasizes a low Ce\n3+\nconcentration under these conditions.\nTo conclude, we demonstrated that the oxygen mobility in the PdFSP system is higher both in the bulk and at the surface. Previous DFT studies predicted substantially lower barriers for oxygen vacancy formation in the vicinity of the doped square-planar Pd\n\nO\n\nstructural motif\n\n,\n\n. In turn, surface reducibility of the support is key for the stabilization of noble metals anchored in an ionic single-atom form\n\n,\n\n. Oxygen atoms spilled over from the support to Pd single atoms suppress their reduction under the reaction conditions, which is crucial to preserve the isolated nature of the Pd–oxo species. Our earlier theoretical findings\n\nrevealed that reduced Pd adatoms are prone to migration over the ceria surface and form metallic clusters inactive in low-temperature CO oxidation. Facile oxygen transport at the Pd–CeO\n\ninterface, enabled by doping of nanosized ceria with Pd, explains the stability of oxidized Pd single atoms on the surface of FSP-derived catalysts.\nDiscussion\n\nSynthesis of well-defined SACs is typically achieved by using a low loading of the metal of interest (typically below 0.05 wt%) on a support\n,\n\n. Increasing the metal loading is often detrimental to the stability of atomically dispersed atoms at elevated temperatures. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve stable SACs at the metal loadings for practical applications\n\n. Knowledge-driven design of such catalysts requires understanding of the chemical nature and dynamics of MSIs\n\n,\n\n.\nHere we demonstrate that two Pd/CeO\n\nSACs, which are similar in the as-prepared state, evolve in a different manner under reaction conditions. Isolated ionic Pd species, obtained by impregnation on the surface of CeO\n\nnanorods, undergo a swift reduction and agglomeration into metallic clusters during CO oxidation \n). Pd/CeO\n\nSACs with a high surface area can be prepared by a single-step FSP method. The surface Pd single atoms on FSP-derived catalysts show a high resistance against sintering under CO oxidation conditions \n). Analysis of the transient and steady-state CO oxidation kinetics combined with in situ NAP-XPS, DRIFTS and EXAFS revealed that isolated surface Pd\n2+\nsites are responsible for the low-temperature CO oxidation in both catalysts, whereas reduced Pd\nδ+/0\nspecies become active at elevated temperatures. By following the Ce\n4+\n/Ce\n3+\n\nand Pd\n2+\n/Pd\nδ+/0\nredox dynamics, we established that doping by Pd ions activates the lattice oxygen of the CeO\n\nsupport and facilitates a reverse oxygen spillover at the Pd–O–Ce interface. The mobility of oxygen at the metal–support interface has a strong impact on the stability and reactivity of the Pd SACs. These findings open up an alternative approach to the rational design of active and stable SACs, in which lattice oxygen can be activated by doping the support with transition metals. The insight that the speciation of the supported metal is strongly influenced by the redox properties of the support is also relevant to other catalytic reactions that involve a metal–support interface, such as methane dry reforming, the water–gas shift reaction and CO\n\nhydrogenation.\n\nnanorods undergo reduction and agglomeration into metallic clusters at elevated temperatures.\nb\n, Pd-doped sites, inherently present in FSP-derived catalysts, facilitate oxygen mobility at the Pd–CeO\n\ninterface and, via reverse oxygen spillover, preserve the oxidized Pd single-atom moieties.\nFull size image\n\nCatalyst preparation\nAll the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. CeO\n\nnanorods were prepared according to a procedure reported elsewhere\n\n,\n\n. The synthesis scheme is depicted in Supplementary \n. In brief, 25 g of NaOH (reagent grade ≥98%) was dissolved in 30 ml of demineralized water. A solution of 2.17 g of Ce(NO\n\n)∙6H\n\nO (99% purity) in 5 ml of demineralized water was prepared. Subsequently, the two solutions were poured together, and the obtained slurry was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Next, the volume was increased to ~100 ml by adding demineralized water and the slurry was transferred into a 125 ml Teflon liner. This liner was then sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave, which was placed in an oven for 24 h at 100 °C. After cooling in a water bath, the obtained precipitate was washed with five cycles of centrifugation, decantation and redispersion until a pH of ~7–8 was obtained. The resulting solid was dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 80 °C and then calcined in air at 500 °C. Subsequently, a Pd wet impregnation of CeO\n\nnanorods using Pd(NO\n\n)∙2H\n\nO as the Pd precursor was performed. An appropriate amount of Pd salt was dissolved in demineralized water (10 ml) and poured onto the calcined CeO\n\npowder. The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min at room temperature and then slowly heated to evaporate the water without boiling. The obtained solid was dried overnight at 110 °C and subsequently calcined in air at 300 °C. The calcined samples were denoted as 1PdRods and 5PdRods, depending on the intended Pd loading.\nThe FSP synthesis was performed using a commercial TETHIS NPS10 apparatus. The principal scheme of the synthesis set-up can be found in Supplementary \n. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Ce(acac)∙H\n\nO (99.9% purity) and Pd(acac)\n\n∙H\n\nO (99% purity) salts (acac, acetylacetone) in glacial acetic acid (99.7% purity), which gave rise to a 0.1 M Ce precursor solution, and the Pd molarity was varied to target a particular Pd loading. To increase the solubility of the salts, the solution was heated slightly to ~50 °C and stirred for 0.5 h. The fully transparent solution was then transferred into the syringe of the FSP set-up. The solution was injected at a feed rate of 5 ml min\n−1\ninto the methane/oxygen flame (1.5 l min\n−1\nof methane and 3.0 l min\n−1\nof oxygen). An oxygen flow of 5.0 l min\n−1\nwas used for the dispersion of the solution, which gave rise to an overpressure at the nozzle of ~2.5 bar. On pyrolysis in the flame, the NPs were formed and deposited on the quartz fibre filter in the upper part of the set-up (Supplementary \n). The powders collected from the filter were denoted as 1PdFSP and 5PdFSP, depending on the intended Pd loading."

Notably, single Pt atoms have been frequently observed on the Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst (Supplementary \n).\nTo further confirm the differences in the sizes of the platinum islands, the samples were studied by Pt L\n\nedge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)\n\n. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra confirm that platinum is mostly metallic after reduction over palladium nanoparticles (Supplementary \n). Supplementary \nshows the Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) moduli of the samples (without phase shift). The fitted interatomic distances are given in Supplementary \n. In agreement with the literature, the peaks at 2.7 Å are assigned to Pt–Pt coordination. EXAFS indicates that the Pt atoms are coordinated by both Pt and Pd atoms in the parent catalyst, while the number of the Pt–Pt bonds decreases both in the imprinted (TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n) and in the partially deactivated catalysts (Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\n).

CO FTIR demonstrates the increase in the ratio of linear to multiple CO adsorption (the numbers over the curves) with the decrease in the size of the imprinted areas.\nFull size image\nThe stability of DMAPA on Pd/SiO\n\nwas studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Supplementary \n). Adsorbed DMAPA starts to desorb at 165 °C and removal is complete by 350 °C. The weight loss corresponds to 0.16 mmol of DMAPA adsorbed over 1 g of Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst (Supplementary \n). The amount of desorbed DMAPA is almost equal to the number of surface Pd atoms. This suggests that the stoichiometric molar ratio between surface Pd atoms and adsorbed DMAPA molecules is about 1. The hydrogenation of toluene over D-Pd/SiO\n\nwas conducted in three consecutive cycles with no activity. This demonstrates the high stability of the DMAPA coverage on the palladium surface (Supplementary \n). However, calcination at 350 °C for 3 h recovers the activity of the catalyst (Supplementary \n). The regeneration of the DMAPA-poisoned Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst by treatment at 350 °C therefore means that DMAPA adsorption for modification of the surface in these palladium catalysts can be performed multiple times.\nThe peaks observed in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) N 1s spectrum of D-Pd/SiO\n\nconfirm the presence of DMAPA on the catalyst surface \n). The N 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks with binding energies of 400.2 and 401.4 eV associated with N=C and N–C species, respectively, which are attributed to the adsorbed DMAPA molecules on the palladium surface. The presence of C=N on the D-Pd/SiO\n\nsample indicates partial dehydrogenation of C–N to C=N on the palladium surface\n\n. The dehydrogenation of DMAPA on the palladium surface has been further demonstrated by FTIR \n). The FTIR absorption peak at 1,695 cm\n−1\ncorresponds to the imine groups on the surface of the D-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst\n\n. The other FTIR peaks at 2,800–3,000 and 1,500 cm\n−\n\nwere assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations of C–H bonds in DMAPA\n\n. It is worth mentioning that spontaneous dehydrogenation of amines on the palladium surface has previously been reported\n\n.\nThe poisoning of the palladium surface with DMAPA was further investigated. Temperature-programmed reaction combined with mass spectroscopy (TPR-MS) analysis confirms DMAPA desorption (fragment of\nm\n/\nz\n= 58 of C\n\nH\n\nN\n−\n, Supplementary \n) and decomposition at 185 °C with generation of dimethylamine (fragment of\nm\n/\nz\n= 44 of C\n\nH\n\nN\n−\n, Supplementary \n). Notably, no decomposition of DMAPA was observed when the Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst was pretreated with DMAPA in cyclohexane in a batch reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere at 80 °C (Supplementary \n). Moreover, solid-state NMR analysis (\n\nN,\n\nH,\n\nC) of D-Pd/SiO\n\nconfirmed the presence of DMAPA species on the palladium surface \n). The\n\nC NMR spectrum has broad resonance peaks with maxima at approximately 25, 60 and 150 ppm, which can be attributed to the internal methylene CH\n\ngroup, close to the methylated N and C atoms in the imine group. The additional narrow peak at 42.1 ppm corresponds to methyl groups and is less affected by interaction with the support\n\n. The\n\nN cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectrum exhibits a resonance peak at ~61.8 ppm, which can be assigned to the methylated amine group in DMAPA\n\n. The nitrogen peak of the imine group is very broad due to the strong interaction with palladium. The\n\nH NMR shows a broad peak between 1.3 and 5 ppm and a peak at ~6.8 ppm that could be ascribed to H linked to C and N atoms in DMAPA, respectively\n\n. Interaction of DMAPA with palladium was additionally studied by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The positive ToF-SIMS spectrum of D-Pd/SiO\n\n) contains the peaks attributed to the fragmentation of adsorbed DMAPA producing the C\n\nH\n\nN\n+\nion (58.1 u, where u is 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom) as the main signal. It is interesting to note that the negative ToF-SIMS spectrum shows an isotopic pattern attributed to PdCN\n−\n, indicating chemical bonding of the C–N group with Pd \n). Thus, DMAPA adsorbs molecularly on the palladium surface during the imprinting procedure.\nThe concept of imprinting implies the preservation of the morphology and electronic properties of the palladium nanoparticles after poisoning by DMAPA. \nsummarizes the X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and XPS (Pd 3d) data of the Pd/SiO\n\nand D-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts. Three well-resolved XRD peaks observed on both D-Pd/SiO\n\nand Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts correspond to Pd , Pd and Pd planes, respectively\n\n. The D-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst has the same X-ray diffraction pattern as the parent Pd/SiO\n\n, indicating the palladium phase has similar crystallographic properties before and after poisoning\n\n. Similar palladium morphology and particle size were also confirmed by TEM analysis ,d\n). Low-temperature N\n\nadsorption also shows similar textural properties of the catalyst before and after poisoning (Supplementary \n). The XPS Pd 3d core-level spectra of both Pd/SiO\n\nand D-Pd/SiO\n\nsamples show a dominating doublet with Pd 3d\n5/2\nbinding energy of 335.3 eV, corresponding to the metallic state of palladium \n). A small doublet with a Pd 3d\n5/2\npeak at 337.1 eV for Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst is assigned to Pd\n2+\n, indicating partial oxidation of the palladium surface under air\n\n. In the spectrum of D-Pd/SiO\n\n, the Pd\n2+\n-related doublet is shifted to lower Pd 3d\n5/2\nbinding energies of 336.6 eV. This shift could be attributed to the effect of interaction between Pd and DMAPA. The DMAPA nitrogen species with a lone pair of electrons will donate electrons to Pd, leading to Pd sites with a higher electronic density and which exhibit a lower XPS binding energy\n\n. Although the electronic properties of surface Pd have changed, most of the Pd in the nanoparticles is still in the same metallic electronic state as in the parent Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst.\n\nand D-Pd/SiO\n\n.\nb\n, Pd 3d XPS analysis of Pd/SiO\n\nand D-Pd/SiO\n\n.\nc\n,\nd\n, TEM images of Pd/SiO\n\n(\nc\n) and D-Pd/SiO\n\n(\nd\n), showing no difference in the size and nature of the palladium catalyst after DMAPA poisoning.\nFull size image\nThus, characterization and catalytic tests of Pd/SiO\n\nand D-Pd/SiO\n\nsuggest that DMAPA could effectively poison the palladium surface.\nCatalyst design by molecular imprinting\nTo investigate the possibility of molecular imprinting on Pd/SiO\n\n, toluene was selected as a template, while DMAPA was used as a poisoner. In situ FTIR analysis was used to monitor the imprinting process –e\n). The adsorption of toluene over Pd/SiO\n\n) demonstrates a set of noticeable adsorption peaks at 1,603 and 1,496 cm\n−1\ncorresponding to the breathing vibrations of the phenyl ring\n\n. According to the literature, toluene can be horizontally adsorbed over a palladium surface via the interaction between the conjugated phenyl ring and palladium planes\n\n. Next, the sample was subjected to DMAPA. Similar to the D-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst, a new infrared peak at 1,695 cm\n−\n\n, which is attributed to the C=N stretching in imine, appeared immediately after adding DMAPA. However, the peaks of toluene (1,603 and 1,496 cm\n−\n\n) were still visible, confirming the simultaneous presence of DMAPA and toluene on the palladium surface. The co-presence of toluene and DMAPA on the palladium surface demonstrates that toluene can protect at least some of the palladium active sites during DMAPA poisoning and thus can create active islands after toluene desorption, as illustrated in \n(\n). It is worth noting that when heating the sample in the presence of hydrogen at 120 °C, the intensity of the peak at 1,695 cm\n−\n\ndecreases substantially, whereas the peaks at 1,500 and 2,800–3000 cm\n−\n\nwere unaffected. This suggests that the imine groups were hydrogenated back to amine, which remains, however, still adsorbed on the palladium surface \n). Hydrogen evacuation leads to the reappearance of the imine infrared peak at 1,695 cm\n−\n\ndue to the amine dehydrogenation back to imine groups on the palladium surface \n). Notably, heating at 120 °C in the presence of H\n\nresults in the disappearance of the peaks at 1,603 and 1,496 cm\n−\n\n, indicating the desorption of the template molecules.\nThe imprinted Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts were also prepared using molecular templates larger than toluene (TL-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n), such as mesitylene (ML-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n) and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n). To distinguish the effects of imprinting and partial deactivation, partially deactivated Pd/SiO\n\n(Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\n) was prepared as a reference material. CO FTIR was used to analyse the active sites on palladium \n). The CO adsorption on the parent Pd/SiO\n\nresults in several infrared peaks at 2,074, 1,965 and 1,920 cm\n−\n\n, which correspond respectively, to linear, bridged and three-fold bonded CO (\n). The last two types of sites are mainly present over the crystal planes, while linear CO adsorption occurs mainly over isolated sites. Thus, over the initial Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst containing large palladium nanoparticles, the peak ratio of linear to multiply bonded CO (L/M) is only 0.06. The catalyst prepared by imprinting with a large template molecule (TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n) has a notably higher contribution of linearly adsorbed CO in comparison with initial Pd/SiO\n\n. This L/M ratio increases further for the smaller template molecules in the order TPB (0.17) < ML (0.2) < TL (0.22), which could be explained by the decrease in the area of the active palladium zones. The highest ratio is observed over Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\n, where only Pd atoms isolated between adsorbed DMAPA are available. The infrared peaks of CO adsorption over the DMAPA-treated catalysts have shifted to lower wavenumbers in comparison with parent Pd/SiO\n\n. This red shift further confirms the XPS results, which suggest electron donation from N to Pd\n\n.\nHigh-angular annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging in scanning TEM (STEM) mode was used for further analysis of the imprinted Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst \n). To identify the active islands, platinum was deposited on the imprinted areas. Platinum has a much higher atomic number than palladium (78 versus 46) and HAADF intensity is proportional to ~\nZ\n1.7\n, where\nZ\nis the atomic number. Therefore, Pt atoms would appear brighter on the surface of palladium particles. This contrast between the Pt and Pd atoms in HAADF images makes it possible to a certain extent to highlight the imprinted areas\n\n,\n\n. TPB ~0.85 nm in size was selected as a template for the preparation of the molecularly imprinted Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst for the STEM analysis\n\n. The deposition of Pt atoms was performed by mild reduction of Pt(acac)\n\nsolution on the initial Pd/SiO\n\n, D-Pd/SiO\n\n, TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nand Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts in the presence of H\n\n. Due to the strong hydrogen activation by palladium, the Pt atoms should be selectively reduced on the imprinted areas. No platinum reduction is expected on the DMAPA-poisoned palladium surface, where all surface Pd atoms are covered by the poisoner \n). The STEM energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images of initial Pd/SiO\n\nwith deposited Pt atoms indicate the formation of a core–shell structure with a Pd core and Pt shell of 1.4–3 nm –d\n). The formation of uniform platinum shells around palladium nanoparticles demonstrates the high activity of the palladium surface toward platinum reduction. Note that completely deactivated Pd/SiO\n\nhas a very low number of Pt atoms on the palladium surface –g\n), confirming that the palladium surface has been poisoned by DMAPA. Interestingly, molecular imprinting with TPB as a template shows no platinum shell on the palladium surface –j\n). EDS mapping clearly shows isolated platinum clusters over the palladium surface. Partial deactivation of the catalyst by DMAPA without template deposition shows uniform coverage of platinum over palladium nanoparticles without the formation of distinct platinum islands –m\n).\n\n-\np\n, HAADF images and corresponding STEM-EDS elemental maps of Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst (\nb\n–\nd\n), D-Pd/SiO\n\n(\ne\n–\ng\n), TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n(\nh\n–\nj\n), Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\n(\nk\n–\nm\n) and Used-TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n(\nn\n–\np\n).\nq\n–\nt\n, HAADF images of TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n(\nq\n) and Used-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n(\ns\n) and corresponding size histograms of the Pt islands (\nr\n,\nt\n). Deposition of Pt over the palladium surface shows the presence of imprinted areas. The white squares highlight Pt islands on the Pd surface.\nFull size image\nThe HAADF images of the imprinted areas are shown in \n. The platinum islands (showing bright) range in size from 0.6 to 1.1 nm (average, 0.8 nm). The size of the platinum islands therefore agrees with the dimensions of the TPB template molecule \nand Supplementary –c\n). The detection of platinum islands on the imprinted palladium surface provides, at least qualitatively, some additional proof for preparation of the imprinted zones of predetermined size on the palladium surface. HAADF images of Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\nshow a random distribution of DMAPA on the palladium surface with the generation of small, non-uniform Pt clusters. Notably, single Pt atoms have been frequently observed on the Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst (Supplementary \n).\nTo further confirm the differences in the sizes of the platinum islands, the samples were studied by Pt L\n\nedge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)\n\n. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra confirm that platinum is mostly metallic after reduction over palladium nanoparticles (Supplementary \n). Supplementary \nshows the Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) moduli of the samples (without phase shift). The fitted interatomic distances are given in Supplementary \n. In agreement with the literature, the peaks at 2.7 Å are assigned to Pt–Pt coordination. EXAFS indicates that the Pt atoms are coordinated by both Pt and Pd atoms in the parent catalyst, while the number of the Pt–Pt bonds decreases both in the imprinted (TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n) and in the partially deactivated catalysts (Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\n). The decrease in the Pt–Pt coordination number is consistent with the presence of platinum islands on the imprinted catalyst and homogeneously distributed isolated Pt atoms over the partially deactivated sample (Supplementary \n).\nModel reactions over the imprinted Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst\nThe prepared TL-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n, ML-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nand TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nwere tested in several model catalytic reactions. The size of each resulting imprinted area should decrease in the following sequence TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n> ML-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n> TL-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nin agreement with the decrease in the sizes of the template molecules.\nAs has been reported earlier\n\n,\n\n, hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires flat adsorption of the molecules over the metal surface. If the molecule is larger than the imprinted area, it cannot be hydrogenated because of steric hindrance during adsorption.\nThe amount of adsorbed DMAPA molecules over the studied catalysts was determined by TGA. As shown in Supplementary \n, the weight losses over Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\n, TL-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n, ML-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nand TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nwere 1.09%, 0.98%, 1.02% and 1.38%, corresponding to 0.11, 0.096, 0.1 and 0.14 mmol g\n−1\nof DMAPA, respectively. The active sites in the imprinted catalysts were measured by H\n\n-pulse chemisorption. As summarized in Supplementary \n, the cumulative H\n\nuptakes were 0.048, 0.06, 0.051 and 0.035 mmol g\n−1\nover the Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\n, TL-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n, ML-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nand TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts, respectively. The H\n\n-pulse chemisorption correlates well with the TGA. Note that higher DMAPA adsorption correlates with lower H\n\nuptake over the imprinted or deactivated catalysts \n). The slightly higher amount of bare Pd atoms calculated from H\n\nchemisorption over the imprinted catalyst could be explained by the electronic effect of DMAPA on Pd, which can increase the stoichiometric ratio of H to Pd\n\n. In addition to the H\n\nadsorption, we have performed pulse adsorption of toluene (Supplementary \n). The parent Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst demonstrates high toluene adsorption (0.028 mmol g\n−1\n), whereas no adsorption occurs over completely poisoned D-Pd/SiO\n\n. Interestingly, TL-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nshows adsorption of toluene by refilling the imprinting areas (0.005 mmol g\n−1\n). An increase in the size of imprinted zones in TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nleads to higher adsorption of toluene (0.008 mmol g\n−1\n).\n\nuptake over the imprinted or deactivated catalysts.\nFull size image\nThe turnover frequencies (TOFs) over the studied catalysts were calculated based on the H\n\n-pulse chemisorption results assuming the same intrinsic activity of all available bare Pd atoms in the hydrogenation reactions \n). The TOFs of hydrogenation of toluene, mesitylene and TPB over parent Pd/SiO\n\nin the batch reactor were 88.94, 34.04 and 53.39 h\n−1\n, respectively. The complete poisoning of the Pd catalysts with DMAPA results in a complete loss of activity, and therefore TOFs of zero for hydrogenation of all studied aromatic molecules.\n\ncatalysts in the batch reactor.

TOF measurements were performed three times for each case. The error bars represent the s.d. The relative s.d. is within 5%. The catalytic results in batch and fixed-bed reactors demonstrate suppression of hydrogenation of aromatic molecules larger in size than the template molecules in imprinted catalysts.\nSource data\nFull size image\nSurprisingly, the toluene-imprinted Pd/SiO\n\n(TL-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n) catalyst still shows a high TOF for toluene (1.96 h\n−1\n), but extremely low TOFs for the hydrogenation of mesitylene (0.08 h\n−1\n) and TPB (0.03 h\n−1\n). This phenomenon can be explained by the presence of active islands over the palladium surface created by preadsorbed toluene. In this case, the active islands on the palladium surface with the shape and size of the toluene molecule can hinder the adsorption of larger molecules such as mesitylene and TPB. This explanation has been further supported by using mesitylene as a template. ML-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nexhibits higher TOFs for both toluene and mesitylene (2.51 and 0.44 h\n−1\n) but a low TOF for TPB (0.03 h\n−1\n). Furthermore, Pd/SiO\n\nimprinted by TPB has demonstrated high TOFs for hydrogenation of toluene (4.24 h\n−1\n), mesitylene (0.82 h\n−1\n) and TPB (0.95 h\n−1\n). The increase in the size of template molecules results therefore in the expansion of active islands and hydrogenation of larger molecules. It is worth noting that the partially deactivated Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst (Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\n) exhibits different catalytic behaviour compared with the imprinted catalysts. The TOFs for toluene, mesitylene and TPB over Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst are 0.79, 0.28 and 0.32 h\n−1\n, respectively. In comparison with the imprinted counterparts, the activity is comparable for all molecules over Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\n, indicating the indiscriminating distribution of DMAPA on the palladium surface without the generation of any specific islands for the adsorption of aromatic rings. Indeed, the random coverage of the catalyst surface with DMAPA could have a positive effect on the selective and preferential hydrogenation of small molecules at higher coverage of DMAPA, when the probability of finding adjacent sites goes down. To check this effect, hydrogenation of toluene, mesitylene and TPB were performed over Pd/SiO\n\nin the presence of different concentrations of DMAPA (Supplementary \n). Although higher hydrogenation activity was observed for toluene, we did not observe any clear size-dependent effect of DMAPA poisoning for larger molecules (Supplementary \n). Thus, the size-dependent reactivity was indeed introduced by the imprinting process and is not a consequence of the electronic or poisoning effects of adsorbed DMAPA.\nThe effect of imprinting on the studied Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts was further confirmed by performing gas-phase catalytic reactions in a fixed-bed reactor to exclude the possibility of a competitive adsorption effect of desorbed DMAPA in the liquid phase on the catalytic performance \n). In agreement with the liquid-phase reactions, a remarkable imprinting effect was observed over imprinted Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst. It should be noted that no imprinting effect was observed over the Partial-D-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst.\nStability of the catalyst is one of the most important issues in catalysis. Migration of DMAPA on the palladium surface could cause these imprinted catalysts to lose selectivity. It is worth noting that adsorbates on the metal surface have often been found to be mobile under reaction conditions\n\n. Importantly, the imprinted ML-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst demonstrates stable activity in three consecutive cycles of the hydrogenation of toluene, mesitylene and TPB (Supplementary \n). Furthermore, ML-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nexhibits stable conversion for 10 h in the fixed-bed reactor in the gas-phase hydrogenation of toluene, mesitylene and TPB \n). This suggests the lack of mobility of DMAPA over the palladium surface, although other possibilities—for instance, the formation of dynamic voids—cannot be excluded at this stage. In general, DMAPA adsorption over palladium leads to irreversible deactivation of the metal catalysts due to the generation of metal–N bonds\n\n,\n\n.\nThe stability of the imprinting areas was further confirmed by characterization of the imprinted Used-TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst by CO FTIR, TEM and XAS. CO FTIR of the Used-TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nexhibited a similar L/M ratio as the fresh catalyst (0.16 versus 0.17, Supplementary \n), indicating the active palladium zones on both samples were of similar size. After platinum deposition, the same platinum islands with an average size of 0.8 nm were observed on the Used-TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nand fresh TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts –p,s,t\nand Supplementary –f\n) by TEM. The Pt L\n\nedge XANES and EXAFS of Used-TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nand fresh TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\nwere also very similar (Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). All these characterizations indicate high stability of the imprinted areas on the TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst.\nIf the molecular imprinting introduces a size-dependent effect for the hydrogenation of aromatic rings, the intrinsic catalytic activity for hydrogenation of small size C=C alkene groups, for example, in styrene, should be comparable. Analysis of styrene hydrogenation in the batch reactor shows high activity of initial Pd/SiO\n\n(TOF, 1,491 h\n−1\n) and comparable TOFs for the imprinted catalysts (883–1,053 h\n−1\n), confirming that hydrogenation of the C=C group in styrene is independent of the size of template molecule and imprinted zones (Supplementary \n).\nThe substantial decrease in the intrinsic activities for hydrogenation of all molecules after imprinting could be explained by the electronic effects of DMAPA over surface palladium sites. Adsorbed DMAPA donates electron density to the surface Pd atoms and decreases the intrinsic activity. The electronic effect could result in an increase in the activation energy for the hydrogenation of molecules in the imprinted areas. Indeed, measuring toluene hydrogenation at different temperatures over the Pd/SiO\n\nand TL-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts shows an increase in the apparent activation energy from 38.2 to 67.0 kJ mol\n−1\nafter the imprinting (Supplementary \n). The presence of electronic effects is also consistent with the decrease in the intrinsic activity for styrene hydrogenation after DMAPA poisoning (Supplementary \n)\n\n. It has been reported\n\nthat the effect of electronic donors is less important over large metal particles. To test this assumption, palladium sponge with low surface area and dispersion (0.58%, determined by CO-pulse adsorption) was used for imprinting instead of the Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst. The TOFs of toluene, mesitylene and TPB hydrogenation over the parent sponge were 25.67, 14.26 and 9.79 h\n−1\n, respectively, which is about three times lower than with the Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst and could be explained by higher activity of defect palladium sites present in smaller palladium nanoparticles used for hydrogenation\n\n. Different from imprinted Pd/SiO\n\n, the TOFs over imprinted palladium sponge were calculated on the basis of the total number of palladium surface sites, including those that had been poisoned by DMAPA \n).\nImprinting of palladium sponge by toluene results in a high TOF of toluene hydrogenation (15.86 h\n−1\n), but negligibly low intrinsic activities for mesitylene (0.79 h\n−1\n) and TPB (0.70 h\n−1\n) hydrogenation. The same effect was observed over ML-Print-Pd sponge, which resulted in high activity for hydrogenation of toluene (18.26 h\n−1\n) and mesitylene (3.82 h\n−1\n) but a low TOF for hydrogenation of TPB (1.28 h\n−1\n). Imprinting by TPB demonstrates high activity: 20.10, 6.01 and 4.65 h\n−1\nfor toluene, mesitylene and TPB, respectively. Thus, the imprinting phenomena, which introduce size and shape-selective hydrogenation, are similar on both palladium sponge and imprinted Pd/SiO\n\n. Palladium sponge possesses higher numbers of terrace sites and fewer edges and corners than Pd/SiO\n\n. It should result in higher amounts of adsorbed template molecules over continuous sites and higher quality of imprinted zones. Based on the total number of surface palladium sites, the overall activity (measured by TOF) is reduced less after DMAPA poisoning of the metal surface of the sponge in comparison with Pd/SiO\n\n(Supplementary \n). This effect can be explained by both the lower electronic effect and the higher proportion of continuous palladium sites on the sponge in comparison with highly dispersed supported palladium catalysts.\nSelective hydrogenation of benzene in the mixture\nOur results suggest that this molecular imprinting methodology can be efficiently used for selective catalytic reactions. Control of selectivity is achieved by creating an active island on the metallic surface via adsorption–desorption of the template molecules and poisoning. We demonstrate further that this concept opens perspectives for practical applications; for example, for selective removal of benzene from a mixture of aromatics. Benzene is a carcinogenic compound and its content has to be reduced to less than 1% in gasoline\n\n. Traditionally, benzene is removed by adsorption, catalytic hydrogenation and catalytic alkylation\n\n,\n\n. The adsorption process for benzene removal suffers from the limitation of the adsorption volume of adsorbents (for example, activated carbon). Catalytic alkylation consumes a large number of expensive olefins. Thus, catalytic hydrogenation could be considered a promising methodology\n\n. However, hydrogenation of the mixture of aromatics not only hydrogenates benzene but also hydrogenates other molecules. Therefore, a smart catalyst that could selectively hydrogenate benzene in a complex mixture of aromatics would be highly desirable.\nThe imprinted Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst was prepared by using benzene as a template and named Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n. The amount of DMAPA over the Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst was 0.145 mmol g\n−1\ndetermined by TGA, while the amount of bare palladium sites determined by H\n\nadsorption was 0.054 mmol g\n−1\n(Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). The TOFs for hydrogenation of various aromatics, such as benzene, toluene,\np\n-xylene and mesitylene, were measured for initial Pd/SiO\n\nand Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n. As shown in \n, after imprinting with benzene, the TOF for benzene hydrogenation decreased from 125.54 to 7.97 h\n−1\n. Importantly, the TOFs for hydrogenation of toluene,\np\n-xylene and mesitylene decreased several times more compared to benzene. These results show that Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ndemonstrates preferential behaviour for hydrogenation of benzene in comparison with other aromatic molecules.\n\n.\na\n, TOF for hydrogenation of various aromatics. The left and right\ny\n-axis show TOF numbers for hydrogenation over Pd/SiO\n\nand Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n, respectively.\nb\n–\nd\n, Selective hydrogenation of benzene mixed with toluene (\nb\n),\np\n-xylene (\nc\n) or mesitylene (\nd\n). Reaction conditions: 50–100 mg catalyst, 100 mg benzene mixed with 100 mg toluene,\np\n-xylene or mesitylene, 5 g\nn\n-decane, 120 °C, 20 bar H\n\n, 0.25–48 h. TOF measurements were performed three times in each case. The error bars represent the s.d. The relative s.d. is within 5%. Benzene can be selectively hydrogenated in a mixture with other aromatic molecules over catalysts prepared by imprinting benzene as a template.\nSource data\nFull size image\nSubsequently, we performed hydrogenation of benzene in a mixture with other aromatic molecules (benzene/toluene, benzene/\np\n-xylene and benzene/mesitylene). As shown in –d\n, the selectivity of benzene hydrogenation over Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst was spectacularly enhanced in comparison with hydrogenation over Pd/SiO\n\n. The hydrogenation selectivity depends on the size of the aromatic molecule. For example, due to the comparable sizes of benzene and toluene, the selectivity of benzene hydrogenation in the mixture with toluene demonstrates only about 10% difference (62.6% versus 73.4%) at full benzene conversion and aromatic conversions of 85.0% and 70.2% for Pd/SiO\n\nand Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n, respectively. At the same time, the selectivity of benzene hydrogenation compared to\np\n-xylene hydrogenation already notably increases for Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n(90.1%) compared with Pd/SiO\n\n(73.4%). The difference in the selectivity increases much further for the benzene/mesitylene mixture from 75.8% for Pd/SiO\n\nto almost 98.4% for Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n. The selectivity of benzene hydrogenation in a mixture with different aromatics is, therefore, a function of their molecular size.\nSelective hydrogenation of other molecules of similar molecular size to benzene has also been tried. For example, hydrogenation of pyridine mixed with mesitylene has been performed over both initial Pd/SiO\n\nand Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts. However, due to the strong interaction between pyridine and palladium, both catalysts (Pd/SiO\n\nand Ben-Pd/SiO\n\n) exhibited 100% selectivity for the pyridine hydrogenation, whereas mesitylene hydrogenation was almost completely suppressed (Supplementary \n). This could be explained by the higher basicity of pyridine in comparison with other aromatic molecules. Note that both initial Pd/SiO\n\nand Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts show similar intrinsic catalytic activity for pyridine hydrogenation (134 versus 139 h\n−1\n, Supplementary \n).\nThe concentration effect of benzene in the mixture with aromatics was further investigated. The weight ratio of benzene to other aromatics decreased from 1 to 0.5 and then to 0.1 (Supplementary \n). The imprinted Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst exhibited high selectivity for benzene hydrogenation even at the lowest benzene concentration (Supplementary ,d,f\n). These results demonstrate the potential application of these imprinted palladium catalysts for selective benzene removal from mixtures of different aromatics.\nConclusions\nWe have demonstrated a molecular imprinting strategy for enhancing the selectivity of chemical reactions catalysed by heterogeneous palladium metal catalysts. By using DMAPA as a poisoner and various aromatic molecules of different sizes, including toluene, mesitylene and TPB, as templates, we successfully prepared a series of imprinted palladium catalysts. The catalytic results demonstrate that these imprinted palladium catalysts have a size-dependent reactivity for the hydrogenation of aromatic molecules. Moreover, the imprinted palladium catalysts prepared with benzene as a template exhibited preferential hydrogenation of benzene in a mixture of aromatics. Our results prove the potential application of imprinted catalysts for selective removal of carcinogenic benzene from reformate gasoline. The molecular imprinting strategy that we describe not only provides a powerful way to design a selective catalytic surface but also offers an additional understanding of the phenomena occurring during adsorption and catalytic reactions on the metal surfaces.\n\nMethods\nMaterials\nPalladium chloride (PdCl\n\n, >99.9%), toluene anhydrous (C\n\nH\n\n, >99.5%), mesitylene (C\n\nH\n\n, >99.5%), TPB (C\n\nH\n\n, >95%), DMAPA (C\n\nH\n\nN\n\n, >99%), biphenyl (C\n\nH\n\n, >99%), styrene (C\n\nH\n\n, >99%), pyridine (C\n\nH\n\nN, 99.8%), cyclohexane (C\n\nH\n\n, 99.5%) and\nn\n-decane (C\n\nH\n\n, >99.5%) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.

The benchmark catalysts, based on Pd, still face challenges such as water poisoning and long-term stability. Here we report an approach for catalyst synthesis that relies on the trapping of metal single atoms on the support surface, in thermally stable form, to modify the nature of further deposited metal/metal oxide. By anchoring Pt ions on a catalyst support we can tailor the morphology of the deposited phase. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) rafts of PdO\n\nx\nare formed, resulting in higher reaction rates and improved water tolerance during methane oxidation. The results show that modifying the support by trapping single atoms could provide an important addition to the toolkit of catalyst designers for controlling the nucleation and growth of metal and metal oxide clusters in heterogeneous catalysts.\nYou have full access to this article via\nTsinghua University\n.\nDownload PDF\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nRobust palladium oxide nano-cluster catalysts using atomic ions and strong interactions for high-performance methane oxidation\nArticle\nOpen access\n\nCatalyst preparation\nThe initial experiments to investigate the role of atom-trapped Pt were performed with the commercial ceria (Solvay-Rhodia HS 5, also referred to as HSA ceria since it has a higher surface area than the ceria prepared by calcination of Ce(NO\n\n)\n\n, which was used for the Pd–Pt catalysts).

The characteristic hexagonal pattern of Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\n(marked by blue atoms) is accompanied by regions of enhanced\nZ\ncontrast corresponding to Pt atoms (bottom left corner of \n). The Pt atoms are situated on hcp sites of the surface of Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXene, forming rhombic patterns (marked by red circles) that are characteristic of Pt monolayers \n). The single Pt layers maximize the atom efficiency by exposing all atoms on their surface, leading to ~100% dispersion\n\n. Moreover, continuous lattice fringes across the metal–support interfaces were observed \n), indicating epitaxial growth of the Pt nanolayers on the Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXene. Detailed crystal structure analysis (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n) showed that epitaxial Pt nanolayers with an average size of ~2.2 nm aligned their planes with the planes of the MXene support, leading to an epitaxial relationship of Pt//Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXenes.\nOur experimental results suggest that the chemisorption of Pt atoms on the hcp sites of the MXene support, through metal–support bonding, can account for the formation of atomically thin Pt nanolayers. DFT calculations were thus performed to assess the interface formation energies (see Supplementary Note\n\nfor details) of Pt by three different sites on the basal plane of Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXene\n\n: Mo atop sites, face-centred cubic (fcc) sites and hcp sites \n). When Pt is coordinated on an hcp site \n), the binding of Pt is more favoured (−1.62 eV per Pt atom) than the weaker adsorption on the fcc (−1.38 eV per Pt atom) and Mo atop (−1.00 eV per Pt atom) sites (Supplementary \n). \nshows the calculated interface formation energies for Pt nanolayers and nanoparticles along with the structures in the inset figures. We found that the atomically thin Pt monolayer is the most stable structure with the lowest energy compared to the nanoparticle structures. Moreover, a comparison of the two nanoparticle geometries shows that with a decrease in the number of interfacial Mo–Pt bonds, the energy of the system increases, further illustrating the preference of Pt atoms to form single or double atomically thin layers with a maximum number of Pt atoms bonded to the MXene surface, rather than nanoparticle- or nanopillar-type structures where more Pt–Pt bonds are formed.\nCatalytic performance of Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nin NOCM\nIn a flow fixed-bed reactor, NOCM was performed over various Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts with different Pt loadings (namely, 2%, 1.5%, 1%, 0.75%, 0.5% and 0.25%; see Supplementary \nfor details). These catalysts exhibited a surface area of 26–33 m\n\ng\n−1\n, a pore size of ~3 nm and a pore volume of 0.05–0.08 cm\n\ng\n−1\n(Supplementary \n) and showed minimum loss of Pt metal during the reactions (Supplementary \n). Thermodynamically, both a low methane pressure and a high operating temperature promote the formation of the desired ethane/ethylene (Supplementary \n), as well as undesired coke precursors (Supplementary \n). From a kinetic perspective, for the series of reactions converting methane to ethane/ethylene followed by benzene/naphthalene, the effect of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was investigated as shown in –c\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n, with the results being the average of at least three independent tests. The methane conversion increased with decreasing GHSV for all catalysts. Both high Pt loading and low GHSV contributed to coke accumulation, resulting in rapid deactivation of the catalysts. Among all tested catalysts, the 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalyst exhibited the best coke-resistant property at 8.6–12.9 h\n−1\nGHSV, 750 °C, 3.5–6.5% methane conversion and >98% selectivity to C\n\nspecies.\n\nT\nx\nfor non-oxidative coupling of methane.\na\n–\nc\n, Performance of 2% Pt (\na\n), 1% Pt (\nb\n) and 0.5% Pt (\nc\n) over MXene, respectively, at 750 °C in the GHSV range of 4.3–12.9 h\n−1\n.

High C\n\nselectivity was typically obtained at low methane conversion over low Pt loading catalysts. The 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalyst remained >95% selective towards C\n\nspecies at a methane conversion of 8%, while other catalysts showed either lower methane conversion or lower selectivity towards C\n\n. The Pt dispersion, that is, the ratio of the number of surface atoms to the number of total atoms, was measured by the H\n\n–O\n\ntitration method (\n\nMethods\n), which was employed to normalize all methane conversion rates to obtain the TOF \n). The Pt dispersions were determined to be 91%, 65% and 34% for 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\n, 1% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nand 2% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\n, respectively (Supplementary \n). Increasing the Pt loading from 0.25% to 2% substantially decreases the Pt dispersions (from 97% to 34%) in Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts, suggesting that thick Pt nanostructures that promote coke deposition start to form at higher Pt loadings (>0.5%). HAADF-STEM further confirms that raft-like nanoflakes that are longer than 20 nm were formed in the high Pt loading (1% and 2%) catalysts (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). The dispersions of low Pt loading catalysts (0.25% and 0.5%) are close to 100%, indicating the formation of ATNLs, which is consistent with the results of HAADF-STEM and DFT calculations. It should be noted that all these TOF values fell within a relatively narrow range (0.2–0.6 s\n−1\n), implying similar activity of the surface Pt atoms for NOCM in all Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts. To our best knowledge, the TOFs of Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nare among the highest values for methane activation, compared with the values of 0.0005–0.05 s\n−1\nfound in the literature\n\n,\n\n,\n\n(Supplementary \n).\nTemperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) was carried out over 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nto investigate the effect of the operating temperature on product distribution. As shown in \n, methane was not efficiently activated until 600 °C. At 600–700 °C, a trace amount of ethane was found as the only product, while at 700–800 °C both ethane and ethylene were generated from methane coupling. Trace amounts of acetylene (C\n\nH\n\n) and benzene were also detectable as by-products. At higher operating temperatures (>800 °C), ethane dehydrogenation led to more ethylene as well as undesired acetylene and benzene (coke precursors), rapidly deactivating the catalyst. \npresents the mass spectrum of a sample obtained at the reactor outlet. In addition to ethane (\nm\n/\nz\n= 30) and ethylene (\nm\n/\nz\n= 28), methyl radicals (\nm\n/\nz\n= 15) were also detected. The presence of methyl radicals as an intermediate suggests that the ATNLs activate the first C–H bond of methane to form methyl radicals and two methyl radicals in the gas-phase couple to form an ethane molecule that is further dehydrogenated to ethylene. A similar reaction mechanism was also observed in previous NOCM catalysts\n\n.\nIn the absence of external and internal mass transfer limitation (Supplementary \nand Supplementary Note\n\n), kinetic measurements were performed for NOCM over 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts. A reaction network including three individual reactions is proposed (Supplementary \n), and both forward and reverse reactions of each reaction were considered (Supplementary \n). The detailed kinetic analysis is shown in Supplementary Note\n\n. In the investigated temperature range (700–780 °C), both methane coupling to ethane and ethylene formation from ethane dehydrogenation were first-order reactions (Supplementary \n). The activation energies were 205 and 208 kJ mol\n−1\n(Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n), respectively, which is consistent with previous literature reports\n\n. In particular, the 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalyst showed a stable trend without deactivation for 72 hours (3 days) at 750 °C and 8.6 h\n−1\nGHSV \n), which is in contrast to the 1% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nand 2% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts, which started to deactivate after a few hours (<6 hours) of reaction (Supplementary \n). We further increased the partial pressure of methane to 0.1 atm to test the anti-coke performance of the ATNL catalysts. The catalytic performance, including conversion, selectivity and TOFs remained similar to that of 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts tested under 1% methane. Long-term stability (3 days) of the ATNL catalysts was also achieved at 750 °C (Supplementary \n). It should be noted that catalyst regeneration plays a crucial role in the NOCM reaction, as coke depositions leading to deactivation of catalysts are considered to be inevi\n. We therefore conducted an in-situ regeneration treatment by feeding an O\n\n–H\n\nO mixture at 450 °C for 10 hours after every 72 hours of continuous operation to test the regenerability of the Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts. After two cycles of regeneration, the catalyst continued to activate methane to form C\n\nspecies with high selectivity (>98%) for an additional six days, although methane conversion decreased slightly by ~1% per regeneration (Supplementary \n). At 800 and 850 °C, the long-term stability of Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts was inferior to that of Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ntested at 750 °C, showing performance deactivation at a time on stream (TOS) of 60–65 h (Supplementary \n).\nStructural characterizations of Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts\nAberration-corrected HAADF-STEM and in-situ spectroscopies were executed to study the Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts reduced at the reaction temperature (750 °C). \nand its inset show the Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nsupport viewed along the zone axis, where the hexagonal symmetry is the characteristic structure of Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXenes and suggests that the support was preserved at the reaction temperature. An image at higher magnification \n) and the corresponding EDS elemental mapping (Supplementary \n) confirm that Pt forms rhombic patterns on the surface of MXene supports, consistent with Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts reduced at the activation temperature (450 °C). HAADF-STEM images viewed along the\n\\([11\\bar 20]\\)\nzone axis display atomic-layered Pt intercalated between layers of the MXene support after reduction at 750 °C ,d\n), and that Pt atoms preferentially occupy the hcp sites of the supports, indicating that epitaxial growth of Pt on MXenes and their metal–support interfaces were retained at 750 °C, where Pt is adsorbed and stabilized by Pt–Mo bonds. We also correlated the Pt atoms viewed from the and\n\\([11\\bar 20]\\)\ndirections to solve the structure of the Pt monolayers supported by the MXene, which serves as an experimental observation of the model proposed in \n. The EDS element mappings show that ATNLs of Pt with an average diameter of approximately 4.1 nm are on the surface of the MXene supports and that no agglomerated nanoparticles were formed at the reaction temperature (Supplementary \n). We also characterized the spent 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts using atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM.

The deconvolved molybdenum 3\nd\nspectra of a fresh Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalyst reveal the doublets of both carbidic (Mo–C) and oxidized Mo (Mo–O) species at 228.2/231.4 eV and 231.7/234.6 eV, respectively \n)\n\n. High-resolution XPS spectra in the F 1\ns\nregion also confirmed the presence of surface F species on the fresh Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts \n). The fresh Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalyst was then reduced at 750 °C in a reaction cell connected to the XPS spectrometer before submission to the analysis chamber under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Surface defunctionalization of Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts at the reaction temperature was confirmed by the disappearance of the Mo–O peaks in the Mo 3\nd\nregion and the absence of the F 1\ns\npeak ,f\n). However, oxidized Mo was still present in Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts reduced at 450 °C, indicating that the surface of the MXene support was not fully reduced at the activation temperature (Supplementary \n), which is consistent with previous studies\n\n. The removal of the surface terminations from Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nresults in decreased interlayer spacing of the MXene layers, which was also revealed by HAADF-STEM \n). This observation is consistent with the X-ray diffraction results where the and peaks of Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nsupports shift to higher angles after the reduction, corresponding to decreased\nc\nlattice parameters (Supplementary \n). Moreover, these peaks disappeared for spent Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts after 72 hours of NOCM tests, indicating that the interlayer spacing of the Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nsupport lost the coherence (\nc\ndirection) needed for Bragg diffraction after the defunctionalization, consistent with previous studies\n\n. The reaction temperature (750 °C) also induced structural evolution of the Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts, as demonstrated by the removal of the surface functional groups (-O and -F) and the presence of trace amounts of α-MoC in the MXene supports (Supplementary \n). The contraction of the interlayer distance limits the growth of the Pt ATNLs, facilitating the formation of Pt monolayers with larger size instead of the double nanolayers (Supplementary \n). In addition, the high-temperature reduction defunctionalized the surface terminations, which have been known to anchor Pt precursors\n\n, leading to the growth of Pt ATNLs, from 2.2 nm at 450 °C to 4.1 nm at 750 °C.\nWe further investigated the chemical environment of Pt ATNLs using in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Comparing 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts reduced at 450 °C and 750 °C with metallic Pt foil, Pt L\nIII\nedge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) show that the edge energy increases (Supplementary \n) and that the white-line intensity is higher \n), suggesting that the unoccupied 5\nd\nstates of Pt ATNLs shift to higher energy. According to recent literature, the occupied 5\nd\nstates (valence states) of Pt ATNLs, which are responsible for metal–adsorbate bond energies and catalytic performance, correspondingly shift to lower energy compared to Pt foil\n\n,\n\n. The lower energy of the valence states, due to the interactions between ATNLs and the Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXene support, results in modified absorptive properties of the supported Pt catalysts\n\n. \nshows the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the\nk\n\n-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts plotted together with the Pt foil. The first-shell scattering peaks of Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nare in the same distance region (phase-uncorrected distance,\nR\n= 1.5–3.2 Å) as the Pt–Pt scattering peaks from Pt foil, corresponding to metal–metal bonding. The scattering pattern for Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\n, however, is very different from that of the Pt foil. The peak intensity is greatly reduced at\nR\n= 2–3 Å (phase-uncorrected distances), suggesting strong deconstructive interference of Pt 5\nd\n(Pt–Pt) scattering by Pt 4\nd\n(Pt–Mo) scattering\n\n.\nQuantitative fitting of the EXAFS spectra gives the following average coordination numbers (CNs) and bond distances: 4.9 Pt–Pt bonds at 2.75 Å and 2.3 Pt–Mo bonds at 2.70 Å for Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts reduced at 450 °C; 3.2 Pt–Pt bonds at 2.79 Å and 5.8 Pt–Mo bonds at 2.80 Å for Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts reduced at 750 °C (Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). The results suggest that the Pt ATNLs directly bond with the Mo atoms from the MXene support, which is consistent with HAADF-STEM showing that the Pt nanolayers are in direct contact with the Mo atom layers \n). For 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts there is a decrease in the CN for platinum–platinum interactions (from 4.9 to 3.2), and an increase in the platinum–molybdenum CN (from 2.3 to 5.8), as the reduction temperature increases from 450 °C to 750 °C. The changes in CNs result from the formation of Pt monolayers that dominate Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts reduced at 750 °C, in contrast to the Pt bilayers that were the main structure observed in Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts reduced at 450 °C. Moreover, the average Pt–Pt bond distance (2.79 Å) of 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nreduced at the reaction temperature is slightly longer than that of the catalysts reduced at the activation temperature (2.75 Å), indicating that the strong anchoring of Pt atoms at the C hollow sites alters the metal bonding among the Pt atoms. Our DFT calculations (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n) suggest that the first layer of Pt is strained to match the MXene lattice, leading to an expanded lattice distance compared to the second layer of Pt atoms (Supplementary Note\n\n). For Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts with higher metal loadings (1% and 2%) reduced at 750 °C, the CNs of Pt–Pt bonds increased while the bond distances decreased compared with the ATNLs (Supplementary \n), which is consistent with the results of HAADF-STEM showing the formation of raft-like Pt nanoflakes in the high Pt loading catalysts (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n).\nWe employed temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) to investigate the coke formation of spent 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts tested at various temperatures and to compare them with Pt or bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts\n\n. The TPO profile of the spent catalysts tested at 750 °C after 72 hours shows a major peak near 450 °C \n). With the increase in the reaction temperature, a broad shoulder on the high-temperature side starts to evolve and develops into a distinguishable peak at 510 °C for catalysts tested at 850 °C, corresponding to at least two different types of carbon species. Moreover, our mass spectra results demonstrate that the concentrations of ethane, ethylene and methyl radicals started to decrease when the reaction temperature was higher than 800 °C, while the peaks of benzene (\nm\n/\nz\n= 78) and naphthalene (\nm\n/\nz\n= 128), as coke precursors, increased, especially at 850 °C (Supplementary \n). This observation implies that high operating temperatures (>800 °C) led to heavier aromatics as coke precursor species, which resulted in the deactivation of the catalysts.\n\n, TPO profiles for spent 0.5% Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalyst at GHSV 8.6 h\n−1\nat 850 °C, 800 °C and 750 °C after 72-h tests (\na\n); Pt–Bi/ZSM-5 and Pt/AC (activated carbon) (\nb\n).\nc\n, Energy landscape and DFT optimized configurations for NOCM on a single Pt nanolayer (blue), dual Pt nanolayer (green) and Pt nanoparticle (red).\nd\n, A proposed catalytic circle of NOCM over Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts. TS, transition state.\nFull size image\nThe coke residues of Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts after the TPO tests were dissolved in a mixture of ethanol and acetone and were analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy; in addition to benzene and naphthalene, C\n\n–C\n\npolyaromatic hydrocarbons were the primary coke-representing compounds (Supplementary \n). Coke formation of NOCM is proposed to be via the well-known hydrocarbon pool mechanism, which was originally proposed for MTO (methanol to olefins)\n\nbut has also been applied to methane non-oxidative conversion\n\n. In general, it was hypothesized that the CH\n\n* component, formed by the overdehydrogenation of CH\n\n*, serves as the core species in the hydrocarbon pool (Supplementary \n), which can be converted to heavier hydrocarbons, such as C\n\n–C\n\n, C\n6+\nand eventually coke\n\n. Deep dehydrogenation of CH\n\n* is favoured at high operating temperatures, leading to CH\ny\n* (\ny\n≤ 2), which serve as coke precursors. Note that Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\noperated at 750 °C exhibited the lowest amount of coking compared with Pt nanoparticles supported by activated carbon and Pt–Bi bimetallic nanoparticles on ZSM-5 zeolites \n)\n\n,\n\n, which results in the long-term stability of the catalysts at the optimal reaction temperature (750 °C). To obtain a reliable comparison in activity, we synthesized Pt/AC and Pt–Bi/ZSM-5 catalysts and tested them under the same conditions as for the NOCM reaction (Supplementary \n). Under a methane conversion of 8% at 750 °C, these catalysts suffered from coking and showed lower selectivity to C\n\nproducts compared to the ATNL catalysts, consistent with the observations of the TPO tests.\nDFT studies\nTo gain more insight into the suppressed coke deposition of the ATNL catalysts for the NOCM reaction, the energy profiles of the NOCM reaction and side reactions were investigated using DFT \n). The structures of reaction intermediates and transition states of these reactions are illustrated in \n, with the free energies of different reaction pathways on Pt nanoparticle surfaces and ATNLs calculated. NOCM starts with the activation of the first C–H bond, which leads to dissociative adsorption of methane forming surface alkyl species (CH\n\n*). Our DFT results suggest that the free energy changes of all C–H bond scission steps on the Pt monolayers and double nanolayers are ~1 eV more unfavourable than those on Pt nanoparticles , indicating weakened surface adsorption of the ATNLs due to the altered electronic structure suggested by XANES. Such a weakening leads to the preferential desorption of surface alkyl species to form methyl radicals instead of scission of the remaining C–H bonds towards deep dehydrogenation, which is believed to generate coke precursors.\nOn ATNLs at 750 °C, the scission of a secondary C–H, that is, from CH\n\n* to CH\n\n*, is endergonic, while CH\n\n* desorption is exergonic. Furthermore, compared with the energy barrier associated with conversion of CH\n\n* to CH\n\n* (TS2), CH\n\n* desorption to methyl radicals is even more preferred, with an energy difference of approximately 0.7–0.9 eV. This is primarily due to the relatively weak adsorption of CH\n\n* over ATNLs. In contrast, the deep dehydrogenation step is more favoured over the surface of Pt nanoparticles, by approximately 0.2–0.3 eV in free energy, indicating that the formation of a methyl radical is less favourable than further dehydrogenation. Compared to the methyl desorption step, C–H bond scissions of overdehydrogenated reaction intermediates, for example, CH\n\n* and CH*, are both exergonic and much more favourable. These findings rationalize our experimental observations that Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts readily activate C–H bonds in methane to form CH\n\n*, which is prone to desorption from the surface of ATNLs instead of overdehydrogenation, leading to higher selectivity for C\n\nproducts while resisting coke formation.\nConclusions\nIn summary, our experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the epitaxial growth of atomically thin Pt nanolayers on the surface of Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXene. We found that ATNLs of Pt were anchored on the MXene through strong Pt–Mo bonding at the metal–support interfaces, which leads to atomic dispersion and altered absorptive properties of the Pt active sites that favour methane coupling over coking formation. Consequently, Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts delivered stable methane conversion (7%) to C\n\nproducts with >98% selectivity and TOFs of 0.2–0.6 s\n−1\n. The regeneration of MXene-based catalysts is still in its infancy, and requires attention and systematic study to achieve the rational design of MXene-based materials for heterogeneous catalysis. Atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM images (Supplementary \n) of regenerated catalysts show that Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXene supports were sintered with the loss of their original ordering of transition metals (Mo-Ti-Mo), and that Pt monolayers substituted the Mo layers to form an atomic layer sequence of Pt-Ti-Mo. This substitution results from the decay of the structural integrity of Pt/Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\ncatalysts after oxidative regeneration, as shown by the X-ray diffraction pattern (Supplementary \n). Although Pt nanolayers were still observed in the regenerated catalysts, their chemical environment and size changed, leading to a decreased (~1%) conversion after each regeneration step. Since commercial processes have been developed for converting C\n\n(ethane/ethylene) to liquid hydrocarbon (C\n8+\n) (Supplementary \n)\n\n, the NOCM is the last part remaining to be solved, which merits future research attention for visible industrial methane-to-liquid technology.\n\nSynthesis of Mo\n\nTiAlC\n\nand Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXene\nA spark plasma sintering was employed to synthesize Mo\n\nTiAlC\n\n(MAX phase). In detail, commercial powders of molybdenum (Sigma Aldrich, 99%), titanium (325 mesh, 99%, Alfa Aesar), aluminium (325 mesh, 99.5%, Alfa Aesar) and graphite (7–11 μm, 99%, Alfa Aesar) were mixed with a molar ratio of Al/C/Ti/Mo of 1.1:1.9:1:2. The mixture was loaded into a graphite die coated with boron nitride. Next, the graphite die was transferred into a spark plasma sintering system (Fuji-211lx) where it was sintered at 1,450 °C for 60 minutes and subjected to a uniaxial pressure of 30 MPa. The synthesized Mo\n\nTiAlC\n\ndisk was then hand-pulverized in a synthetic sapphire mortar to pass through a 400-mesh screen. The Mo\n\nTiAlC\n\npowder was etched with HF (48%) at 55 °C for 72 hours. The as-obtained Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXene was then washed with deionized water until the pH was approximately 5, followed by centrifugation at 8,900 r.p.m. The Mo\n\nTiC\n\nT\nx\nMXene powders were collected and then dried under vacuum at ambient temperature.\n\nSynthesis of Pt/Mo"

This suspension was then mixed with 0.4 g of a dispersed activated Ketjen 600 carbon black support (washed in HCl for purification and HNO\n\nfor oxygen doping), stirred for 48 h and then dried in the air at 95 °C for 24 h.

Temperature-programmed desorption experiments (Supplementary\n\nand Supplementary Note\n\n) show that FeNC, but not NiNC, have a peak above 300 K. This result suggests strong binding sites, such as those from SVs to be present on FeNC to a greater extent than on NiNC (\n). Note that doped SV sites, or other binding sites of similar binding strength that we have not considered, are not active sites for CO\n\nR, as they would be poisoned by CO.\nMNCs have a higher activity because they stabilize larger dipoles\nWe now show that MNCs deviate from TM scaling because they stabilize large dipole moments on CO\n\n*. \nshows charge density difference isosurfaces for CO\n\n* on NiN\n\nC, which shows a perturbation of the electron density near the surface on adsorption. This change in electron density is captured by the dipole moment, given by\n\\(\\mu = {\\int} {\\rho {\\rm{d}}z}\\)\n, where\n\\(\\rho\\)\nis the charge density and\nz\nis the axis of integration, and is shown in \nfor and TM surfaces, as well as Fe- and Ni-doped MNC catalysts in both SVs and DVs of various N concentrations. The figure shows that the dipole moments for CO\n\n* are larger than those for other adsorbates, such as CO* and COOH*. Furthermore, the CO\n\n* dipoles are significantly higher on MNCs than on TMs. MNCs therefore have CO\n\n* adsorption energies that are stabilized more at reducing potentials, at which the surface is generally negatively charged. This electrostatic stabilization caused by the dipole-field interaction gives rise to the offset of MNCs from the TM scaling line shown in \n.\n\n, Vacuum dipole moments for and TM surfaces (blue) and Fe and Ni MNCs (red). The MNCs (first index indicates the type of vacancy, 1 for single and 2 for double; second index indicates the number of substituting N atoms) have larger dipole moments as compared with those of the TMs.\nb\n, Charge density difference plot for CO\n\nadsorbed on NiN\n\nC.\nc\n, Density of states projected onto the\ns\nand\np\nstates of CO\n\n* (green) and the\nd\nstates of TMs (purple) show that the adsorbate states are much narrower on MNCs than they are on TMs.\nFull size image\nWe rationalize the differences in dipole moments with the PDOS on the\ns\nand\np\nstates of CO\n\n*. The strength of the adsorbate–surface interaction is determined by both the position and shape of the\nd\nstates, and is reflected in the width of the\ns\nand/or\np\nadsorbate states\n\n. As shown in \nfor a selected set of surfaces (in green), the width of the\ns\nand\np\nstates increases in the order FeN\n\n, NiN\n\n, Ag, Au, Pd and Pt.\nIn FeN\n\nand NiN\n\ncatalysts, the sharp\ns\nand/or\np\nstates of CO\n\n* mean they resemble those of their molecular counterpart, which indicates a weak interaction (poor hybridization) with the surface. A poor overlap between the\ns\nand or\np\nstates close to the Fermi level (±1 eV in either direction) of CO\n\nand the\nd\nstates of the surface means that CO\n\n* retains a greater charge polarization between its two poles, that is a larger dipole (see Supplementary Note\n\nfor an explanation of this effect through the Newns–Muscat model). The same effect is present to a lesser extent on the weakly binding metals, Ag and Au, which, in comparison with the strongly binding ones, have slightly narrower\nd\nstates and correspondingly slightly larger dipoles. In the strongly binding Pt and Pd catalysts, the broadened states indicate a large interaction\n\n, and a lower charge polarization results from the mixing of adsorbate states with those of the surface and a lower resultant surface dipole. Overall, the trends in the width of the\ns\nand/or\np\nPDOS of CO\n\n* are consistent with the larger dipole moments of MNC catalysts.\nTM alloys, in contrast to MNC catalysts, generally have wide\nd\nstates, as with pure TMs\n\n. In view of the results, improvements in activity through alloying can be attributed not to the stabilization of larger dipoles, but to the tuning of the CO\n\n* binding strengths through the degree of hybridization with the surface.\nThe activity volcano of \nand electronic structure arguments of \ngive two simple design principles. As shown in the TOF of \n, the ideal CO\n\nR catalyst has moderate\n\\({{{\\mathrm{{\\Delta}}}}}G_{{{{\\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\\)\nand Δ\nG\nCOOH\nof 0.25–0.5 eV and Δ\nG\nCO\n> 0 eV (to prevent CO* poisoning). It must, additionally, be able to stabilize a large dipole moment of CO\n\n*, such that CO\n\nadsorption does not require a significant overpotential (and thereby deviate from the scaling of TMs in the direction of a higher activity, shown in \n). These larger dipole moments are stabilized for MNC catalyst materials through their narrow\nd\nstates. We suggest that other materials that have similar discrete and narrow\nd\nstates, such as supported single atoms\n\n,\n\n, molecules and clusters\n\n,\n\n, as well as two-dimensional materials and ionic compounds\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, could also be active CO\n\nR catalysts, provided that hydrogen evolution is not competitive or suppressed through a decrease in water activity\n\n. This principle could also be relevant for other processes in which dipole -field interactions are decisive, such as in C\n\nproduct formation\n\n,\n\n.\nConclusions\nIn summary, we present a unified picture of CO\n\nR to CO on both TM and MNC catalysts that resolves the existing controversies on the identity and nature of the rate-limiting step. Considering the widths of the projected densities of states of an adsorbing CO\n\n, we showed that, as for TMs, the electron transfer to CO\n\nis not limiting in MNCs, and that CO\n\nadsorption is driven by adsorbate dipole-field interactions. With a combination of field-dependent DFT and pH-dependent activity measurements, we showed that CO\n\n* adsorption is limiting on TMs over relevant potentials, whereas either CO\n\n* adsorption or COOH* formation is rate limiting on MNCs. We present a unified kinetic activity volcano, based on critical COOH* and CO\n\n* binding as the descriptors, that accounts for the decisive adsorbate dipole-field interactions. The volcano shows that ideal catalysts should have both a moderate binding strength of COOH* and CO\n\n*, as well as large adsorbate dipoles on CO\n\n*. We furthermore showed that MNCs deviate favourably from TM scaling through the stabilization of large CO\n\n* dipoles, due to the localized narrow\nd\nstates of these materials.\nThese results suggest that MNCs or other materials with similarly narrow\nd\nstates, such as supported single atoms, molecules and clusters, as well as two-dimensional materials and ionic compounds, can be optimized for large dipoles and correspondingly higher catalytic activity beyond TM scaling. This principle can be relevant for other processes in which adsorbate–field interactions are decisive. The presented kinetic activity volcano and catalyst design rules should be used as the basis for computation-guided catalyst development of CO\n\nR to CO catalysts.\n\nMethods\nComputational methods\nDFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab Initio Software Package (VASP)\n\n. Core electrons were described using projector augmented wave potentials\n\n. Valence electrons were described with plane waves with a kinetic energy up to 500 eV. Gaussian smearing with a width of 0.1 eV was used. In the case of density of states plots, smearing was reduced to 0.05 eV. For relaxations, we applied the RPBE\n\nfunctional. Hybrid calculations with the HSE06\n\n,\n\nwere performed for the density of states calculations in \n. In the case of FeNC calculations, a Hubbard-U\n\nparameter of\nU\n= 2 eV was added to the\nd\norbitals of iron, in line with previous benchmark calculations\n\n.\nTMs were modelled using a 3 × 3 × 3 slab, with the bottom two layers fixed. MNC systems were modelled using a 3 × 3 graphene layer. All the structures were prepared using the Atomic Simulation Environment\n\n. The lattice for all the TM and MNC catalysts were relaxed using a 12 × 12 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack\n\nk\n-point mesh. All the supercells were treated with a 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack\nk\n-point mesh. All the geometries were optimized until the forces were lower than 0.025 eV Å\n−1\n. TS geometries and energies were obtained using the climbing image nudged elastic band\n\nimplemented within VASP. All the density of states plots used twice the\nk\n-point sampling used in the relaxation and/or TS calculations. DFT energies were converted into free energies at 298.15 K using vibrations obtained from VASP calculations using IBRION = 5. The ASE\n\nThermochemistry class was used to determine the Helmholtz free energy from harmonic thermochemistry and the Gibbs free energy from ideal gas thermochemistry.\nImplicit solvation and continuum charge were added using VASPsol\n\n. A Debye screening length of 3 Å was chosen, as it corresponds to a bulk ion concentration of 1 M. The non-electrostatic parameter, TAU, was set to zero for purposes of convergence\n\n. Continuum charge was varied in increments of 0.25 e.\nThe computational hydrogen electrode\n\nwas used to determine the reaction energetics as a function of the potential with a proton–electron pair was in the reactant. The chemical potential of the proton can be related to that of H\n\nat 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode:\n$$\\mu _{{{{\\mathrm{H}}}}^ + } + \\mu _{{{{\\mathrm{e}}}}^ - } = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu _{{{{\\mathrm{H}}}}_2\\left( {{{\\mathrm{g}}}} \\right)}$$\n\nThe incorporation of the dipole-field interactions is described in detail in Supplementary Note\n\n.\nMicrokinetic modelling was performed using CatMAP\n\n. The rate of a given elementary step was\n\\({{{\\mathrm{rate}}}} = k_ + {{{\\mathrm{{\\Pi}}}}}\\theta _i{{{\\mathrm{{\\Pi}}}}}p_j - k_ - {{{\\mathrm{{\\Pi}}}}}\\theta _i{{{\\mathrm{{\\Pi}}}}}p_j\\)\n, where ‘+’ indicates the forward reaction and ‘−’ the reverse reaction. The rate constants are\n\\(k_ + = \\exp \\left( { - \\frac{{G_{a, + }}}{{k_{\\rm{B}}T}}} \\right)\\)\nand\n\\(k_ - = \\exp \\left( { - \\frac{{G_{a, - }}}{{k_{\\rm{B}}T}}} \\right)\\)\n, where\nG\na\n,+\nand\nG\na\n,–\nare the free energy barriers. In the absence of electrochemical barriers, the free energy is used, which is given as Δ\nG\n= Δ\nG\n° +\nneU\n+ Δ\nG\nfield\n, where Δ\nG\n° is the free energy for the reaction at the potential of zero charge,\nn\nis the number of proton–electron pairs transferred and Δ\nG\nfield\nis the dipole-field contribution.\nA multiprecision Newton root-finding algorithm was used to determine the steady-state rates and coverages. A decimal precision of 100 along with a convergence tolerance value of 10\n−25\nwere used.\nSynthesis\nThe polyaniline-derived NiNC catalyst is identical to that reported in our previous studies\n\n,\n\n. Aniline (3 ml), NiCl\n\n·6H\n\nO (5 g) and ammonium persulfate (5 g) were added to 0.5 l of 1 M HCl and stirred for 1 h. This suspension was then mixed with 0.4 g of a dispersed activated Ketjen 600 carbon black support (washed in HCl for purification and HNO\n\nfor oxygen doping), stirred for 48 h and then dried in the air at 95 °C for 24 h. The residual solid-state mixture was ball milled with Zr\n\nO\n\nballs for 20 min. We conducted the pyrolysis protocol in a furnace at 900 °C (ramp of 30 °C min\n–1\n) for 1 h under N\n\nconditions, followed by acid washing steps (2 M H\n\nSO\n\nat 90 °C overnight) to remove the excessive Ni particles. We performed heat treatment four times and acid washing three times and the catalyst was obtained after the fourth pyrolysis.\n\nSynthesis of CoPc/CNT\nCoPc/CNT was synthesized following an analogous protocol reported in the literature\n\n. CoPc (1 mg) was mixed with 30 mg of a multiwall CNT in 30 ml dimethylformamide solution and stirred for 24 h. The suspension became transparent. The final suspension was washed using EtOH and H\n\nO within a centrifuge to remove the dimethylformamide, and after that was freeze-dried to give the final catalyst.\n\nElectrode preparation\nCarbon paper (1 cm × 2.5 cm, Freudenberg C2H23) was sonicated in ethanol and deionized water for 15 min and dried as the electrode substrate.

Here we considered a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism involving the two-step dehydrogenation of C\n\nexperimental orders only when the CO\n\nactivation to form CO and O was regarded as the RDS (step 6 in \n). In addition, we conducted microkinetic modelling based on the transition state theory and steady-state approximation to estimate the forward and reverse reaction rates for each step (Supplementary Note\n\nexperimental trends (Supplementary \n). This result strongly supports the validity of our kinetic model. Although the simulated values did not match exactly with the experimental ones, this may be due to insufficient accuracy in estimating the number of active sites. As suggested by the EXAFS study, small cobalt clusters are also present on CeO\n\n, which complicates the interpretation of CO adsorption and the resulting metal dispersion (in this context, a more nuanced calibration of the number of active sites may improve the degree of agreement). Thus, the kinetic analysis revealed that alloying with cobalt kinetically promoted CO\n\nactivation, which is the RDS of the CO\n\n-ODP.

These values were close to those of the and planes of intermetallic Pt\n\nIn\n\n,k\n)\n\n. Because the atomic ratio of (Pt + Co):In is close to 2:3 (2:2.7), the nanoparticles probably have a (Pt\n1−\nx\nCo\nx\n)\n\nIn\n\npseudo-binary alloy structure, where some platinum atoms in Pt\n\nIn\n\nare substituted by cobalt \n). We also performed an X-ray diffraction analysis of Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\n, from which a diffraction pattern similar to that of Pt\n\nIn\n\nwas obtained, although the diffraction angles were slightly lower than those of pure Pt\n\nIn\n\n(Supplementary \n). This indicates lattice expansion of Pt\n\nIn\n\ncaused by cobalt doping and supports the formation of the (Pt\n1−\nx\nCo\nx\n)\n\nIn\n\npseudo-binary alloy structure. To obtain further structural information, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was subsequently performed. The Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nsample was reduced in situ by a flow of hydrogen at 550 °C for 0.5 h. The Pt L\nIII\n-edge, Co K-edge and In K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) of the pretreated Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nwere similar to those of the corresponding foils, indicating that these metals are reduced mostly to a zero-valent state (Supplementary \n). A small contribution of In\n\nO\n\nwas observed in the In K-edge XANES (Supplementary \n) and extended XAFS (EXAFS) spectra (Supplementary \n; the Fourier transform of the EXAFS is shown in Supplementary \n). This suggests that the residual indium species, which did not participate in the alloy formation, is present as an oxide on CeO\n\n. EXAFS curve-fitting (Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n) suggested the presence of Pt–In (In–Pt) and Co–In (In–Co) scatterings. This result agrees with the formation of the (Pt\n1−\nx\nCo\nx\n)\n\nIn\n\npseudo-binary alloy structure and supports that cobalt was doped at the platinum sites of Pt\n\nIn\n\n. For Co K-edge fitting, Co–Co scattering with an interatomic distance (\nR\n= 2.44 Å) close to that of cobalt foil (\nR\n= 2.49 Å) was also suggested. This indicates the presence of monometallic cobalt nanoparticles on CeO\n\nand is consistent with the result of the HAADF-STEM-EDX analysis. In–O scattering was also derived for In K-edge fitting, indicating the presence of In\n\nO\n\nas observed for the XANES. Thus, the XAFS analysis demonstrated the formation of (Pt\n1−\nx\nCo\nx\n)\n\nIn\n\npseudo-binary alloy nanoparticles on CeO\n\n. The residual cobalt and indium species, which did not participate in alloy formation, remained as monometallic cobalt and In\n\nO\n\nnanoparticles. In addition, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the catalysts. Pt/CeO\n\nand Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nshowed similar Pt 4\nf\n7/2\nemissions at 71.6 and 71.4 eV, respectively, which are assigned to metallic platinum (Supplementary \n)\n\n. The small negative shift indicates that platinum was slightly electron-enriched upon alloying with indium and cobalt. The indium 3\nd\nXPS spectrum showed that the surface indium species were mainly metallic. A small amount of indium was oxidized (Supplementary \n: In\n\n, 443.5 eV; In\n3+\n, 444.5 eV)\n\n, which can be attributed to the ternary alloy phase and residual In\n\nO\n\n, respectively, as suggested by the XAFS study.\nCatalytic reactions\nThe Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\ncatalyst was then tested for the CO\n\n-ODP at 550 °C. Some platinum-based binary alloy catalysts (Pt–M/CeO\n\n; M = Co, In and Sn), in which the platinum dispersion is similar to that in Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\n(Supplementary \n), and monometallic Pt/CeO\n\nwere examined to understand the individual effect of each second metal. For all the catalysts, the products were CO, C\n\nH\n\n, C\n\nH\n\n, C\n\nH\n\n, CH\n\n, H\n\nO and H\n\n.

Although the Pt/CeO\n\nand Pt–M/CeO\n\ncatalysts showed a high initial C\n\nH\n\nconversion (52–68%), rapid deactivation occurred within 5–10 h.

Predictably, catalysts containing a typical metal (indium or tin) exhibited a high C\n\nH\n\nselectivity (82–95%), attributed to the ensemble effect by alloying, where the highest selectivity was obtained with Pt–Co–In (95%). Platinum and Pt–Co showed very low C\n\nH\n\nselectivities (35% and 27%, respectively) at the beginning of the reaction due to undesired side reactions generating C1 and C2 hydrocarbons (hydrogenolysis; Supplementary \n). Platinum and Pt–Co catalysts also showed a significant deviation of material balance from unity (for example, for platinum, C\nx\nH\ny\n: 0.71 and CO\nx\n: 1.31; Supplementary \n), which suggests that dry reforming of C\n\nH\n\nto CO also occurred to a large extent. Conversely, the carbon balances in C\nx\nH\ny\nand CO\nx\nwere close to unity for Pt–Co–In, indicating a minor contribution of dry reforming on the ternary alloy catalyst (Supplementary \n). The net C\n\nH\n\nselectivity and yield, which consider CO from C\n\nH\n\nas a by-product, were still high (86–97%, Supplementary \nand 47–44%, Supplementary \n, respectively). The hydrogen yield for Pt–Co–In was less than 5% (Supplementary \n), indicating that a large part of the hydrogen derived from C\n\nH\n\nwas consumed by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This also suggests that the contribution of DDP versus CO\n\n-ODP to the overall C\n\nH\n\nproduction, which is reflected roughly by the H\n\nyield/C\n\nH\n\nyield ratio\n\n, was very low (\n∼\n10%). Given that hydrogen can also be formed by dry reforming to a small extent, the actual contribution of DDP should be much lower than 10%. For the CO\n\nconversion stability \n), a similar trend to that of C\n\nH\n\nwas observed: only Pt–Co–In showed good stability, while other mono- and bimetallic catalysts were deactivated within 10 h. Interestingly, the initial conversion of CO\n\ndiffered depending on the metal component in the following order: Pt–Co > Pt, Pt–Sn, Pt–Co–In\n≫\nPt–In. This result implies that cobalt promotes CO\n\ncapture and activation as expected, and that alloying with indium alone significantly reduces this ability. Therefore, alloying platinum with both cobalt and indium may neutralize the negative effect of indium, thereby promoting the CO\n\nconversion, comparable to the level achieved with monometallic platinum. Next, monometallic Co/CeO\n\nand In/CeO\n\ncatalysts were also tested for the CO\n\n-ODP as control experiments (Supplementary \n). Although Co/CeO\n\nwas active for both C\n\nH\n\nand CO\n\nconversions at the beginning of the reaction, it rapidly deactivated within only 0.5 h (C\n\nH\n\n: 48% → 7%; CO\n\n: 54% → 22%). After the deactivation, Co/CeO\n\nretained the low CO\n\nconversion (22%), which is probably due to the contribution of cobalt oxide species to CO\n\nreduction\n\n,\n\n(Co/SiO\n\nwas not fully reduced by reduction at 600 °C; see H\n\n-TPR, Supplementary \n). In/CeO\n\nwas almost inactive for both reactions. Therefore, the residual metallic cobalt and indium oxide species in Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nare unlikely to contribute to the high catalytic performance. We performed further control experiments using physical mixtures of the binary and monometallic catalysts (Pt–Co/CeO\n\n+ In/CeO\n\n, Pt–In/CeO\n\n+ Co/CeO\n\nand Co–In/CeO\n\n+ Pt/CeO\n\n) and Pt–In+Co/CeO\n\n, where the cobalt cation was loaded on Pt–In/CeO\n\n. Their catalytic activities and stabilities were much lower than those of Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\n(Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n), demonstrating that the ternary alloy structure with cobalt doped into Pt–In alloy is essential for a high catalytic performance. A temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) (Supplementary \n) and Raman analysis (Supplementary \n) of the spent catalysts after the 20 h catalytic run showed almost no coke accumulation on Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\n, unlike the case with other deactivated catalysts. The average coke selectivity was calculated at 10 h by dividing the moles of accumulated coke by the total moles of converted C\n\nH\n\nand the carbon number of C\n\nH\n\n, which was lower than 0.1% (Supplementary \n).\nThe obtained high catalytic performance of Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nwas compared with a number of reported systems for the CO\n\n-ODP, considering the activity, selectivity, stability and CO\n\nutilization efficiency (see Supplementary Tables\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary \nfor details with references). For a better comparison, the catalytic performance of Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nat 600 °C (Supplementary \n) was also included. For alkane dehydrogenation, high catalytic activity is often achieved at the expense of selectivity and stability via the triggering of undesired side reactions\n\n. Therefore, plotting stability or selectivity versus activity can be a good indication of the overall performance. More specifically, the mean catalyst life as a reciprocal deactivation constant (\n\\(\\tau=k_{\\mathrm{d}}^{-1}\\)\n) versus specific activity\n\\(\\left( {{{{\\mathrm{ml}}}}_{{{{\\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\\mathrm{H}}}}_6}\\, {{{\\mathrm{min}}}}^{ - 1}\\, {\\mathrm{g}}_{{{{\\mathrm{cat}}}}}^{ - 1}} \\right)\\)\nand the conversion–selectivity relationship were considered ,e\n, respectively). The specific activity of our catalyst was approximately five times higher than typical values previously reported. This high catalytic activity is attributed to the use of platinum as the main active metal for the selective CO\n\n-ODP. Moreover, the mean catalytic life of our catalyst at 550 °C was also higher than those previously reported. For the selectivity–conversion plot, we showed two selectivity descriptions for better comparison with reported systems, that is, we considered by-products other than C\nx\nH\ny\nsuch as CO (net C\n\nH\n\nselectivity) or not (C\n\nH\n\nselectivity in C\nx\nH\ny\n). Our catalyst exhibited very high C\n\nH\n\nselectivity (86% and 95% for open and filled circles, respectively) at a high C\n\nH\n\nconversion region (>50%) \n), indicating its significant ability to suppress undesired side reactions. \nshows the plot of the CO\n\nconversion versus the C\n\nH\n\nyield, which reflects the CO\n\nutilization efficiency. A high CO\n\nconversion with C\n\nH\n\nproduction in 1:1 stoichiometry (upper right in \n) is preferred for a high CO\n\nutilization efficiency (see equation (\n\n) for the definition of CO\n\nutilization efficiency). In this context, our catalyst exhibited high CO\n\nconversion and C\n\nH\n\nyield with near 1:1 stoichiometry, which compares favourably with previous systems, and achieved CO\n\nutilization efficiencies of 53% at 550 °C and 70% at 600 °C (Supplementary \n). We also examined the reusability and long-term stability of Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nby applying a regeneration process. The regeneration of deactivated catalysts typically uses oxygen or air to combust deposited carbon. In this study, CO\n\nwas used instead as a soft oxidant for the Boudouard reaction because of its relatively easy handling. To switch the catalytic run to the regeneration process, the supply of C\n\nH\n\nwas cut off to feed CO\n\n/He for 5 h, followed by H\n\nreduction for 0.5 h at the same temperature. CO\n\nconversion was fully recovered by this process, and no negative effect on the C\n\nH\n\nconversion was observed ,h\n; see Supplementary \nfor C\n\nH\n\nselectivity). Although a slight decrease in C\n\nH\n\nconversion was observed, the conversion reached a steady state after 70 h and retained 33% conversion at 96 h. Thus, the Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\ncatalyst displayed multiple properties of outstanding catalytic activity, excellent C\n\nH\n\nselectivity, high CO\n\nutilization efficiency, long-term stability and reusability. In \n, C\n\nH\n\nconversion was not fully recovered under the regeneration condition, indicating that coke on the active site for C\n\nH\n\ndehydrogenation is harder to remove than that for CO\n\nactivation. We also performed a control experiment with a DDP-CO\n\ncycle test on Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\n, where the gas feed was switched from C\n\nH\n\n/He (2 h) to CO\n\n/He (0.5 h). Although the C\n\nH\n\nconversion decreased to near zero within 2 h in the absence of CO\n\n, it was recovered by the CO\n\ntreatment (Supplementary \n). Thus, the Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\ncatalyst is highly capable of coke combustion by CO\n\n, which enables continuous coke removal and long-term stability in CO\n\n-ODP.\nMechanistic study\nWe also performed a mechanistic study to understand in depth the functions of cobalt, indium and CeO\n\nin the catalysis. First, a kinetic analysis was conducted to understand the rate-determining step (RDS) of the CO\n\n-ODP on Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\n. The following reaction rate equation was considered for the CO\n\n-ODP:\n\\(r_x = kP_{{{{\\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^\\alpha P_{{{{\\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^\\beta\\)\n, where\nr\nx\nis the consumption rate of\nx\n(\nx\n= C\n\nH\n\nor CO\n\n), and\n\\(P_{{{{\\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\\)\nand\n\\(P_{{{{\\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\\)\nare the pressures of C\n\nH\n\nand CO\n\n, respectively. The experimental reaction orders were positive and could be higher than unity for\n\\(P_{{{{\\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\\)\n, while they were negative for\n\\(P_{{{{\\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\\)\n\n; see Supplementary \nfor details). Here we considered a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism involving the two-step dehydrogenation of C\n\nH\n\nto C\n\nH\n\n, CO\n\nreduction to CO, and oxidation of the eliminated hydrogen to form water \n). We solved the rate equation of each step by applying the quasi-stationary approximation and site conservation conditions (see Supplementary Note\n\nfor details). The ranges of predicted reaction orders were fully consistent with the experimental orders only when the CO\n\nactivation to form CO and O was regarded as the RDS (step 6 in \n). In addition, we conducted microkinetic modelling based on the transition state theory and steady-state approximation to estimate the forward and reverse reaction rates for each step (Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary \n). For this modelling, some parameters calculated using density functional theory (DFT), such as activation energy (to be described later) and vibrational frequency, were used. As shown in \n(calculated reaction rate), step 6 showed the lowest rate. These results showed that the RDS of CO\n\n-ODP on Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nwas the CO\n\nactivation. Subsequently, the apparent activation energy (\nE\nA\n*) was estimated for Pt–In/CeO\n\nand Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nby Arrhenius-type plots. The\nE\nA\nof CO\n\nactivation was significantly reduced (from 168.8 to 138.3 kJ mol\n−1\n) by the incorporation of cobalt into Pt–In \nand Supplementary \n), which is consistent with the experimental trend of the CO\n\nconversion and turnover frequency (TOF), as shown in \nand Supplementary \n, respectively. We also simulated the dependences of the reaction rate on\n\\(P_{{{{\\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\\)\nand temperature using the kinetic modelling, both of which were found to be consistent with the experimental trends (Supplementary \n). This result strongly supports the validity of our kinetic model. Although the simulated values did not match exactly with the experimental ones, this may be due to insufficient accuracy in estimating the number of active sites. As suggested by the EXAFS study, small cobalt clusters are also present on CeO\n\n, which complicates the interpretation of CO adsorption and the resulting metal dispersion (in this context, a more nuanced calibration of the number of active sites may improve the degree of agreement). Thus, the kinetic analysis revealed that alloying with cobalt kinetically promoted CO\n\nactivation, which is the RDS of the CO\n\n-ODP. Compared with previously reported systems, Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nshowed comparable\nE\nA\n* for C\n\nH\n\ndehydrogenation (WO\nx\n–VO\nx\n/SiO\n\n, 127–145 kJ mol\n−1\n; Fe\n\nNi/CeO\n\n, 115 kJ mol\n−1\n) and for CO\n\nactivation (Fe\n\nNi/CeO\n\n, 135 kJ mol\n−1\n).\n Summary of the kinetic study of the CO2-ODP\nFull size table\nWe subsequently examined a series of Pt–Co–In catalysts using various supports, such as Al\n\nO\n\n, TiO\n\nand ZrO\n\n, to clarify the role of the CeO\n\nsupport. Although these catalysts showed moderate initial conversions of C\n\nH\n\nand CO\n\n, rapid deactivation occurred within 1–2 h ,b\n). This result strongly indicates that the role of CeO\n\nis to significantly enhance the catalyst stability; this is probably attributed to its coke combustion ability, as mentioned above. To confirm this ability, temperature-programmed surface reactions (TPSRs) were conducted using the coked catalysts under helium and CO\n\nflows. The coked Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nevolved CO from 500 °C even in the absence of CO\n\n(He-TPSR, \n), whereas the coked Pt–Co–In/Al\n\nO\n\nshowed almost no CO evolution up to 600 °C.\n\n, C\n\nH\n\n(\na\n) and CO\n\n(\nb\n) conversions in the CO\n\n-ODP on the Pt–Co–In catalysts using various supports.\nc\n, He-TPSR on the coked Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\n(used in the DDP for 2 h) and Pt–Co–In /Al\n\nO\n\n(used in the CO\n\n-ODP for 2 h) catalysts.\nd\n, CO\n\n-TPSR on the coked Pt/CeO\n\n, Pt–In/CeO\n\n(used in the CO\n\n-ODP for 2 h) and Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\n(used in the DDP for 2 h) catalysts. CO evolution was quantified by the mass intensity of\nm\n/\nz\n= 28.\ne\n, CO\n\n-titration (TPO) experiment for the oxygen vacancy of CeO\n\nusing Pt/CeO\n\n.\nFull size image\nThe CO evolution from the coked Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nbetween 500 and 600 °C can be attributed to the coke combustion by the lattice oxygen of CeO\n\n. Thus, CeO\n\ncan remove coke at the reaction temperature of the CO\n\n-ODP (550 °C), whereas Al\n\nO\n\ncannot, which agrees with the stability trend in the CO\n\n-ODP. Interestingly, intense CO evolution was observed from 600 °C for both catalysts, which might be due to the coke combustion by the oxygen atoms of the surface hydroxyl groups. When the TPSR experiment for the coked Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nwas performed in the presence of CO\n\n(CO\n\n-TPSR, \n), a very large amount of CO (see the scale bars) was evolved starting at 500 °C, and the coke was completely combusted at 700 °C. This is clearly due to the continuous oxygen supply from CO\n\n. The corresponding TPSR for the coked Pt/CeO\n\nand Pt–In/CeO\n\nshowed similar CO evolutions at high temperatures (peak temperature: Pt–Co–In < Pt < Pt–In), although a low evolution was observed at 550 °C. These results are roughly consistent with the deactivation trend (Pt–Co–In < Pt, Pt–In) \n) and the CO\n\n-reducing ability (Pt–Co–In, Pt > Pt–In) \n), which reflects the coke combustion abilities of these catalysts. Based on these results, we concluded that the coke combustion ability depended on the CO\n\n-reducing ability of the metal nanoparticles and on the oxygen-releasing ability of CeO\n\n. The concert of the ternary alloy and the specific character of the CeO\n\nsupport enabled the continuous self-regeneration function and the remarkably high coke resistance. Furthermore, we verified the filling of oxygen vacancy after the lattice oxygen consumption of CeO\n\nusing a CO\n\n-titration (TPO) technique and Pt/CeO\n\n. As shown in \n, oxygen vacancies of CeO\n\nwere obtained by H\n\n-TPR, followed by cooling and subsequent CO\n\n-TPO. CO evolution was completed by 550 °C, indicating that CO\n\nwas divided into CO and O. The oxygen atoms were left on the catalyst. H\n\n-TPR was repeated after CO\n\n-TPO and cooling, where the reduction peak of CeO\n\nappeared again \n). These results strongly support that the oxygen atoms derived from CO\n\nrefill the oxygen vacancies of CeO\n\n.\nFinally, we conducted DFT calculations to understand the role of the Pt–Co–In ternary alloy in the enhanced catalysis. As a model of the Pt–Co–In alloy surface, the stable surface of intermetallic Pt\n\nIn\n\nwas considered and one of the surface platinum atoms was replaced with cobalt, hereafter denoted as Pt\n\nIn\n\n–Co. Unmodified Pt\n\nIn\n\n and monometallic Pt surfaces were also considered for comparison. CO\n\nreduction to CO, C\n\nH\n\ndehydrogenation to C\n\nH\n\n, H\n\nO formation, and H\n\nrecombination were considered on these surfaces (see Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nfor detailed structures and Supplementary \nfor Gibbs free energy changes). \nshows the energy diagram of CO\n\nreduction, where CO\n\nwas first physisorbed, then chemisorbed with a bent\nsp\n\n-like conformation, followed by C–O bond scission to form CO and O, and lastly, CO desorption. The chemisorption was endothermic and required moderate energy barriers of 55–57 kJ mol\n−1\n. For Pt\n\nIn\n\nand Pt\n\nIn\n\n–Co, the CO on a top site of Pt/Co and O at an In–In bridge site were more stable than those on Pt, probably due to the oxophilicity of indium. CO was considerably more stable on cobalt than on platinum; therefore, the direct desorption of CO from the cobalt site required a high amount of energy (182.3 kJ mol\n−1\n). Relatively low-energy desorption is still allowed when CO migrates to the neighbouring platinum site. However, the microkinetic modelling showed that the constant and reaction rate for the desorption of product molecules were very high \nand Supplementary \n) due to the huge contribution of the translational partition function of gas-phase molecules at high temperatures. Thus, the direct desorption of CO from the cobalt site can occur smoothly even with the large energy barrier. \nrepresents the energy diagram of C\n\nH\n\ndehydrogenation, where two hydrogen atoms of C\n\nH\n\nare subsequently eliminated and moved to infinity (opposite surface of the slab). The two C–H activations were endothermic on the Pt\n\nIn\n\n-based surfaces, whereas they were slightly exothermic on Pt, which may be dependent on whether the eliminated hydrogen atoms were located on a less stable Pt–Pt(Co) bridge site or on a highly stable Pt\n\nhollow site. The high energy of the unstable hydrogen can be released after each C–H scission using the subsequent oxidation reaction (H + O → OH, Δ\nE\n= −86 or −115 kJ mol\n−1\n) (Supplementary \nand Supplementary Tables\n\n–\n\n). Thus, the net energy barriers for the ‘oxidative dehydrogenation of C\n\nH\n\n(C\n\nH\n\n+ O → C\n\nH\n\n+ H\n\nO)’ on Pt\n\nIn\n\n-based surface is not higher than that of C–O scission (Supplementary \n). \nsummarizes the major energy barriers on each surface. The Pt surface was more active than the Pt\n\nIn\n\n-based surfaces for C–H and CO\n\nactivations, while CO desorption showed the highest energy barrier. For Pt\n\nIn\n\n, CO\n\nactivation required a high energy barrier of 169.1 kJ mol\n−1\n, which agreed well with the experimental\nE\nA\n* (168.8 kJ mol\n−1\n; \nand Supplementary \n) and with the low CO\n\nconversion and TOF of Pt–In/CeO\n\nand Supplementary \n). The\nE\nA\nof CO\n\nactivation was significantly decreased to 135.1 kJ mol\n−1\non Pt\n\nIn\n\n–Co, which is also consistent with the experimental\nE\nA\n* (138.3 kJ mol\n−1\n; \n) and the significantly improved CO\n\nconversion/TOF \nand Supplementary \n), by cobalt substitution. Good agreements were also obtained between the theoretical and experimental\nE\nA\n* values for C–H activation \n), demonstrating the validity of our calculation. The CO\n\nactivation still provided the highest energy barrier on Pt\n\nIn\n\n–Co, which is consistent with the fact that this process is the RDS. The significant decrease in the energy barriers of C–H and CO\n\nactivations by cobalt substitution can be explained by the lowering of the final state energies \n) in line with the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship\n\n. The cobalt atom strongly captures the carbon and/or hydrogen atom of the adsorbate, thus stabilizing the adsorbate state. The stronger adsorption on Co can be rationalized by the\nd\nband structure of alloys, as shown in \n. Alloying platinum with indium decreased the\nd\nband width and the density of states near the Fermi level. This change weakens the metal–adsorbate bonding in accordance with the\nd\nband theory\n\n,\n\n. In contrast, Pt\n\nIn\n\n–Co has a high density of states derived from the cobalt 3\nd\norbitals near the Fermi level, which recovers the adsorption strengths of carbon and hydrogen, hence promoting the conversion of CO\n\nand C\n\nH\n\n. Thus, the DFT calculations well supported the experimental results and clarified the role of cobalt in the enhanced catalysis.\n\n, Energy diagrams of CO\n\nreduction to CO and O (\na\n) and C\n\nH\n\ndehydrogenation to C\n\nH\n\n(\nb\n) on Pt, Pt\n\nIn\n\n and Pt\n\nIn\n\n–Co.\nc\n, Summary of the energy barriers on each surface.

Both the C\n\nH\n\ndehydrogenation and CO\n\nreduction smoothly proceed on the Pt–Co active site to form 2H and O, as well as the main products: C\n\nH\n\nand CO. Alloying with indium enhances the C\n\nH\n\nselectivity due to the ensemble effect and decreases the amount of coke that accumulates on the catalyst surface. The doped cobalt improves the adsorption strengths of the carbon and hydrogen species, which promotes the activation of C\n\nH\n\nand CO\n\n. The oxygen atoms oxidize the eliminated hydrogen to form H\n\nO or combust coke on the alloy surface or neighbouring CeO\n\nsites. Note that coke combustion is allowed when CO\n\nconversion is higher than C\n\nH\n\nconversion because of the stoichiometry of the CO\n\n-ODP. Coke can be combusted also by the lattice oxygen of CeO\n\n, where CeO\n\nis partially reduced to form an oxygen vacancy. This oxygen vacancy is refilled by an oxygen atom derived from CO\n\nactivation, enabling continuous coke combustion through the redox of CeO\n\n. Thus, CeO\n\ncan facilitate coke combustion via a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism\n\n, which significantly enhances the coke resistance and catalyst stability. Further information on the reaction mechanism can be obtained from the results of the DDP over Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nshown in Supplementary \n. It is worth noting that no CO\nx\n(CO and CO\n\n) was formed at all during the DDP, indicating that lattice oxygen of CeO\n\ndoes not combust C\nx\nH\ny\n. Thus, only carbonaceous species can be combusted by surface oxygen atom or lattice oxygen of CeO\n\n. Moreover, C\n\nH\n\nconversion in the DDP at 550 °C was relatively high (30%) and close to the the equilibrium conversion (43%; Supplementary \n) at the beginning of the reaction. This indicates that Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\npossesses a high catalytic activity for C–H activation even in the absence of CO\n\n, although it was immediately deactivated due to the lack of coke combustion. These results suggest that CO\n\ndoes not drastically change the kinetics of the dehydrogenation step, but mainly shifts the equilibrium limitation. Thus, C\n\nH\n\ndehydrogenation and CO\n\nconversion are parallel to each other and linked by the hydrogen oxidation processes, which is highly consistent with the mechanism proposed in this study.\nDiscussion\nWe designed and prepared a Pt–Co–In ternary alloy on CeO\n\nas a highly efficient catalyst for the CO\n\n-ODP. This material comprises small nanoparticles (2–3 nm) with a (Pt\n1−\nx\nCo\nx\n)\n\nIn\n\npseudo-binary alloy structure, where platinum, cobalt and indium are adjacent to each other on an atomic level. Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\nexhibits outstanding catalytic activity, C\n\nH\n\nselectivity, long-term stability and CO\n\nutilization efficiency. Alloying platinum with indium and cobalt significantly enhances the selectivity and activity, respectively, while the CeO\n\nsupport drastically improves the catalyst stability by Mars–van Krevelen-type coke combustion. The results obtained in this study provide not only a highly efficient catalytic system for alkane dehydrogenation and CO\n\nreduction, but also significant insights for material design based on multimetallic alloys.\n\nCatalyst preparation\nPt/CeO\n\n, Pt–Co/CeO\n2,\nPt–In/CeO\n\n, Pt–Sn/CeO\n\nand Pt–Co–In/CeO\n\n(Pt, 3 wt%) were prepared by a conventional impregnation method using H"

Then, 5.6 mg of Rh (III) nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, ~36% Rh basis), which provided ~2.0 mg of Rh metal, was weighed and dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water. The prepared Rh salt solution was slowly introduced into the prepared CeO\n\naqueous dispersion by syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min\n–1\nwhile the aqueous solution was being stirred, creating an aqueous mixture containing both Rh\n3+\n\nand CeO\n\nnanorods. This aqueous mixture of Rh\n3+\nand ceria nanorods was continuously stirred for an additional 3 h. The pH of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradual introduction of ammonium hydroxide solution (Aldrich, 28%) while the aqueous mixture was being stirred, followed by continuous stirring for an additional 5 h. The aqueous mixture was then centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, after which the upper layer was decanted. The solid product thus obtained was dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 250 °C for 2 h to obtain the as-synthesized Rh\n\n/CeO\n\ncatalyst. The actual loading of Rh on CeO\n\nnanorods of the as-synthesized catalyst was measured by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry, and was found to be 0.17 wt%. Thus, either 0.17 wt% Rh/CeO\n\nor Rh\n\n/CeO\n\nis used interchangeably to denote the as-synthesized catalyst in the following sections.\nCatalytic tests\nThe catalyst (50 mg) was mixed with 300 mg of quartz for SRM. The catalytic performance of the Rh\n\n/CeO\n\ncatalyst was evaluated in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the temperature range 350–600 °C. A K-type thermal couple was inserted into the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature, which was controlled by a proportional integral derivative controller. The catalyst was pretreated in H\n\n(5% in Ar, 20 ml min\n–1\n) at 500 °C for 1 h before catalysis. Water was introduced by syringe pump, in the form of vapour formed in a vaporization chamber held at 120 °C, before entering the reactor. Water vapour flow rate was kept at twice that of CH\n\n(10% in Ar, 20 ml min\n–1\n), which was premixed with water vapour before being flowed into the reactor. To ensure that water vapour could be fully delivered to the catalyst bed, all stainless steel tubing and valves between the vaporization chamber and reactor were heated and maintained at 120 °C during evaluation of catalytic performance. The products were analysed by an online gas chromatograph equipped with a Hayasep-D column and thermal conductivity detector. The conversion of CH\n\nand yield to H\n\nwas evaluated as follows, with\n\\([{{\\mathrm{CH}}}_{4}]_{{\\mathrm{in}}}\\)\n,\n\\([{{\\mathrm{CH}}}_{4}]_{{\\mathrm{out}}}\\)\nand\n\\([{{\\mathrm{H}}}_{2}]_{{\\mathrm{out}}}\\)\nrepresenting CH\n\nconcentration at the reactor inlet and CH\n\nand H\n\nconcentrations at the reactor outlet, respectively.\n$${\\mathrm{Conversion}}\\left( {\\rm{CH}_{4}} \\right) = \\frac{{[{\\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{in} - [{\\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{out}}}{{[{\\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{in}}} \\times 100{{{\\mathrm{\\% }}}}$$\n\n$${\\rm{Yield}}\\left( {{\\rm{H}_{2}}} \\right) = \\frac{{\\frac{1}{3}[{\\rm{H}_{2}}]_{out}}}{{[{\\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{in}}} \\times 100{{{\\mathrm{\\% }}}}$$\n\nCatalyst characterization\nIn situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments were mainly performed on beamline BL36XU at SPring-8. The Rh K-edge signal was collected under fluorescence mode by a Ge detector. Data were calibrated, merged and analysed using Athena and Artemis software packages with the standard protocol\n\n. For in situ experiments, the catalyst powder was loaded in a capillary quartz tube cell\n\n. The gas was then introduced into the cell, with flow rate controlled by mass flow controllers. In terms of reduction, 20 ml min\n–1\n5% H\n\nwas introduced to the reactor. In regard to catalysis, the composition of the SRM reactant mixture was CH\n\n(2.5 ml min\n–1\n), He (22.5 ml min\n–1\n) and water vapour. The cell was heated, then maintained at the desired temperature for 30 min in a flow of 5% H\n\nin He for the reduction or in a flow of the reactant mixture for SRM, then the Rh K-edge spectrum was collected in situ in the flowing gas at about 150 °C. For the fitting of Fourier-transformed EXAFS data, CN, distance (Å) and Debye–Waller factor (\nσ\n\n) were set as variables. WT analysis of EXAFS data was performed with the HAMA Fortran package from the ERSF website. Parameters used in these analyses were the Morlet function,\nσ\n= 1 and\nκ\n= 5 (Supplementary Note\n\n).\nSurface chemistry of the catalyst under reduction and catalysis conditions was tracked with a commercial AP-XPS system\n\n. A reaction cell was assembled with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source and an energy analyser with precise geometry. The mixture of reactant gases at Torr pressure, with the ratio of partial pressure of CH\n\nand H\n\nO vapour at 1:2, was introduced to the reaction cell through a gas manifold maintained at a 120–150 °C for delivery of water vapour to the reaction cell. The partial pressures of CH\n\nand H\n\nO (vapour) were 0.5 and 1.0 Torr, respectively. The total flow rate of gas mixture entering the in situ reaction cell was ~4 ml min\n–1\n(\n). The total pressure of reactant gases in the reaction cell was the average value of those measured by one capacitance gauge located between the gas manifold and tubing to the entrance port of the reaction cell, and by another placed between the exit port tubing of the reaction cell. XPS data were analysed using CasaXPS software. All spectrum peaks were calibrated by the Au 4\nf\n7/2\npeak to 84.0 eV. Ce 3d spectra were deconvoluted into ten components, whereas six peaks at 882.6, 889.0, 898.6, 900.9, 907.7 and 916.9 eV are assigned to v, vʺ, vʹʺ, u, uʺ and uʹʺ of Ce\n4+\n, respectively while four at 880.6, 885.2, 899.2 and 904.0 eV were assigned to v\no\n, vʹ, u\no\nand uʹ of Ce\n3+\n, respectively\n\n.\nDRIFTS spectra of CO molecules absorbed on the catalyst using guest CO source were collected on a Thermo-Fisher Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer using an MCT/A detector with a spectrum resolution of 4 cm\n−1\nand integrated with a diffuse reflectance reaction cell (Praying Mantis high-temperature reaction cell) at our collaborators’ laboratories at Fuzhou University (FZU). A home-made gas inlet system, including a six-way valve, was used to perform transient studies. Here, we describe this as an ex situ study to distinguish it from the operando studies described below. The purpose of this ex situ study was to identify the chemical state and dispersion of Rh atoms of the as-synthesized catalyst, 0.17 wt%Rh/CeO\n\n. In this ex situ study, the catalyst was mounted in the cell without dilution and was pretreated in a helium flow (99.999%) to remove surface adsorbates before the experiment. Different from these ex situ DRIFTS studies, operando DRIFTS experiments were performed to identify the CO stretching frequency of active sites of the catalyst formed during SRM catalysis and whether these active sites could restructure under different CO partial pressures. The experimental protocol is summarized in Supplementary Note\n\n.\nThe morphology, size and distribution of single atoms of as-prepared 0.17 wt%Rh/CeO\n\nsamples and samples with different pretreatment or after catalysis were examined with advanced TEM instruments at our collaborators’ laboratories, including FZU (Supplementary Note\n\n). In a typical sample preparation, 10 mg of catalyst powder was dispersed in 50 ml of anhydrous ethanol and sonicated for 5 min. Then, 50 μl of the liquid suspension was dropcast on a copper mesh (300-mesh) with carbon nanofilm. Copper mesh and sample were dried overnight before loading on the sample stage for TEM. The morphology and lattice fringes of ceria were then characterized."

For the W\nx\nO\ny\ncluster/Pt, we put a W\n\nO\nx\ncluster on Pt slabs of 4 layers. In order to eliminate periodic image interactions, we used a big Pt slab (5 × 4) to support one trimer. For the (WO\n\n)\nn\nmonolayer/Pt , we used a (4 × 2) Pt slab to support the (WO\n\n)\n\n2D monolayer structure \n). For each calculation, the bottom two layers of the Pt slab were fixed at the bulk position while the top two layers with the supported oxide cluster and adsorbates were fully relaxed. We applied a Monkhorst–Pack mesh\n\n. The\nk\n-points were (3 × 2 × 1) and (2 × 4 × 1) for the 5 × 4 slabs and the monolayer supercells, respectively. Transition state searches were carried out using the climbing-image VTST NEB method\n\n. For geometry optimization calculations, the cut-off energy was set to 520 eV and the energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10\n−5\neV and 0.01 eV Å\n−1\n, respectively. In the NEB calculations, the force criterion was set to 0.025 eV Å\n−1\n. We used pMuTT (\n), together with the DFT-calculated reaction energies and vibrational frequencies, to simulate a phase diagram.\nSimulated phase diagrams\nThermodynamic phase diagrams were generated using the PhaseDiagram function in pMuTT (\n). DFT reaction energies and frequencies were used to calculate Gibbs free energies.

The PhaseDiagram function in pMuTT generates a graph of grids, where each grid represents the most stable state under a certain reaction condition.\nState-based MKM\n\nwas performed using the CHEMKIN package. A batch reactor was chosen to study the reduction kinetics of WO\nx\n/Pt using H\n\n/H\n\nO mixed gas at different temperatures. Two sites were considered in this model: the Pt site and the WO\nx\nsite. The Pt site is responsible for H\n\nactivation, while the tungsten oxides can be hydrogenated and hydrated to generate hydroxyl groups. H-spillover from Pt to WO\nx\nsites can also reduce the oxide by forming H\n\nO. Due to the huge set of structures of all possible hydrogenated/hydrated tungsten oxides, we did not calculate all activation energies in the reaction network using DFT. Instead, we estimated them using Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationships developed herein from a smaller subset of DFT calculations (Supplementary \n). To keep the chemical potential of H\n\nand H\n\nO constant during the reaction, we chose a small surface area to volume ratio of 10\n−20\ncm\n−1\nfor the batch reactor. For the calculations starting with fully oxidized W\n\nO\n\nclusters, the reaction time for every condition in MKM was set to 36,000 s. For the re-oxidation of W\n\nO\n\nclusters, the MKM reaction times were set to 10\n\ns. The Brønsted acid density heatmaps were generated by calculating the OH group coverages at each reaction condition at long times. The heatmaps were smoothed by interpolation.\nXANES simulation\nXANES simulation of W atoms was carried out using FDMNES (refs.\n\n,\n\n), where the convoluted L\n\nedge spectra of all W atoms in each supercell were calculated using the muffin-tin approximation with a radius of 4.0 Å. To account for broadening effects (for example, core–hole lifetime), a Lorentzian energy-dependent convolution was applied to the calculated spectrum. The energy range was set to −20 to 80 eV relative to the Fermi level. The simulated spectra were aligned with the experimental spectra of W standards (WO\n\nand WO\n\n) using the first inflection point.\n\nCatalyst synthesis\nThe 4 wt% Pt/C catalyst was prepared by the conventional incipient wetness impregnation method, as described previously\n\n,\n\n.

Different spin states of the catalytic Co atom in Aza-CMP-Co were calculated under different oxidation states to determine the corresponding structure with the lowest energy. For the Co\n2+\nstate, the quartet [Co\n2+\n(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\nwas calculated to be the ground state at the experimental pH, corresponding to the Co-N\n\n/O\n\nmoiety in EXAFS analysis (Supplementary \n).

Therefore, the KIE\nH/D\nof Aza-CMP-Co was determined to confirm the proton transfer process during the catalytic rate-determining step (RDS). The LSV of Aza-CMP-Co/CP in a 1.0 M NaOD D\n\nO solution shows a lower current density compared with that in 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution \n). The corresponding KIE\nH/D\nvalues are <1.5 over the catalytic overpotential range 0.30–0.36 V. Meanwhile, consistent with LSV-derived results, KIEs measured by chronoamperometry were close to 1.4 within the overpotential range of 0.30–0.36 V under alkaline conditions. KIE values under alkaline conditions were further examined with different fractions of deuterium (n). As OD\n–\nconcentration increased, the KIE kept increasing but always remained <1.5, indicating a secondary KIE where O-H bond cleavage may not be directly involved in the RDS (Supplementary \n). For near-neutral conditions, larger KIE\nH/D\nvalues (>1.8) could be determined in borate buffer over the catalytic overpotential range, demonstrating a primary KIE effect \n). The absence of primary KIE in Aza-CMP-Co suggested that, under alkaline conditions, O-H bond cleavage was not involved in the RDS and the decoupled ET process may be the RDS of OER. By contrast, a markedly different behaviour was observed for the cobalt hydroxide electrode (Supplementary Note\n\n): a KIE value of ~2.4 was observed at the catalytic potential, suggesting that O-H bond cleavage is involved in the RDS under alkaline conditions.\nTo a certain extent, pH-dependent OER activity can reflect the concerted or non-concerted proton–electron transfer characteristic of the RDS\n\n,\n\n. Potential shifts at the catalytic current density of 2.0 mA cm\n−2\nwere calculated to evaluate the pH-dependent OER activity of Aza-CMP-Co. Under near-neutral and alkaline conditions, the potentials of OER catalytic waves shifted with pH and slopes close to −59 mV pH\n−1\nwere determined by linear fitting, indicating that Aza-CMP-Co exhibits negligible pH-dependent OER activities with a zero-order dependence on OH\n−\nconcentration at the RHE scale ,g\n)\n\n. As shown in ,e\n\nexperimental CV of Aza-CMP-Co was compared with theoretically expected CV behaviour based on a model with an irreversibly adsorbed monolayer of reactants attached to electrode surfaces. A complete mathematical description of electrochemical response equations is presented in Supplementary Note\n\n. The CV of Aza-CMP-Co produces a good quantitative match with the prediction based on an irreversible monolayer adsorption model \n). For the Co\n2+/3+\nredox couple, the current–potential data calculated are shown by the points plotted in Supplementary \n. This plot is in excellent agreement with the experimental curve, indicating that Aza-CMP-Co could be treated as adsorbed cobalt monolayers (loading of 8.5 × 10\n–9\n\nexperimental voltammograms are similar in onset shape but significantly different after the peak current. Similarly, the calculated Co\n4+/3+\nreduction wave is consistent with the experimental result at potentials lower than the peak point. The current mismatch after Co\n3+/4+\n\nexperimental CV. The electrochemical properties of the catalyst were evaluated using the above quantitative analysis, and the molecular nature of as-fabricated Aza-CMP-Co was examined based on an irreversible monolayer adsorption model. Electrochemical quantitative CV analysis provides a good way of proving the molecular features and uniformity of the chemical environment of the catalytic centre compared with other advanced physical characterization techniques; therefore, CV analysis should be considered, especially for so-called single-atom catalysts, to identify the homogeneity of redox species in a specific molecular structure before corresponding reaction mechanism studies are carried out.\npH-related nucleophilic attack\nWhen the catalytically rate-limiting O-O bond formation involves the APT in the WNA pathway, the addition of an anion (such as phosphate, acetate or borate) as a proton acceptor significantly increases the water oxidation reaction rate\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. To gain insight into the RDS intermediate states under different pH values, the role(s) of mediated APT in cobalt site-catalysed water oxidation was investigated by the addition of different concentrations of borate or phosphate under varying pH –d\n\nexperimental difficulties in establishing the operational reaction mechanism. Activation energy is dependent only on the intrinsic properties of the reaction pathway for a given catalyst. Therefore, to gain insights into intrinsic OER activity and explore the differences in cobalt sites in both alkaline and near-neutral OER catalysis, activation energy was measured in both NaOH and NaBi buffer solutions through temperature-controlled electrocatalysis (Supplementary Note\n\n). As shown in ,c\n, the OER activities of Aza-CMP-Co exhibit an exact temperature-dependent feature in both NaOH and NaBi solutions. The corresponding Arrhenius plots of the natural logarithm of current at various potentials (ln\n\nexperimental and calculation results for the cobalt sites in alkaline electrolytes demonstrated lower activation energies, different pH-dependent redox features, lower KIEs, negligible reaction order with respect to the external anion and absence of cation effects \n). Based on these results, the key to understanding the wide performance gap between catalysed OER performances in alkaline and near-neutral electrolytes is the p\n\nexperimental observations and calculations, catalytic cycles that included four PCET processes were proposed for cobalt sites catalysing the OER \n). Deprotonation occurs during the conversion of Co\n2+\n\nexperimental evidence and calculation results. Owing to the formation of extra -OH groups during the non-concerted PCET process of Co\n2+\n/Co\n3+\nin alkaline electrolytes, the Co-OOH fragment tends to be generated via an intramolecular hydroxyl nucleophilic attack pathway where the adjacent -OH attacks the oxo ligand in Co\n4+\n=O to form an intramolecular O-O bond, yielding a secondary KIE\nH/D\nand pH-independent OER activity on the RHE scale. This pathway requires a significantly lower activation energy than that of intermolecular WNA under neutral conditions. Finally, the -OOH ligand transforms into dioxygen after a further 1H\n+\n/1e\n−\n\nExperimental and theoretical results based on this model catalyst, with well-defined catalytic single-site cobalt decoration, demonstrated that OER catalysed by a single cobalt site triggered a pH-controlled nucleophilic attack pathway. This transition of O-O bond formation pathways was controlled by PCET features of the pre-redox states—that is, p\n\nSynthesis of Aza-CMP\nA total of 532.5 mg (1.875 mmol) of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine tetrahydrochloride in 15 ml of anhydrous DMF and 390 mg (1.25 mmol) of hexaketocyclohexane octahydrate in 5 ml of anhydrous DMF were mixed and refluxed for 48 h under Ar. The resulting dark-brown solid was purified via hot extraction with methanol for 48 h using a Soxhlet extractor, then dried under vacuum at 150 °C for 24 h. Protonation-assisted exfoliation of the as-prepared bulk polymer was performed according to the reported literature\n\n. To summarize, Aza-CMP (100 mg) was dispersed in 100 ml of 12 M HCl, and the suspension was subjected to ultrasonication for 24 h. The mixture was diluted with deionized water and centrifuged at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 min to separate large aggregates. Exfoliated nanosheets were collected by filter (polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 45 μm) and washed thoroughly with water.\n\nSynthesis of Aza-CMP-Co\nAza-CMP material was modified with Co\n2+\nusing cobalt(II) acetate. Aza-CMP (20 mg) was immersed in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF and the suspension stirred for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere, with the gas bubbling through the solution. Next, 85 mg (1.5 eq. with respect to phenanthroline units) of cobalt(II) acetate was dissolved in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF under Ar. The Co solution was slowly added to the suspension under Ar, and the mixture was maintained in a dispersed state by ultrasonication for 8 h at room temperature. The solid was filtered and then washed with DMF, water, methanol and ethanol until the filtrate became colourless. Finally, the product was dried at 80 °C under vacuum conditions. Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) was fabricated via the same procedure while replacing the as-prepared bulk Aza-CMP with exfoliated Aza-CMP.\n\nPreparation of catalyst inks and film on the electrode\nThe catalyst was dispersed in a water/ethanol 1:1 solution to form an ink, which was prepared by immersion of 5 mg of catalyst in a solution containing 0.25 ml each of water and ethanol.

Moreover, WT analysis results of Aza-CMP-Co and Aza-CMP-Co (posted) exhibit similar intensity maxima at 3.90 and 3.87 Å\n−1\n, respectively, suggesting that Aza-CMP-Co exists as mononuclear metal centres after OER \n). Notably, the redox features and catalytic current density of Aza-CMP-Co are preserved after 400 CV scans in various electrolytes, revealing good stability of single-site cobalt toward OER under broad pH conditions (Supplementary \n). For Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated), aggregation of the cobalt component was observed in EDX elemental mapping images –l\nand Supplementary \n). \nshows numerous cobalt sites present in the selected area after catalysis. However, nano-oxide clusters and crystalline oxide slices were also generated during OER ,o\n). Compared with the XPS spectra of Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) before and after catalysis, the shifted Co 2p peak at 779.7 eV and the new O 1s peak at 529.8 eV confirm the presence of cobalt oxide species ,q\n). The FT–IR features of the used Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) correspond to those of Aza-CMP-Co rather than those of pristine Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) in the sections marked 1, 2 and 3, implying a decrease in coordinated cobalt sites after catalysis \n). In summary, the dynamic evolution of the cobalt composition in Aza-CMP varied with metal site loading: with a relatively low metal loading, Aza-CMP-Co showed excellent structural stability while the increase in cobalt site loading to approximately 20 wt% (most SACs have a low metal content of <1 wt% (\n)) resulted in distinct decomposition of cobalt sites owing to the high concentration of molecular cobalt in the confined local area. Additionally, the formation of oxide phases explains the lower TOFs of Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) compared with those of Aza-CMP-Co and the asymmetric redox peak in Supplementary \n.\n\n,\nc\n, Atomic-resolution HAADF images of used Aza-CMP-Co in bulk (\nb\n) and thinner edge (\nc\n) (red circles indicate molecular sites).\nd\n,\ne\n, XPS spectra of used Aza-CMP-Co/CP in regions Co 2p (\nd\n) and O 1s (\ne\n).\nf\n, Normalized Co K-edge XANES spectra of Aza-CMP-Co and Aza-CMP-Co (posted).\ng\n,\nh\n, k\n\n-Weighted Co K-edge FT EXAFS spectra of Aza-CMP-Co and Aza-CMP-Co (posted) in R (\ng\n) and k space (\nh\n).\ni\n, WT of Aza-CMP-Co (posted).\nj\n–\nl\n, HAADF–STEM image (\nj\n), merged elemental mapping image (\nk\n) and cobalt mapping image (\nl\n) of used Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated).\nm\n–\no\n, Atomic-resolution HAADF images of used Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) in single-atom area (\nm\n), mixed area (\nn\n) and crystalline area (\no\n);\no\n, inset: FT pattern of the selected area.\np\n,\nq\n, XPS spectra of used Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated)/CP for regions Co 2p (\np\n) and O 1s (\nq\n).\nr\n, FT–IR spectra of used Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated)/CP.\nFull size image\nOER mechanistic insights\nOxygen evolution reaction under mild pH conditions generally suffers from low activity and high overpotential. Although Aza-CMP-Co catalysts exhibited good performance under near-neutral conditions compared with other reported systems, significant performance loss in terms of overpotential, onset potential, Tafel slopes and TOFs occurred when the alkaline electrolyte was exchanged for a mildly basic example. Molecularly well-defined Aza-CMP-Co catalysts, containing Co\n2+\nactive sites on a regular CMP matrix, provide an excellent platform for mechanistic studies. Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) showed the highest geometric current density but suffered from active site decomposition during catalysis. In addition, because Aza-CMP-Co exhibited higher TOFs than those of Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) under basic and near-neutral conditions, the former was selected for kinetic studies. The level of oxygen electrochemically generated from the Aza-CMP-Co system was confirmed using a pressure transducer. Quantitative yields of Aza-CMP-Co were 98.8% in 1.0 M NaOH and 98.3% in 0.5 M NaBi, indicating that the accumulated charge passed through Aza-CMP-Co electrodes can be almost quantitatively consumed in OER (Supplementary \n). To confirm that the cobalt sites in Aza-CMP-Co induced OER activity, an EDTA treatment experiment was performed. The presence of a strongly chelating EDTA ligand in the solution resulted in detachment of Co ions from the coordination sites in Aza-CMP-Co\n\n. As shown in Supplementary \n, the treated sample lost its redox features and OER activity. Thus, water oxidation currents were achieved by the coordinated cobalt sites in Aza-CMP-Co during catalysis.\nKinetics under aqueous conditions\nLinear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of Aza-CMP-Co/CP shows similar OER current densities under both stationary and rotating conditions, demonstrating efficient mass transport on the electrode surface during water oxidation, which is expected for 2D porous structures (Supplementary \n). Kinetic studies were conducted to understand OER catalysis by cobalt sites, and the performance gap, along with a wide range of pH conditions. The pH-dependent performance studies were conducted in NaOH solutions in the absence of buffer anions to investigate the proton–electron transfer process of cobalt active sites under alkaline conditions. The distinct electrochemical signal of the higher-valence cobalt states facilitates tracking and interpretation of the evolution of active cobalt sites during the OER cycle. CV and DPV performed at the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale were used to determine proton participation in the Co\n2+/3+\nand Co\n3+/4+\nredox and oxygen evolution processes \n). As illustrated on the Pourbaix diagram \n), the slope of the Co\n2+/3+\nredox was −117 mV pH\n−1\n, corresponding to a two-proton/one-electron transfer process (2H\n+\n/1e\n−\n). For the Co\n3+/4+\nredox couple, the slope was −63 mV pH\n−1\n, corresponding to a 1H\n+\n/1e\n−\ntransfer process. Notably, these proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) features are consistent with those of reported molecular cobalt-based heterogeneous electrocatalysts\n\n, and different from cobalt hydroxides under alkaline conditions (Supplementary Note\n\n)\n\n. The pH-dependence studies were also conducted under near-neutral conditions using either borate \nand Supplementary \n) or phosphate (Supplementary \n) buffer anions. As illustrated in the Pourbaix diagram, the redox potentials plotted in the pH 6.0–13.0 range are independent of the type of buffer anion \nand Supplementary \n). The first redox process observed in the pH 6.0– 9.0 range was assigned to the oxidation of [N\n\nL\n\nCo\n2+\n(OH\n\n)\n\n] to [N\n\nL\n\nCo\n3+\n(OH\n\n)(OH)], with concomitant loss of one proton (L represents a OH or H\n\nO ligand according to the Co-N\n\n/O\n\nmoiety as determined by EXAFS analysis, and N denotes a coordinated nitrogen atom of Aza-CMP). Interestingly, a clear inflection point occurred in the Co\n2+/3+\nline at pH >9.0, and a two-proton transfer process from [N\n\nL\n\nCo\n2+\n(OH\n\n)\n\n] to [N\n\nL\n\nCo\n3+\n(OH)\n\n] is proposed according to the slope value of −115 mV pH\n−1\n. This slope is also consistent with the Pourbaix diagram of Aza-CMP-Co in unbuffered alkaline solution \n). Therefore, the p\nK\na\nvalue of [N\n\nL\n\nCo\n3+\n(OH\n\n)(OH)] is close to 9.0. In addition, the line attributed to the PCET process of Co\n3+/4+\nmaintained its 1H\n+\n/1e\n−\nfeature over a wide range of pH (6.0–13.0), which implies that cobalt sites can undergo a similar Co\n3+/4+\npathway over a wide range of pH, rendering pH crucial in accessing reactive catalytic species. Notably, the redox properties of Co\n2+/3+\nand Co\n3+/4+\nin Aza-CMP-Co are similar to those of Ru\n2+/3+\nand Ru\n3+/4+\nin\ncis\n-[(bpy)\n\nRu\nII\n(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n2+\n(bpy, 2,2′-bipyridine), in which the inflection point is observed in the Ru\n2+/3+\nline at pH 5.5 (\n).\n\n, CV and DPV curves of Aza-CMP-Co under different pH conditions (unbuffered NaOH solutions) (\na\n) and corresponding Pourbaix diagram (scan rate, 50 mV s\n−1\n, without iR compensation) (\nb\n).\nc\n, pH-dependent OER activity (potential determined at 2.0 mA cm\n−2\n).\nd\n, LSV curves of Aza-CMP-Co in 1.0 M NaOD/D\n\nO and NaOH/H\n\nO solutions (scan rate, 5 mV s\n−1\n); inset: KIE against potential.\ne\n,\nf\n, CV curves of Aza-CMP-Co under different pH conditions (borate buffered solutions) (\ne\n) and corresponding Pourbaix diagram (scan rate, 50 mV s\n−1\n, without iR compensation) (\nf\n).\ng\n, pH-dependent OER activity (potential determined at 2.0 mA cm\n−2\nin NaBi buffer).\nh\n, LSV curves of Aza-CMP-Co in 0.1 M NaBi/D\n\nO and NaBi/H\n\nO solutions (scan rate, 5 mV s\n−1\n); inset, KIE against overpotential.\ni\n, CV curves of Aza-CMP-Co and Aza-CMP on CP in dry acetonitrile (scan rate, 50 mV s\n−1\n).\nj\n, CV curves of Aza-CMP-Co following addition of water and NaOH to the non-aqueous electrolyte.\nk\n, DPV curves of Aza-CMP-Co in acetonitrile and water/NaOH with acetonitrile electrolytes added.\nl\n, CV calculated for Aza-CMP-Co (1.0 M NaOH; scan rate, 50 mV s\n−1\n).\nFull size image\nDensity functional theory calculations were applied to verify the configuration of cobalt sites under different oxidation states. The functional choice was rationalized by screening several non-hybrid and hybrid functionals, and comparing the calculated results with experimental values (Supplementary Note\n\n). Different spin states of the catalytic Co atom in Aza-CMP-Co were calculated under different oxidation states to determine the corresponding structure with the lowest energy. For the Co\n2+\nstate, the quartet [Co\n2+\n(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\nwas calculated to be the ground state at the experimental pH, corresponding to the Co-N\n\n/O\n\nmoiety in EXAFS analysis (Supplementary \n). After oxidization to the Co\n3+\nstate, a p\nK\na\nof 8.3 was calculated for the [Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n/[Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)] redox, which agrees well with the experimental value of 9.0 from the Pourbaix diagram. Meanwhile, further deprotonation of [Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)] to form [Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n]\n−\nproved unfavourable due to high p\nK\na\n(25.3). Although the singlet state of [Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\nhas lower energy than both the triplet and quintet, the triplet state of [Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)] has lower energy than both the singlet and quintet. Therefore, {[Co\n2+\n(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n}\nQ\nis oxidized via a 1H\n+\n/1e\n−\nprocess to form {[Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n}\nS\nunder relatively low-pH (<8.3) conditions, and undergoes a 2H\n+\n/1e\n−\nprocess to form [Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)]\nT\nunder high-pH (>8.3) conditions. For the Co\n4+\nstate, the calculated p\nK\na\nof [Co\n4+\n=O(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n/[Co\n4+\n=O(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)] is 10.4. Further deprotonation of [Co\n4+\n=O(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)]/[Co\n4+\n=O(OH)\n\n]\n–\nis also unfavourable due to high p\nK\na\n(31.9). The p\nK\na\nanalysis indicates that at low (<10.4) and high pH (>10.4), Co\n4+\nspecies exist as [Co\n4+\n=O(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\nand [Co\n4+\n=O(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)], respectively. Specifically, the quartet states of [Co\n4+\n=O(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\nand [Co\n4+\n=O(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)] have lower energies than their doublet and sextet states. Therefore, at low pH (<8.3), {[Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n}\nS\nis oxidized to {[Co\n4+\n=O(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n}\nQ\nvia a 1H\n+\n/1e\n−\nprocess; at high pH (>10.4), oxidation from [Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)]\nT\nto [Co\n4+\n=O(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)]\nQ\nrepresent an additional 1H\n+\n/1e\n−\nprocess. Further oxidation of {[Co\n4+\n=O(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n}\nQ\nor [Co\n4+\n=O(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)]\nQ\nleads to Co\n3+\nstate geometry with a coupled O-O bond, indicating that Co\n4+\n=O is the highest oxidation state. The formation of an O-O bond from Co\n4+\n=O species has previously been proposed and is widely accepted\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Additionally, the redox potentials of Co\n2+\n/Co\n3+\nand Co\n3+\n/Co\n4+\nunder different pH conditions were calculated accordingly (Supplementary \n). At low pH (8.0), the calculated redox potentials of {[Co\n2+\n(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n}\nQ\n/{[Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n}\ns\nand {[Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n}\ns\n/{[Co\n4+\n=O(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n}\nQ\nwere 1.18 and 1.40 V (versus NHE), respectively; while those of {[Co\n2+\n(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n]\n+\n}\nQ\n/[Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)]\nT\nand [Co\n3+\n(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)]\nT\n/[Co\n4+\n=O(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)]\nQ\nunder high pH (13.0) were 0.62 and 1.05 V (versus NHE), respectively. The calculated p\nK\na\nand redox potential values agree well with experimental data, indicating the validity of computational models and approaches.\nThe O-H bond (or hydrogen bond) cleavage is clearly involved in the concerted solution atom–proton transfer (APT) process (Supplementary Note\n\n), with the reaction exhibiting primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIE\nH/D\n> 1.5)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Therefore, the KIE\nH/D\nof Aza-CMP-Co was determined to confirm the proton transfer process during the catalytic rate-determining step (RDS). The LSV of Aza-CMP-Co/CP in a 1.0 M NaOD D\n\nO solution shows a lower current density compared with that in 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution \n). The corresponding KIE\nH/D\nvalues are <1.5 over the catalytic overpotential range 0.30–0.36 V. Meanwhile, consistent with LSV-derived results, KIEs measured by chronoamperometry were close to 1.4 within the overpotential range of 0.30–0.36 V under alkaline conditions. KIE values under alkaline conditions were further examined with different fractions of deuterium (n). As OD\n–\nconcentration increased, the KIE kept increasing but always remained <1.5, indicating a secondary KIE where O-H bond cleavage may not be directly involved in the RDS (Supplementary \n). For near-neutral conditions, larger KIE\nH/D\nvalues (>1.8) could be determined in borate buffer over the catalytic overpotential range, demonstrating a primary KIE effect \n). The absence of primary KIE in Aza-CMP-Co suggested that, under alkaline conditions, O-H bond cleavage was not involved in the RDS and the decoupled ET process may be the RDS of OER. By contrast, a markedly different behaviour was observed for the cobalt hydroxide electrode (Supplementary Note\n\n): a KIE value of ~2.4 was observed at the catalytic potential, suggesting that O-H bond cleavage is involved in the RDS under alkaline conditions.\nTo a certain extent, pH-dependent OER activity can reflect the concerted or non-concerted proton–electron transfer characteristic of the RDS\n\n,\n\n. Potential shifts at the catalytic current density of 2.0 mA cm\n−2\nwere calculated to evaluate the pH-dependent OER activity of Aza-CMP-Co. Under near-neutral and alkaline conditions, the potentials of OER catalytic waves shifted with pH and slopes close to −59 mV pH\n−1\nwere determined by linear fitting, indicating that Aza-CMP-Co exhibits negligible pH-dependent OER activities with a zero-order dependence on OH\n−\nconcentration at the RHE scale ,g\n)\n\n. As shown in ,e\nand Supplementary \n, the peak currents of Co\n2+/3+\nredox remained consistent under different pH conditions, suggesting that the number of reaction active sites in Aza-CMP-Co is not sensitive to changes in pH. The pH-independent OER activities and reaction active sites suggested that catalysis of OER by Aza-CMP-Co is a typical heterogeneous catalytic reaction in which the reaction rate depends on the number of active sites on the catalyst and catalytic driving forces, but not on reactant concentration\n\n. Meanwhile, pH-independent activities and primary KIEs satisfy the behaviour of a concerted APT mechanism for Aza-CMP-Co under near-neutral conditions. However, the absence of primary KIEs suggested that a non-concerted proton–electron transfer RDS occurred for Aza-CMP-Co under alkaline conditions. Thus, the detailed proton–electron transfer processes of Aza-CMP-Co during OER were systematically studied.\nNon-aqueous redox and quantitative CV analysis\nThe presence of Co\n4+\nis crucial for O-O bond formation\n\n. To prove the occurrence of successive redox states in the system during OER, CV was performed in a non-aqueous electrolyte (acetonitrile) in which the concentration of the substrate (H\n\nO, HO\n−\n) was considerably reduced. This suppressed OER allowed the electrochemical detection of higher-valent reactive intermediates\n\n. As shown in \nand Supplementary \n, as-fabricated Aza-CMP shows no dominant redox peaks in both CV and DPV while several oxidation peaks are present in the voltammogram of Aza-CMP-Co cast onto CP under anhydrous conditions. The chemical potentials of these oxidations were determined using DPV \n). Oxidation peaks at 0.13 and 0.47 V were assigned to the sequential oxidations of Co\n2+/3+\nand Co\n3+/4+\n, respectively, while the peaks at 0.67 and 0.88 V, which were undetectable under aqueous conditions, could be attributed to successive PCET processes. Closely spaced redox couples are common in PCET steps of molecular species\n\n. Aza-CMP-Co features four closely spaced redox couples from the 2+ oxidation state at a potential of 0.8 V. When water and NaOH were added to electrolyte, an apparent catalytic current was observed. The third and fourth redox peaks attributed to successive redox processes are immersed in the catalytic current when OER occurs \n). Since pH-independent activity and KIEs demonstrated the non-concerted proton–electron transfer characteristic of the RDS under alkaline conditions, one of the additional redox features may be attributed to the ET process of the RDS.\nThe experimental CV of Aza-CMP-Co was compared with theoretically expected CV behaviour based on a model with an irreversibly adsorbed monolayer of reactants attached to electrode surfaces. A complete mathematical description of electrochemical response equations is presented in Supplementary Note\n\n. The CV of Aza-CMP-Co produces a good quantitative match with the prediction based on an irreversible monolayer adsorption model \n). For the Co\n2+/3+\nredox couple, the current–potential data calculated are shown by the points plotted in Supplementary \n. This plot is in excellent agreement with the experimental curve, indicating that Aza-CMP-Co could be treated as adsorbed cobalt monolayers (loading of 8.5 × 10\n–9\nmol cm\n–2\n) with nearly ideal Nernstian reaction properties, further corroborating the molecular nature of Aza-CMP-Co. Co\n3+/4+\noxidation is an irreversible, one-step, one-electron reaction. With a transfer coefficient of 0.35 and loading of 8.5 × 10\n–9\nmol cm\n–2\n, the calculated and experimental voltammograms are similar in onset shape but significantly different after the peak current. Similarly, the calculated Co\n4+/3+\nreduction wave is consistent with the experimental result at potentials lower than the peak point. The current mismatch after Co\n3+/4+\npeak potential indicated that OER had been triggered by additional oxidized Co\n4+\nspecies (Supplementary \n). For OER current calculation at the foot of the wave area, the irreversible Co\n4+\noxidation reaction is assumed to be the RDS for OER, and the formal potential of Co\n4+\noxidation was obtained by DPV under non-aqueous conditions in \n, but with intrinsic limitations. As shown in \n, after all currents had been integrated, the calculated forward and backward scan currents matched well with the experimental CV. The electrochemical properties of the catalyst were evaluated using the above quantitative analysis, and the molecular nature of as-fabricated Aza-CMP-Co was examined based on an irreversible monolayer adsorption model. Electrochemical quantitative CV analysis provides a good way of proving the molecular features and uniformity of the chemical environment of the catalytic centre compared with other advanced physical characterization techniques; therefore, CV analysis should be considered, especially for so-called single-atom catalysts, to identify the homogeneity of redox species in a specific molecular structure before corresponding reaction mechanism studies are carried out.\npH-related nucleophilic attack\nWhen the catalytically rate-limiting O-O bond formation involves the APT in the WNA pathway, the addition of an anion (such as phosphate, acetate or borate) as a proton acceptor significantly increases the water oxidation reaction rate\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. To gain insight into the RDS intermediate states under different pH values, the role(s) of mediated APT in cobalt site-catalysed water oxidation was investigated by the addition of different concentrations of borate or phosphate under varying pH –d\nand Supplementary \n; see\n\nMethods\nfor definition of borate and phosphate reaction order, ρ\n[borate]\nand ρ\n[phosphate]\n). The diffusion-controlled solution APT process is influenced by the concentration of external anions in the electrolyte, and first-order reactions with respect to the anions are widely observed in catalyst-modified electrodes when the RDS of OER proceeds through the APT pathway \n)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. For borate buffer, the anion effect is absent at pH 11.0 and 13.3 but pronounced at pH 7.7 –d\n). The ρ\n[borate]\nfor the cobalt sites is approximately 0.5–0.7 over the entire catalytic potential range under pH 7.7 electrolyte. Similarly, ρ\n[phosphate]\nfor cobalt sites is approximately 0.4–0.5 under pH 7.0 conditions (Supplementary \n). Considering the relatively small KIE\nH/D\nvalue under near-neutral conditions (~1.8) and the presence of nearby uncoordinated N sites in Aza-CMP, the solution APT process—combined with a second-coordination-sphere-involved proton transfer process—occurs at cobalt sites under neutral conditions\n\n. However, the ρ\n[borate]\nvalues for pH 11.0 and 13.3, as well as the ρ\n[phosphate]\nvalues for pH 12.6, are close to zero over the entire catalytic potential range. By contrast, the reaction order with respect to phosphate (ρ\n[phosphate]\n) for cobalt hydroxide is calculated at ~0.4 under pH 12.6 conditions, indicating different reaction mechanisms from those of Aza-CMP-Co and closer involvement of anions in RDS (Supplementary \n). As the counterpart of anions, cations also show significant interactions with the active oxygenated intermediates generated in OER. Alkaline earth cations disturb the hydrogen bond network of water molecules\n\n, thereby influencing the interaction with surface intermediates\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Meanwhile, cations possess different solvation strengths (Li\n+\n> Na\n+\n> K\n+\n). The kinetics associated with the nucleophilic attack of water on oxidized electrophilic species decreases with increasing solvation strength\n\n. Because the cation effect is related to interaction of the cation with active oxygenated species, the oxidation behaviour of Aza-CMP-Co was studied by LSV in 1.0 M MOH (M, Li, Na and K) and 0.5 M MBi solutions. As shown in \n, for OER in borate buffers, activity decreased between alkaline cations K\n+\nand Li\n+\n, indicating the significant influence of the hydrogen bond network and solvation strength in a solution APT process. However, the catalytic performance of Aza-CMP-Co under alkaline pH is independent of cationic species \nand Supplementary \n). \nlists the kinetic features of Aza-CMP-Co under near-neutral and alkaline conditions. In addition to catalytic performance, many differences in catalytic kinetics were observed under different pH conditions (the OER mechanism under alkaline conditions is clarified in Supplementary Note\n\n). Specifically, OER activities of Aza-CMP-Co clearly show dependency on anion concentration and cation species under near-neutral conditions, indicating that a solution APT process is the RDS. Under alkaline conditions, Co(OH)\n\n—as reference material—is fully in line with the estimated behaviours in a solution APT process (Supplementary Note\n\n). However, OER catalysed by Aza-CMP-Co exhibits completely different characteristics from the solution APT process under alkaline conditions: no such dependencies were observed, which means that the RDS is not influenced by an additional proton acceptor and varying solvation strength. The absence of KIEs for Aza-CMP-Co under alkaline conditions suggests that direct O-H bond cleavage is not involved in the RDS. Logically, increased anion concentration cannot accelerate OER because the proton transfer process is not involved in the RDS. If not directly from H\n\nO/OH\n–\nmolecules in the inner Helmholtz plane, then the O atom for O-O bond formation possibly originates from the adjacent pre-deprotonated H\n\nO molecules (OH ligand) generated by the decoupled 2H\n+\n/1e\n−\nCo\n2+/3+\nredox. Therefore, the absence of solvation strength dependency under alkaline conditions is caused by the intramolecular hydroxyl transfer process in RDS \n). The combination of redox properties, absence of kinetic isotope effect (H/D), added anion and cation effect under basic conditions provides sufficient evidence that the intramolecular O-O bond formation pathway of Aza-CMP-Co is the RDS under alkaline catalytic conditions.\n\n–\nd\n, LSV curves of Aza-CMP-Co as a function of [NaBi] at pH 13.3 (\nb\n), pH 11.0 (\nc\n) and pH 7.7 (\nd\n); inset: corresponding reaction order of [Bi] at pH 13.3, 11.0 and 7.7 (scan rate, 5 mV s\n−1\n).\ne\n, LSV curves of Aza-CMP-Co in 1.0 M KOH, NaOH and LiOH; inset, comparison of catalytic current at different potentials (scan rate, 5 mV s\n−1\n).\nf\n, LSV curves of Aza-CMP-Co in 0.5 M KBi, NaBi and LiBi; inset, comparison of catalytic current at different potentials (scan rate, 5 mV s\n−1\n).\ng\n, Comparison of kinetic phenomena and effects under different conditions.\nFull size image\nThe OER is a sluggish reaction involving four-electron/proton transfer steps and multiple intermediates. The RDS of OER is often not definitive, because of experimental difficulties in establishing the operational reaction mechanism. Activation energy is dependent only on the intrinsic properties of the reaction pathway for a given catalyst. Therefore, to gain insights into intrinsic OER activity and explore the differences in cobalt sites in both alkaline and near-neutral OER catalysis, activation energy was measured in both NaOH and NaBi buffer solutions through temperature-controlled electrocatalysis (Supplementary Note\n\n). As shown in ,c\n, the OER activities of Aza-CMP-Co exhibit an exact temperature-dependent feature in both NaOH and NaBi solutions. The corresponding Arrhenius plots of the natural logarithm of current at various potentials (ln\ni\n) against 1/T were calculated and are illustrated in ,d\n. Activation energy\nW\nwas plotted against the overpotential, and the linear relationship is shown in \n, which verifies the speculation in Supplementary Equation\n\n. The value of\nW\nunder alkaline conditions (\nW\nalkaline\n) is significantly lower than that under near-neutral conditions (\nW\nneutral\n); in the OER catalytic overpotential range of 0.3–0.5 V, the difference between\nW\nalkaline\nand\nW\nneutral\nat a specific overpotential (Δ\nW\n) changed linearly, from 4.45 to 0.96 kcal mol\n−1\n, suggesting a TOF gap of 10\n\n- to 10\n\n-fold at different reaction overpotentials. Because activation energy is independent of extrinsic factors, the observed difference in\nW\nindicates different RDS intermediate states, which could lead to substantial differences in intrinsic performance.\n\n, Temperature-dependent LSV curves (\na\n) and corresponding Arrhenius plots (\nb\n) of Aza-CMP-Co-catalysed OER at different overpotentials under alkaline conditions (1.0 M NaOH; scan rate, 5 mV s\n−1\n).\nc\n,\nd\n, Temperature-dependent LSV curves (\nc\n) and corresponding Arrhenius plots (\nd\n) of Aza-CMP-Co-catalysed OER at different overpotentials under near-neutral conditions (pH 9.0 NaBi buffer; scan rate, 5 mV s\n−1\n).\ne\n, Plots of overpotential-dependent activation energy (\nW\n) against reaction overpotential.\nf\n, Calculated energy profiles of WNA (blue) and IHNA (red) pathways.

The endergonic reaction requires reaction and activation energies of 8.2 and 24.6 kcal mol\n−1\n, respectively (transition state 1, TS-1; \nand Supplementary \n). The proton generated from WNA is transferred to OH, forming [Co\n2+\n-OOH(OH)(OH\n\n)\n\n] (intermediate 6; \nand Supplementary \n). By contrast, O-O bond formation via IHNA from [Co\n4+\n=O(OH)\n\n(OH\n\n)]\nQ\n(intermediate 5; \n) is more favourable under basic conditions than that via WNA. The corresponding transition states are shown in \nand Supplementary \n(transition state 2, TS-2), in which the O-O distance is 1.77 Å. In this pathway the O-O bond formation step is favourable, with reaction energy and activation energies of −1.8 and 21.5 kcal mol\n−1\n, respectively. A similar OH\n−\nnucleophilic attack of the highly oxidized metal centre is reported under basic conditions\n\n,\n\n. Here, the computed activation energy difference for the two reaction pathways is 3.1 kcal mol\n−1\n, which agrees well with the experimental Δ\nW\nvalues obtained at reaction overpotential between 0.32 V (4.1 kcal mol\n−1\n) and 0.45 V (2.1 kcal mol\n−1\n). Compared with results obtained under neutral conditions, experimental and calculation results for the cobalt sites in alkaline electrolytes demonstrated lower activation energies, different pH-dependent redox features, lower KIEs, negligible reaction order with respect to the external anion and absence of cation effects \n). Based on these results, the key to understanding the wide performance gap between catalysed OER performances in alkaline and near-neutral electrolytes is the p\nK\na\n-induced, pH-related, nucleophilic attack pathway.\nCobalt-based materials can function as effective electrocatalysts under strongly alkaline conditions\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, while the electrochemical oxidation activity of cobalt-based materials drops drastically under neutral pH conditions. To date, most catalysts have required large overpotentials, ranging from 400 to 600 mV, to reach dominant catalytic current densities under neutral pH\n\n. For further application of cobalt-based catalysts as components for solar fuel utilization, an improvement in water oxidation activity and understanding of water oxidation mechanisms, particularly under neutral conditions, is essential. Although a few studies have investigated the mechanisms of water oxidation for cobalt catalysts\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, the mechanism behind the sharp decline in catalytic performance of cobalt-based catalysts under neutral conditions remains unclear. After determination of nucleophilic attack pathways for O-O bond formation by experimental observations and calculations, catalytic cycles that included four PCET processes were proposed for cobalt sites catalysing the OER \n). Deprotonation occurs during the conversion of Co\n2+\nto Co\n3+\n, and two protons detach when pH is increased above the p\nK\na\nvalue of the Co\n3+\ncomplex. According to the Pourbaix diagram, one OH\n−\nligand is deprotonated when Co\n3+\nis further oxidized to Co\n4+\n, forming a Co\n4+\n=O fragment under both near-neutral and alkaline conditions. When reactions are conducted in a buffered medium, the anionic component of the buffer may serve as a proton acceptor in the solution APT mechanism. In the basic pH range, concerted proton–electron oxidations involve OH\n−\nas a proton acceptor occur\n\n. A minimum of two successive redox processes was observed after Co\n3+\n/Co\n4+\npotential in a non-aqueous solution, and these redox features immediately diminished when OER occurred. Therefore, RDS step 3 is the O-O bond formation process that involves a concerted solution APT process with the formation of a Co-OOH fragment under near-neutral conditions, which results in a normal KIE\nH/D\nand pH-independent OER activity on the RHE scale. However, O-O formation mechanisms differ significantly at different pH values, as demonstrated by the experimental evidence and calculation results. Owing to the formation of extra -OH groups during the non-concerted PCET process of Co\n2+\n/Co\n3+\nin alkaline electrolytes, the Co-OOH fragment tends to be generated via an intramolecular hydroxyl nucleophilic attack pathway where the adjacent -OH attacks the oxo ligand in Co\n4+\n=O to form an intramolecular O-O bond, yielding a secondary KIE\nH/D\nand pH-independent OER activity on the RHE scale. This pathway requires a significantly lower activation energy than that of intermolecular WNA under neutral conditions. Finally, the -OOH ligand transforms into dioxygen after a further 1H\n+\n/1e\n−\nPCET process and O\n\nis released with substrate reattachment to complete the catalytic cycle. Therefore, the intermolecular WNA pathway, which has higher apparent activation energy compared with the IHNA pathway, predominates under neutral conditions and hampers rapid OER kinetics.\n\n) and IHNA (\nb\n); under the basic pH range, the non-concerted PCET process in Co\n2+/3+\nredox facilitates the IHNA pathway.\nFull size image\nConclusions\nIn summary, single-site cobalt ions anchored on Aza-CMP served as active centres for OER. The resultant Aza-CMP-Co was highly efficient in catalysis of OER under both neutral and alkaline conditions, resulting in higher TOFs than those of state-of-the-art, material-based catalysts. Experimental and theoretical results based on this model catalyst, with well-defined catalytic single-site cobalt decoration, demonstrated that OER catalysed by a single cobalt site triggered a pH-controlled nucleophilic attack pathway. This transition of O-O bond formation pathways was controlled by PCET features of the pre-redox states—that is, p\nK\na\nof the Co\n3+\nintermediates. When the pH is higher than the p\nK\na\nvalue, electrochemically driven deprotonation results in the transport of an additional proton, which facilitates the IHNA pathway where the adjacent OH\n−\nattacks Co\n4+\n=O to form the O-O bond. As established through temperature-controlled experiments and DFT calculations, the IHNA pathway requires much lower activation energy compared with that of the intermolecular WNA pathway, further clarifying the origin of the significant performance loss in terms of overpotential, Tafel slopes and TOFs when the alkaline electrolyte is changed to a neutral electrolyte. The proposed facile strategy of fabricating heterogeneous molecular electrocatalysts and the series of OER kinetic studies, including pH-dependent effects, kinetic isotope effects, APT studies, quantitative cyclic voltammetry analysis, electrochemical activation energy measurements and theoretical calculations, can be extended to various transition-metal ions, unlocking opportunities for the investigation of heterogeneous molecular electrocatalytic systems.\n\nMethods\nChemicals\nAll reagents and solvents were used as received from commercial sources, unless otherwise noted. 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride (technical grade), cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (≥99%) and anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, >99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Cobalt(II) hydroxide (99.9%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. High-purity water (18.2 MΩ cm\n−1\n), supplied with a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Direct 8), was used in all experiments. CP substrate was purchased from a local company; prior to use, CP was sequentially ultrasonically cleaned in concentrated nitric acid, deionized water, ethanol and acetone for 20 min. All other reagents were commercially available and used as received. Organic solvents were of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification.\n\nSynthesis of Aza-CMP\nA total of 532.5 mg (1.875 mmol) of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine tetrahydrochloride in 15 ml of anhydrous DMF and 390 mg (1.25 mmol) of hexaketocyclohexane octahydrate in 5 ml of anhydrous DMF were mixed and refluxed for 48 h under Ar. The resulting dark-brown solid was purified via hot extraction with methanol for 48 h using a Soxhlet extractor, then dried under vacuum at 150 °C for 24 h. Protonation-assisted exfoliation of the as-prepared bulk polymer was performed according to the reported literature\n\n. To summarize, Aza-CMP (100 mg) was dispersed in 100 ml of 12 M HCl, and the suspension was subjected to ultrasonication for 24 h. The mixture was diluted with deionized water and centrifuged at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 min to separate large aggregates. Exfoliated nanosheets were collected by filter (polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 45 μm) and washed thoroughly with water.\n\nSynthesis of Aza-CMP-Co\nAza-CMP material was modified with Co\n2+\nusing cobalt(II) acetate. Aza-CMP (20 mg) was immersed in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF and the suspension stirred for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere, with the gas bubbling through the solution. Next, 85 mg (1.5 eq. with respect to phenanthroline units) of cobalt(II) acetate was dissolved in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF under Ar. The Co solution was slowly added to the suspension under Ar, and the mixture was maintained in a dispersed state by ultrasonication for 8 h at room temperature. The solid was filtered and then washed with DMF, water, methanol and ethanol until the filtrate became colourless. Finally, the product was dried at 80 °C under vacuum conditions. Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) was fabricated via the same procedure while replacing the as-prepared bulk Aza-CMP with exfoliated Aza-CMP.\n\nPhysical characterization methods\nAtomic force microscope techniques were performed in dynamic mode using a Cypher ES system operating at room temperature under ambient air conditions. A commercial Oxford probe (no. HQ-150-Au) was used with a nominal force constant of 8 N m\n−1\n. The surfaces used for AFM experiments were SiO\n\n/Si. AFM images were processed using Gwyddion software. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) experiments were carried out using a low-temperature qPlus-equipped commercial Omicron LT-STM (Omcron LT-STM QPlus pre4) at 4.2 K. As-synthesized Aza-CMP was deposited on the pre-cleaned Au substrate by in situ thermal evaporation under ultra-high vacuum condition. The STM image was obtained at a sample bias of 0.2 V and a tunnelling current of 50 pA. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K with a Micromeritics 3Flex adsorption analyser. Samples were degassed in a vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method was applied to calculate specific surface areas. The NLDFT models were used to determine the porosity of samples in SAIEUS software. XRD studies were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance Power X-Ray Diffractometer (Cu–Kα radiation,\nλ\n= 1.5418 Å). The morphology and composition of the fabricated films were characterized using a Hitachi field-emission scanning electron microscope (Regulus 8230) and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector (Oxford Ultim EXTREME). HAADF–STEM images and EDX mapping were collected on a JEM ARM-200F and FEI Talos F200X field-emission transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Surface composition of electrode films was investigated using XPS on an ESCALAB Xi\n+\n(Thermo Scientific). Raman spectroscopy was measured using a DXR Microscope (Thermo Fisher) and FT–IR with a Nicolet 6700 Flex (Thermo Fisher). High-resolution, solid-state NMR (SS-NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer at Larmor frequency of 125.7 MHz using a 4 mm broadband cross-polarization magic angle-spinning (MAS) probe head. Alanine was used as an external reference (178 ppm)\n\n. The MAS sample spinning rate was 8 kHz. Cross-polarization was applied at a contact pulse duration of 1 ms and recycle delay of 5 s. A total of 2,740 transients were needed for a good signal-to-noise ratio. The concentration of Co was measured using ICP–OES with a Thermo Scientific iCAP 6000 series instrument. Samples on electrodes were digested in 1 ml of aqua regia with ultrasonication in a closed vessel and then diluted ten times to make a sample solution. Co standard solutions were measured prior to sampling, to calibrate and obtain standard curves. Co concentrations were determined using four different wavelengths: 231.1, 235.3, 237.8 and 238.8 nm, with average concentrations obtained at different wavelengths taken for data evaluation. Faraday efficiency measurements were carried out with an Omega PXM409 pressure transducer and a laboratory-made H-cell. EXAFS measurements were carried out on samples at beamline 07A1 of Taiwan Light Source at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center. This beamline adopts a fixed-exit, double-crystal Si monochromator to provide X-ray energy in the range 5–23 keV. The end-station was equipped with three ionization chambers and a Lytle detector for transmission and fluorescence-mode X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The beam size of the X-ray used on samples was ~0.5 × 0.25 mm (H × V), with flux >1 × 1,010 photons s\n−1\n. XAFS Co K-edge readings were collected at this beamline. Data were collected in fluorescence mode using a Lytle detector, while the corresponding reference sample was collected in transmission mode. Samples were ground and uniformly daubed on special adhesive tape. Raw EXAFS data were analysed according to standard procedures with ATHENA software packages. Quantitative curve fittings were carried out in R space (1.0–3.0 Å) with a FT K-space range of 2.5–12 Å\n−1\nusing the module ARTEMIS from IFEFFIT. The amplitude reduction factor (\nS\n\n) was fixed at 0.9. Energy shift (Δ\nE\n\n) was constrained to be the same for all scatter. Path length\nR\n, coordination number\nN\nand Debye–Waller factor\nσ\n\nwere left as free parameters.\n\nPreparation of catalyst inks and film on the electrode\nThe catalyst was dispersed in a water/ethanol 1:1 solution to form an ink, which was prepared by immersion of 5 mg of catalyst in a solution containing 0.25 ml each of water and ethanol. The catalyst ink was transferred to an ultrasonic bath and sonicated for 60 min, then 10 μl of the ink was deposited onto the CP electrode (5 × 5 mm\n\n). For drying of ink droplets, the electrode was kept under an Ar atmosphere until the film was completely dry."

After aging, cooled it to room\ntemperature and washed with deionized water to pH=7, followed by drying in an oven at 80 °C\novernight. Finally, it was ground into powder and calcined in a muffle furnace at 2 °C/min to 350 °C\nfor 5 h.

Before the\nimpregnation experiment, the nano-ZrO (Aladdin 99.8%, mentals basis) and nano-SiO (Aladdin\n2 2\n99.99%, mentals basis) supports should be dried overnight in an oven to remove internal moisture.\nFirst, weighed the Cu(NO ) ·3H O (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%-103%) precursor according to the metal\n3 2 2\nloading and dissolved it in 4 mL of deionized water to form a solution, and then added to 4 g carrier\ndropwise with constant stirring. After the addition was completed, the solution was dispersed\nultrasonically for 1 hour. Finally, stirred and evaporated it to dryness, ground into a powder, and\ncalcined at 500 °C for 5 h."

Well-defined\ncobalt nanoparticles were synthesized by wet impregnation of the support with an aqueous\nsolution of the hexaamminecobalt (III) complex [Co(NH ) ]3+ in a strong electrostatic\n3 6\nadsorption mode. Preparative aspects have been published earlier14. The size and size\ndistribution of the Co O particles in all calcined CoCZ catalysts were similar as can be\n3 4\nappreciated from Supplementary \nzirconia. STEM-EDX images of the 1% CoCZ sample revealed that this sample contains mainly\nsmaller particles of about 3 nm (Supplementary and the bright-field TEM leads to\noverestimation of the particle size. These small particles have a flat shape (Supplementary\nFigures 5,6), which is usually associated with enhanced metal-support interaction (MSI)54–56.\nSupplementary \nnm).\nSupplementary \nFTIR\nCO adsorption at -170 °C was used to probe the surface of Co O .

Using the Scherrer equation, the\n3 4\ncrystallite size of cobalt oxide was estimated to be ~8.8 nm, ~9.6 nm and ~12.8 nm for 5%,\n10% and 20% CoCZ samples, respectively. For 1% and 2.5% CoCZ catalysts, the diffraction\npeaks of Co O could not be resolved, indicating that the particles were either too small or\n3 4\namorphous in nature. These results and the metal loadings as determined by elemental analysis\nare listed in Supplementary \ninhomogeneity of the system, e.g., the presence of slightly Ce-rich (or Zr-rich) solid solutions.\nPhase separation to CeO and ZrO was not observed for these CoCZ systems.\n2 2\n\nCoCZ catalysts reduced at different temperatures\nIn order to study the particle size distribution of 1% and 10% CoCZ after reduction, the samples\nwere reduced in a plug flow reactor and placed in an in situ TEM holder in a glovebox, followed\nby transfer into the TEM apparatus without exposure to air. Reduced samples exhibited\nenhanced contrast between cobalt and the support due to the presence of metallic cobalt.\n1Co300 offered only a low contrast, likely due to the low degree of reduction. 1% and 10%\nCoCZ show a very low degree of sintering, even after 500 °C pretreatment in a hydrogen\natmosphere (Supplementary . We relate the high sintering resistance of these CoCZ\nsystems to strong MSI.\nSupplementary \ncatalysts (Supplementary .\nSupplementary \nreduction temperature for samples with Co loading of 1 – 10% points at the increase of the\n\ncobalt particle size in the reduced catalysts. The particle size derived from CO chemisorption\nfor 1% and 10% CoCZ reduced at different temperatures is in reasonable agreement with the\nEDX-STEM and STEM measurements (Supplementary and 11). The catalyst with\na metal loading of 20% displayed significant sintering of the cobalt nanoparticles.

The\n\nreduction of cobalt catalysts involves well-separated features at 280 °C and 550 °C. Bulk Co O\n3 4\nreduction usually involves two steps, i.e. Co O → CoO → Co. The reduction of supported\n3 4\ncobalt nanoparticles typically occurs between 300 °C and 400 °C. The higher reduction\ntemperature observed for CoCZ is related to strong cobalt-support interactions32. The reduction\nfeature at 400 °C for CoCZ samples corresponds to the reduction of bulk Ce4+ to Ce3+, which\nwas reported earlier for samples prepared by hexamminecobalt (III) acetate synthesis14. The\nbare support can be reduced only at a significantly higher temperature of ~600 °C. As the peak\narea of the medium-temperature feature remains constant, the reduction degree of support is\nlikely similar for all catalysts. The similarity of the various TPR profiles also indicates that the\nnature of metal-support interactions is independent of the cobalt loading.\n\nSupplementary \nCoO reduction becomes easier with increasing cobalt loading. The CoO phase is stabilized in a\nsignificantly broader temperature range in the 2.5% CoCZ sample. Unfortunately, the high-\ntemperature transmission cell did not allow us to measure 1% CoCZ due to the strong\nabsorption of ceria-zirconia in the energy range used to probe Co K-edge XANES.\n\nSupplementary Note 3. Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI)\nCoCZ catalysts reduced at different temperature\nA number of studies reported structure-sensitivity for cobalt and nickel on relatively inert\nsupports such as carbon nanofibers7,13, silica8 and alumina57 or for unsupported cobalt NPs36.\nIn the present study, we report the performance of cobalt nanoparticles of different size located\non a reducible ceria-zirconia support. The results in Supplementary Note 2 emphasize that the\nnature of the metal-support interactions is independent of the cobalt loading. An alternative\nexplanation for the influence of the reduction temperature effects can be strong metal-support\ninteractions (SMSI), which can lead to the decoration of cobalt nanoparticles by a layer of\nsupport material. This adverse effect of SMSI usually increases at higher reduction temperature.\nTo attribute the observed size-performance relations to structure sensitivity rather than to SMSI,\nwe need to rule out such decoration/encapsulation effects of cobalt nanoparticles by the ceria-\nzirconia supports.\nCO chemisorption (Supplementary shows that CO is predominantly irreversibly\nadsorbed on cobalt (as judged from the difference between the 1st and 2nd isotherm) for all\ncatalysts. As there is no suppression of CO adsorption with increasing reduction temperature,\nwe can exclude encapsulation of cobalt nanoparticles due to SMSI after high-temperature\nreduction25. Suppression of (irreversible) CO adsorption by SMSI is typical for reducible\nsupports58 and confirmed as a reference here for Co/TiO after reduction at 400 °C\n\n(Supplementary and Supplementary .\n\nSupplementary \ndifferent temperatures.\n\nSupplementary \n\nd, nm ads, µmol/g\n300 12.8 72.7\n400 15.3 61.0\n500 41.1 22.6\nSupplementary \nAll the calcined CoCZ catalysts have similar UV-Vis spectra with two characteristic broad\nbands located in the 400 – 480 and 700 – 760 nm regions, which can be attributed to cobalt (III)\noxide (Supplementary .

No obvious differences in cobalt- and\n3 4\nceria-zirconia-related bands were observed between as-prepared 1% CoCZ and its counterpart\nafter reductive pretreatment at different temperatures (Supplementary . This\nimplies that reduction did not lead to cobalt doping of the CZ solid solution60.

The catalyst suspensions (10 mg/2.0 ml water) were diluted with degassed water at a ratio of 1/50 and 1/10 (shown in the inset) for the measurement.\nFull size image\nWhen Pd/CsPMA was exposed to a flow of forming gas (5% H\n\nin molecular nitrogen (N\n\n)) at room temperature (24 °C), a rapid colour change from yellow to dark blue was observed within twenty minutes. The in situ H\n\n-DRIFTS spectrum of Pd/CsPMA presents a notable peak at >3200 cm\n−1\nfor Pd/CsPMA (Supplementary \n), indicating the formation of a large amount of surface hydroxyl groups (–OH), which is not the case for CsPMA. This implies that Pd plays a crucial role in dissociating H\n\ninto hydrogen atoms and transferring hydrogen species from the noble metal sites to the support\n\n,\n\n. The hydrogen atoms donate electrons to PMA and combine with PMA oxygen atoms to form hydroxyl groups on the surface. In situ NO-DRIFTS analysis confirms that the Pd species remain highly dispersed during H\n\ntreatment at room temperature (Supplementary \n). We then prepared the Pd/CsPMA-H material, by treating the unactivated Pd/CsPMA catalyst under H\n\n(4 bar) in water for 15 min. As shown in \n, the colour of the catalyst also changed from yellow (Pd/CsPMA) to dark blue (Pd/CsPMA-H). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible) adsorption spectra of the Pd/CsPMA-H suspension showed a clear decrease in the Mo(VI) signal at 320–340 nm \n) and an increase in Mo(V) and Mo(IV) in the range of 600–900 nm \ninset), illustrating the reduction of Mo by hydrogen spillover\n\n,\n\n. As determined via redox titration using acidified FeCl\n\nsolution (Supplementary \n), each POM anion, on average, accepts 8.4 electrons after 15 min of H\n\ntreatment, corroborating the UV-visible adsorption data that Mo(VI) was only partially reduced. Additional H\n\ntreatment does not increase the degree of hydrogen spillover.\nThe reduced Pd/CsPMA-H powder is readily re-oxidized when exposed to air at room temperature (represented as Pd/CsPMA-H-O), as judged from the recovered yellowish colour and the UV-visible absorption results ,h\n). This highlights that the reduced Pd/CsPMA catalyst can activate O\n\nat ambient temperature. Pd/CsPMA-H-O exhibits a similar morphology and crystalline structure as well as characteristic POM anion Raman peaks to those of pristine Pd/CsPMA (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand ,c\n), which prove that the repeated reduction–oxidation steps do not change the structure of Pd/CsPMA, thus hinting at its potential as a catalyst in redox reactions.\nCatalytic performance in partial methane oxidation\nThe methane oxidation reaction was carried out at room temperature in an aqueous solution with methane and O\n\n(\n). The unactivated Pd/CsPMA catalyst exhibited negligible methane conversion activity \n, entry 1), and after the reaction the yellow colour of Pd/CsPMA was maintained, indicating an unchanged oxidative state of Mo (Supplementary \n). To validate that adding electrons to the catalyst is conducive to the aerobic oxidation of methane, Pd/CsPMA was first treated with H\n\nin the liquid phase at room temperature to form the reduced catalyst Pd/CsPMA-H. When Pd/CsPMA-H was used for methane oxidation with O\n\nunder identical conditions for 30 min, we observed the conversion of methane with methanol as the sole product (5.2 μmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n; \n, entry 2). Shortening the reaction to 5 min provided a proportionally increased methanol production rate (28.8 μmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n), suggesting that Pd/CsPMA-H is only active in the initial stage of the reaction \n, entry 3). By adjusting the partial pressures of methane and O\n\n, it was possible to improve the methanol productivity, with this metric rising to 67.4 μmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n\n, entry 4). The colour of the spent catalyst changed to greenish yellow, suggesting that it was re-oxidized by O\n\nduring the course of the reaction (Supplementary \n). These results highlight two important findings. First, the H\n\n-reduced Pd/CsPMA catalyst selectively transforms methane and O\n\ninto methanol at room temperature. Second, Pd/CsPMA-H does not maintain its reduced state under an oxidizing atmosphere, and thus quickly loses its initial activity. To quantitatively establish the relationship between the degree of reduction of Pd/CsPMA and the methane oxidation activity, we performed H\n\ntreatments with varying durations and H\n\npressures to produce reduced Pd/CsPMA samples with different degrees of reduction. These samples were then used for methane oxidation tests (CH\n\n(10 bar), O\n\n(0.3 bar), N\n\n(2.7 bar), 15 min reaction). The performance data indicate that a minimum reduction of five electrons per PMA molecule is necessary for Pd/CsPMA to be active (Supplementary \n). Concurrently, we observed a sigmoid-like relationship between the accumulated methanol productivity and the initial degree of reduction, with a prominent increase in methanol yield for PMA samples pre-reduced with five or six electrons. Although each PMA molecule can be reduced by approximately nine electrons using H\n\n, further reduction with an electron number greater than seven does not lead to an increase in the methanol yield.\n Oxidation of methane to methanol using the Pd/CsPMA catalyst\nFull size table\nDespite the encouraging outcomes, the oxidative atmosphere results in the rapid deactivation of active sites, which leads to a low ratio between the methanol produced (0.02 μmol) and the exposed PMA (0.55 μmol), of roughly 4%. To sustain a reduced catalyst state, we then carried out the methane oxidation reaction using a non-explosive gas mixture of H\n\n, O\n\n, methane and N\n\nso that H\n\npretreatment was no longer applied. Under an optimized H\n\n/O\n\nratio, Pd/CsPMA presents a methanol productivity of 28.5 μmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n(corresponding to a noble metal specific productivity of 12.4 mmol g\nPd\n−1\nh\n−1\n), again with methanol as the only liquid product detected together with negligible gas-phase product in a 30 min reaction \n, entry 5). The activity and selectivity compare favourably with most reported noble-metal-containing catalysts for the thermal aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature (Supplementary \n). Interestingly, we observed that, in a typical 30 min reaction, the reaction proceeds at a higher rate during the second 15 min compared with the first, probably due to an induction period required to form the reduced catalyst that is active for methane oxidation (Supplementary \n). The H\n\n/CH\n\nratio remained almost constant during the reaction, suggesting that H\n\nis not preferentially consumed by O\n\ncompared with methane (Supplementary \n).\nThe production of methanol did not show any further increase when the reaction time was extended from 30 to 60 min, probably due to the over-reduction of the catalyst (>7.5–8 electrons per PMA; Supplementary \n). To maintain the catalyst activity for a longer duration, Pd/CsPMA was first partially reduced with H\n\nand then exposed to a mixture of methane, H\n\nand O\n\n, with the H\n\n/O\n\nratio adjusted to stabilize the PMA at around a six-electron reduced state (Supplementary \n). To our delight, methane was oxidized continuously to organic oxygenates for 8 h, resulting in a total methanol yield of 1.45 μmol and formic acid as the secondary product \n, entry 6).\nXiao and colleagues previously reported\n\nthe selective oxidation of methane with H\n\nand O\n\nusing AuPd alloy nanoparticles confined in a zeolite support. In that case, H\n\nO\n\nwas produced locally, which then acted as the oxidant for methane oxidation. By contrast, H\n\nO\n\nis unlikely to be the key oxidant in our system since no H\n\nO\n\nwas detected when supplying a mixture of H\n\nand O\n\nover the catalyst (detection limit, 0.5 ppm; Supplementary \n). In addition, when external H\n\nO\n\nwas added, no methanol was detected after 30 min despite 54% of the H\n\nO\n\nbeing decomposed \n, entry 7, and Supplementary \n). Methanol was produced only when H\n\nO\n\nwas used together with H\n\n(Supplementary \n), although the best activity (that is, 14.4 μmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n) was still not as high as the case when H\n\nand O\n\nare supplied. Molecular oxygen works better as an oxidant than H\n\nO\n\nin our case, possibly because, as a weaker oxidant, O\n\nenables the catalyst to maintain the desired reduced state under H\n\n.\nMethane oxidation was carried out under various partial pressures (\nP\n) of methane, H\n\nand O\n\n. The reaction is first order with respect to methane in the range of 0–15 bar \n), indicating that methane activation participates in the rate-determining step. By contrast, the methanol yield as a function of the H\n\n/O\n\nratio follows a volcano-type curve, with the optimal pressure of H\n\nbeing 4 bar and that of O\n\nat 0.3 bar \n). A threshold H\n\npartial pressure of 2 bar must be reached to create a state with a sufficient degree of Mo reduction for C–H bond activation. When O\n\nwas eliminated from the reaction system, only a trace amount of methanol was detected (2.0 μmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n), probably due to the residual O\n\nin water.\n\n(4 bar), O\n\n(0.3 bar), CH\n\n(10 bar) balanced with N\n\n(25.7 bar), room temperature, 30 min.\na\n, Methanol productivity under various methane partial pressures using Pd/CsPMA.\nr\n\n, coefficient of determination.\nb\n, Methanol productivity under various partial pressures of H\n\nand O\n\n.\nc\n, Methanol productivity for different POM-based catalysts. The loading of noble metals on the supported catalysts is around 0.25 wt%. The insets label the states of the catalysts during the reaction.

BzM dissolved in ethanol was added into the reaction mixture before (left bar) or after (right bar) H\n\ntreatment (BzM:Pd = 2:1). For the control experiment without BzM (middle bar), the same amount of ethanol solvent was added after H\n\npretreatment before methane conversion.\nf\n, Recyclability testing of Pd/CsPMA for methane oxidation with O\n\nand H\n\n(reaction conditions: H\n\n(2 bar), O\n\n(0.3 bar), CH\n\n(10 bar), 30 min).\nFull size image\nSeveral control catalyst samples were studied to confirm the critical role of reduced Mo species as catalytically active sites. CsPMA, Rh/CsPMA and Pt/CsPMA, which showed no reduction of PMA by H\n\nat room temperature, exhibited no methanol productivity \n). Rh/CsPMA and Pt/CsPMA were then pretreated with H\n\nat elevated temperature (50 °C and 100 °C, respectively). After the pretreatment, both catalysts turned dark blue, signalling Mo reduction, and in the following step both catalysts produced methanol from methane and O\n\nat room temperature (Supplementary \n). When PMA was replaced with phosphotungstate (PTA), Pd/CsPTA also did not show any methane activation under the same conditions \nand Supplementary \n). Furthermore, Rb\n+\nand NH\n\n+\nwere also used to precipitate PMA alongside Cs\n+\n, giving Pd/RbPMA and Pd/NPMA, respectively. The as-formed Pd/RbPMA and Pd/NPMA, after H\n\nreduction, presented similar methanol productivity values to Pd/CsPMA. This suggests that the cations in the catalysts do not largely affect the methane activation performance (Supplementary \n). To explore whether or not our finding, that is, H\n\n-reduced Mo in Pd/CsPMA readily converts methane and O\n\nto methanol, is generalizable, 1 wt% Pd/MoO\n\n, 1 wt% Pd/WO\n\nand 10 wt% Pd/C were evaluated under our methane oxidation conditions \nand Supplementary \n). The H\n\n-pretreated 1 wt% Pd/MoO\n\n-H indeed exhibited a methanol productivity of 14.4 μmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\nfor a 5 min reaction, whereas the other two catalysts were inactive. Interestingly, MoO\n\n, with Mo(IV) as the only Mo species, showed no methane activation properties with O\n\n. The above results indicate that Pd can be substituted by other metals such as Pt or Rh to facilitate PMA reduction with H\n\n, and partially reduced Mo species are critical for methane activation with O\n\n.\nMethanol formation pathway on reduced PMA: experimental evidence\nSince the radical mechanism is one of the mainstream mechanisms to activate the methane C–H bond in aqueous solution, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline\nN\n-oxide radical trapping agent were carried out to determine the presence of reactive oxygen species (Supplementary \n)\n\n. The appearance of characteristic quadruple peaks (1:2:2:1) for an H\n\nO\n\naqueous solution indicates trapped HO\n•\nradicals, and triplet peaks was observed for an aqueous suspension of pristine Pd/CsPMA, probably coming from the oxidative dimerization of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (\n). However, these are the cases for which no methanol productivity was observed. By contrast, for the H\n\n-pretreated Pd/CsPMA-H catalyst, no similar signals were detected. To provide further evidence that HO\n•\nradicals do not operate in our system, methane oxidation reactions were carried out over the Pd/CsPMA-H catalyst in the presence of HO\n•\nradical scavengers (that is, ascorbic acid or Na\n\nS) \n, entries 8 and 9, respectively). For the reactions that included either ascorbic acid or Na\n\nS, the methanol productivity of the Pd/CsPMA-H catalyst did not decrease but instead increased to 42.2 and 48.0 μmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n, respectively, compared with 28.8 μmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\nwithout the scavengers. This suggests that methane is not activated by free HO\n•\nintermediates. The increased productivity may be ascribed to the elongated lifetime for reduced PMA species under O\n\n, due to the reductive nature of the scavengers.\nTo further rule out the role of Pd in C–H activation, selective poisoning tests were conducted by adding benzyl mercaptan (BzM). BzM binds strongly with Pd, thus preventing Pd–reactant interactions \nand Supplementary \n)\n\n. As expected, after introducing two equivalents of BzM (relative to Pd) to block Pd in Pd/CsPMA before H\n\ntreatment, PMA was unable to be reduced to enable methane oxidation (BzM-H\n\n-CH\n\n/O\n\nin \n). By contrast, when the same amount of BzM was added to pre-reduced Pd/CsPMA-H catalyst (H\n\n-BzM-CH\n\n/O\n\nin \n), the methanol productivity mimicked the performance without BzM (H\n\n-CH\n\n/O\n\nin \n). This experiment, together with the earlier presented fact that reduced Rh/CsPMA and Pt/CsPMA are also active in the oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature, provide compelling evidence that methane activation proceeds not on Pd sites but on reduced PMA.\n\n, Experimental (exp) and simulated (sim) EPR spectra of the Pd/CsPMA-H solid under N\n\n.

The highlighted region of 12.9–13.2 min indicates the retention time of methanol.\nFull size image\nThe reduced catalyst Pd/CsPMA-H has considerable solubility in water, probably due to the strong interaction between spilt H-induced surface hydroxyl groups and water molecules\n\n,\n\n. This provides an opportunity to determine whether methanol formation requires an extended surface or individual PMA anions. Hence, a H\n\n-reduced Pd/CsPMA-H aqueous suspension was separated via ultrafiltration centrifugation (nominal molecular weight limit, 10 kDa) and evaluated in methane oxidation. The resulting solution and solid residue were both found to offer activity (Supplementary \n), suggesting that H\n\n-reduced PMA provides the active sites for methane conversion, regardless of whether in solution or the solid phase.\nTo enable catalyst recycling, the spent reaction solution was first re-oxidized using O\n\n(1 bar) at room temperature, followed by the addition of the Cs\n+\nsalt as a precipitation agent. Over 99% of the Pd/CsPMA catalyst can be regenerated (Supplementary \n). A reductive atmosphere (H\n\n(2 bar), O\n\n(0.3 bar) and CH\n\n(10 bar) diluted with N\n\nto a total pressure of 40 bar) was used for the reaction sessions during successive recycling tests to ensure the sufficient activation of Mo in each cycle. No loss in methanol formation activity was observed over five successive reactions \n); furthermore, the recovered catalyst (after five cycles) exhibited an identical X-ray diffraction pattern to the fresh catalyst (Supplementary \n), indicating that the PMA structure remained intact during recycling.\nIn view of the important role of reduced PMA on methane activation, we investigated the coordination structure around Mo before and after hydrogen reduction via pseudo in situ EPR. As expected, no signal was detected for Pd/CsPMA before H\n\ntreatment since the Mo species exist predominantly as Mo(VI), which is EPR-inactive (Supplementary \n)\n\n. When measured under a H\n\natmosphere, Pd/CsPMA-H exhibits a broad, featureless EPR spectrum centred at a\ng\nvalue of approximately 1.93 \n), which can be ascribed to the emergence of Mo(V) species\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. The unresolved hyperfine splitting and the asymmetric lineshape, which almost resemble a broad isotropic line, point to a Mo(V) centre with six oxygen atoms at close bond lengths where free movement or rotation is relatively unhindered\n\n. Afterwards, the EPR tube containing Pd/CsPMA-H was vacuumized and purged with N\n\n(denoted as Pd/CsPMA-H\n\n-N\n\n). This treatment resulted in an anisotropic EPR spectrum with a much narrower lineshape and resolution of the splitting that arises from the hyperfine interaction of the unpaired electron in Mo(V) with the\n\nMo and\n\nMo nuclei, both with a nuclear spin of\nI\n= 5/2 and a combined natural abundance of 25.5%. This spectral change implies a large extent of anisotropic distortion of the MoO\nx\npolyhedra after reduction \n). The spectrum of the reduced sample was further fitted with\ng\nand\nA\neigenframes, which are considered collinear, on the basis of previous work and theoretical considerations\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Based on simulation results \n, Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n), the spectrum consists of the signals of three Mo(V) components, with the dominant one containing an oxygen vacancy on the bridge site of two MoO\nx\npolyhedra, signified as\nF\n(\ng\n⟂\n= 1.954–1.955,\ng\n∥\n= 1.857, weight = 62%) (Supplementary \n)\n\n,\n\n. The remaining signals originate from pentacoordinated Mo(V) without molybdenyl oxygen (structure\nC\n) and the hexacoordinated Mo(V) centre (structure\nA\n)\n\n,\n\n. Although the results cannot give information on EPR-silent, deep reduced Mo(IV) species, the insights about Mo(V) already provide knowledge on the largely weakened Mo–O bonds and the tendency for oxygen deficiency around Mo centres under the reduced state that may facilitate interactions with oxygen or methane molecules.\nWhen Pd/CsPMA-H was exposed to CH\n\nand then analysed via EPR \n, pink trace), the spectrum exhibited a similar pattern to Pd/CsPMA-H\n\n-N\n\n(light blue trace), which illustrates that the reduced Mo does not coordinate directly with methane molecules. However, when Pd/CsPMA-H was exposed to air, the EPR signals disappeared rapidly (purple and orange traces). Fully consistent with the EPR data, in situ Raman experiments reveal that Mo–O\nb\n–Mo and Mo–O\nc\n–Mo are substantially weakened by H\n\nreduction, which is recovered after treatment with O\n\n(Supplementary \n). On the basis of these results, we posit that the MoO\nx\nsites with oxygen vacancies first activate O\n\n, creating active surface oxygen to then enable C–H activation by abstracting a hydrogen atom from methane.\nTo confirm that O\n\nfills the as-formed oxygen vacancies, we designed isotope labelling experiments using\n\nO\n\nand H\n\nO for methane oxidation reactions \n). For the standard methanol solution (leftmost trace) and methanol produced from methane in the presence of H\n\nO and\n\nO\n\n(left-middle trace), two major peaks appear, at [CH\n\nO]\n+\n(mass-to-charge ratio (\nm\n/\nz\n) = 31) and [CH\n\nO]\n+\n(\nm\n/\nz\n= 29). When\n\nO\n\nwas used as the oxidant (right-middle trace), the two peaks shifted to\nm\n/\nz\n= 33 and\nm\n/\nz\n= 31, respectively, confirming that\n\nO-labelled methanol (CH\n\nOH) is the predominant product. In the case where H\n\nO was used to replace normal water as the solvent (rightmost trace), no increase in the\nm\n/\nz\nvalue was observed, indicating that oxygen in water is not the source of oxygen for methanol formation. These results demonstrate that the oxygen in the methanol product comes from O\n\n, consistent with our proposed mechanism in which O\n\nfills the oxygen vacancies and is then incorporated into methane to form methanol, accompanied by O–O dissociation.\nTheoretical insights into the formation of methanol over Pd/CsPMA-H\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to further verify the potential mechanisms for methane activation and methanol formation over the Pd/CsPMA-H catalyst \nand Supplementary \n). Considering that the donation of the electron by Cs is also similarly provided by spilled hydrogen and Cs\n+\ndoes not directly participate in methane activation, the Pd/PMA cluster (\nI\n) was constructed as the computational model. For the creation of active sites, calculations show that H\n\nactivation (\nII\n) occurs heterolytically over the Pd single-atom site with a relatively low barrier of 0.40 eV in terms of the enthalpy (\nH\n), resulting in a species with a hydroxyl group and PdH (intermediate\nIII\n). Subsequently, hydrogen spillover to two neighbouring oxygen sites is thermodynamically favourable (intermediate\nIV\n), followed by H\n\nO generation with a slightly higher barrier of 0.50 eV (intermediate\nV\n). On formation, the H\n\nO species remains adsorbed, bridging two Mo sites, and subsequently desorbs to the gas phase to create an oxygen vacancy that is energetically uphill by 0.81 eV in\nH\nbut 0.27 eV in terms of the Gibbs free energy (\nG\n) (intermediate\nVI\n). Bader charge extrapolation was carried out, with the results showing that the oxidation state of one of the Mo atoms adjacent to the bridge oxygen vacancy is EPR-active Mo(V), corresponding well with the EPR results (Supplementary \n). The lattice oxygen vacancy in the bridging oxygen site is unreactive towards methane but can readily adsorb O\n\nfrom the gas phase, with an adsorption energy of −0.14 eV and 0.46 eV in terms of\nH\nand\nG\n, respectively (intermediate\nVII\n). In this adsorbed state, one oxygen atom from O\n\nis situated in the lattice oxygen position, while the second oxygen extends away from the surface and does not chemically bond with it. The O–O bond length of the adsorbed species is also elongated from the DFT gas-phase length of 1.23 Å to 1.32 Å, suggesting that the O\n\nhas become highly activated and could be reactive to methane. In accordance with this expectation, C–H bond activation on the adsorbed O\n\noccurs with a barrier of 0.61 eV to form an O\n\nH species and a methyl radical (intermediates\nVIII\nand\nIX\n). Subsequently, the methyl radical can be captured by the same O\n\nH species via a rebound adsorption mechanism with a negligible barrier to form methanol, simultaneously cleaving the O–O bond and regenerating the lattice oxygen site (intermediate\nX\n). Considering the degree of reduction observed experimentally, we also mapped the reaction pathway with a POM containing eight adsorbed hydrogen species being reduced by eight electrons (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary Note\n\n). The profile shows that a reduced state of the POM favours H\n\nO desorption and O\n\nadsorption, that is, the formation of active sites, without noticeably elevating the C–H activation barrier, which explains the surge in the methane activation performance over a reduced POM.\n\n, The reaction intermediates (\na\n) and the reaction profiles for both the enthalpy (\nH\n) and the Gibbs free energy (\nG\n) (\nb\n). The reaction proceeds initially via H\n\nactivation and diffusion (intermediates\nI\n–\nIV\n), followed by vacancy formation and O\n\nadsorption (intermediates\nV\n–\nVII\n), then methane activation (intermediates\nVIII and IX\n) and methanol formation (intermediate\nX\n). Atom colour code: Mo, yellow; Pd, purple; O, red; C, dark grey; H, light grey. TS, transition state.\nSource data\nFull size image\nIn this mechanism, methane activation is enabled by the formation of activated O\n\nspecies that result from hydrogen spillover and vacancy formation. The rate-limiting step is C–H activation, in agreement with the experimentally observed first-order kinetics for methane. We also find that this mechanism agrees with the volcano-type curve for the H\n\n/O\n\nratio, as a balance must be struck to ensure the survival of the activated O\n\nspecies (intermediate\nVI\n). An overabundance of gaseous O\n\nwill react with hydroxyl groups and prevent vacancy formation, whereas an overabundance of H\n\nwill probably react with the adsorbed O\n\nbefore it can activate the methane. The mechanism was calculated on oxygen/vacancy sites that are non-adjacent to Pd, indicating that the presence of Pd was not required for methanol formation beyond the initial H\n\nactivation step, in accordance with the poisoning studies. Alternative mechanisms were also considered but were found to be unfavourable or inconsistent with experimental observations (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary Note\n\n).\nConclusions\nIn summary, we report a Pd-immobilized CsPMA catalyst with H\n\n-reduced Mo sites for the aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol, with the entire process operated at ambient temperature. Under the optimum conditions the catalyst achieved a methanol productivity of 29.3 mmol g\nPd\n−1\nh\n−1\nor 67.4 μmol g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\nwith nearly 100% selectivity at room temperature. Partially reduced Mo on PMA bears oxygen vacancies at the bridge sites, which readily activate O\n\nvia a refilling mechanism, creating active oxygen for hydrogen-atom abstraction from methane. Pd enables H\n\nactivation and PMA reduction, but does not participate in methane conversion. These findings provide a system for the selective synthesis of methanol from methane using O\n\nas the oxidant and H\n\nas the activating agent at ambient temperature, without the use of an external energy source (for example, light or electricity). From a mechanistic perspective, the Mo centre in its partially reduced state is found to be critical for an oxidation reaction to generate active oxygen species from O\n\n, which extends our understanding of typical catalytic oxidation processes.\n\nSample preparation\nPhosphomolybdic acid hydrate (PMA hydrate; H\n\nPMo\n\nO\n\n·\nx\nH\n\nO), phosphotungstic acid hydrate (PTA hydrate; H\n\nPW\n\nO\n\n·\nx\nH\n\nO), palladium(II) nitrate hydrate (Pd(NO\n\n)\n\n·\nx\nH\n\nO, ~40% Pd basis), rhodium(III) trinitrate hydrate (Rh(NO\n\n)\n\n·\nx\nH\n\nO, ~36% Rh basis), H\n\nO\n\n(35%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; anhydrous, ≥99.9%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Ir/NPG was prepared by the same procedure except for the weight of IrCl\n\n·\nx\nH\n\nO (37.5 mg).\nPt\n\n–P\n\n/NPG and Pt\n\n/NG were prepared by replacing IrCl\n\n·\nx\nH\n\nO with platinum(II) chloride (PtCl\n\n) that had the same weight of metal and following the same synthesis procedure as Ir\n–P\n\n/NPG and Ir\n\n/NG.\n\nCharacterization\nMorphological information was collected by field-emission SEM (JEOL JSM-6700F) and TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F). Specific surface area was measured based on a N\n\nadsorption–desorption method using a Micromeritics 3Flex analyser (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation) at 77 K. Sub-ångström-resolution HAADF-STEM characterization was performed on a JEM ARM200F STEM/TEM with a probe spherical aberration (\nCs\n) corrector working at 200 kV. For the HAADF imaging, a convergence angle of ~23 mrad and a collection angle range of 68–174 mrad were adapted for the incoherent atomic number imaging. Elemental analysis was studied on a microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyser (EX-230 100 m\n\ndetector). The crystal structure was examined by XRD (Bruker AXS D8 Advance) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with a LYNXEYE detector at 30 kV and 10 mA.\nThe mass contents of metals were quantified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (PerkinElmer) and ICP-MS (PerkinElmer). Detailed chemical compositions were examined by XPS on an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray beam (1,486.6 eV). During the quasi in situ XPS measurements, catalysts were first treated at OCV or 0.1 V (versus RHE) in a H\n\n-saturated electrolyte for 30 min. Then, the samples were transferred from the electrochemical system to the vacuum chamber of the spectrometer using a transfer bin under the protection of the Ar atmosphere in the glovebox. All the procedures were repeated at least three times in parallel to eliminate test errors. All binding energies were calibrated to the C 1\ns\npeak (284.6 eV) arising from the adventitious carbon-containing species. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy measurements including XANES and EXAFS of Ir L\n\n-edge were performed by employing a synchrotron radiation light source at the BL-12B2 beamline of the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JARSI) in SPring 8 (Japan), in which the electron storage ring was operated at 8.0 GeV and ambient conditions. Pt L\n\n-edge XAFS was measured in the total X-ray electron yield mode at room temperature using the BL-17C beamline at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC, Hsinchu, Taiwan), in which the electron storage ring was operated at 1.5 GeV with a beam current of 300 mA. Energy calibration was performed with an iridium or platinum foil standard by shifting all spectra to a glitch in the incident intensity. The EXAFS spectra were fitted using the FEFF 6.0 code.\nElectrochemical measurements\nAll electrochemical measurements were carried out at ambient temperature and pressure on a CHI 760e potentiostat. Glass cells were utilized in acidic media, while in alkaline media, all cell components were plastic to prevent contaminations such as from Fe leaching. To mitigate impurities from previous experiments, cells and other glassware were thoroughly cleaned by soaking in aqua regia when not in use and rinsed with DI water and the corresponding electrolyte reagent several times prior to use. The 0.1 M HClO\n\nand 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solutions were prepared from appropriate 70 wt% double-distilled HClO\n\nand KOH pellets with DI water, respectively. In particular, for all HOR and HER tests, the electrolytes were saturated with H\n\nor Ar (99.99%), respectively, by purging gas into the aqueous solutions for 30 min, and then maintaining the gas flow throughout the entire electrochemical measurements. Electrocatalyst inks were prepared by dispersing 5 mg of catalyst into a solution containing 25 μl of 5% Nafion 117 solution (as conducting binder) and 975 μl of DI water–isopropanol solution with equal volumes, followed by ultrasonication for 3 h. A three-electrode cell configuration was employed with a working electrode of glassy carbon RDE with 5 mm diameter, a counter electrode of graphite rod and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, the tip of the reference electrode was placed close to the working electrode to minimize solution resistance. Before each experiment, the glassy carbon electrode was polished to mirror shine with 0.05 μm alumina and cycled ~50 times from −0.2 to 1.5 V (versus RHE) at a sweep rate of 300 mV s\n−1\nin 0.5 M H\n\nSO\n\n. Then an aliquot with specified volume of the catalyst ink was drop-cast on the glassy carbon electrode and allowed to dry in air. To ensure the accuracy of the RHE, we calibrated the reference electrode in H\n\n-saturated 0.1 M HClO\n\nand 0.1 M KOH electrolytes periodically before conducting experiments. A reversible HOR/HER was performed using two Pt plates as both the working electrode and counter electrode (cleaned in aqua regia before each use) with H\n\nbubble over the working electrode during the period. To operate the calibration, the clean Pt electrode was cycled at a slow sweep rate of 10 mV s\n−1\naround the expected value for the RHE in each electrolyte to be used for the catalyst testing until the CV curve reached constant. Then the RHE potentials in the two electrolytes were determined from the corresponding open-circuit potentials (for example, Supplementary \n). All electrode potentials reported herein were converted to the RHE scale. The overpotential\nη\nwas calculated by\nη\n= |\nE\n(versus RHE)|V for both the HOR and HER. Additionally, for all the\nI\n–\nE\ncurves reported in this study, the solution resistance\nR\nwas measured via iR compensation command by applying the test potential, step amplitude, compensation level and overshoot level as 0 V, 0.05 V, 100% and 2%, respectively, which was subsequently used to correct the solution ohmic loss by\nE\n=\nE\nmeasured\n− iR. The reported current densities were either normalized to the geometric area of electrode (mA cm\n−2\n) or the amount of the metal in the catalyst (\n\\({\\mathrm{mA}}\\,{\\mathrm{mg}}_{\\mathrm{PGM}}^{-1}\\)\n).\nSeveral fast CV scans (200 mV s\n−1\n) between −0.09 and 0.4 V (versus RHE, without iR correction) were applied to remove the surface contaminants to achieve an unperturbedly stable performance before each RDE measurement. In cases where we aimed to assess the activity from polarization curves, we performed LSV measurements at a rotating speed of 1,600 r.p.m. and a low scan rate of 1 mV s\n−1\nto obtain steady polarization curves. All the measurements were repeated three times to ensure reproducibility. As the HOR is dominated by the mass transport of H\n\nto the electrode surface due to its limited solubility in electrolyte (<1 mmol l\n−1\nat room temperature), the limiting current density follows the Levich equation\n\nas:\n$${j}_{\\mathrm{l}}=0.62{{nFD}}^{2/3}{v}^{{\\rm{-}}1/6}{c}_{0}{\\omega }^{1/2}=B{c}_{0}{\\omega }^{1/2}$$\n\nwhere\nj\nl\nis the limiting current,\nn\nis the number of electrons transferred in the HOR (\nn\n= 2),\nF\nis the Faraday constant (96,485 A s mol\n−1\n),\nD\nis the diffusivity of H\n\nin electrolyte,\nν\nis the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte,\nc\n\nis the solubility of H\n\nin electrolyte and\nω\nis the rotation speed.\nB\nrepresents 0.62\nnFD\n2/3\nν\n−1/6\n. Since HOR/HER is highly reversible and controlled by both reaction kinetics and H\n\ndiffusion, a reversible Koutecky–Levich equation should be applied to extract the accurate kinetic current density for thin-film electrodes as follows\n\n:\n$$1/j=1/{j}_{{\\rm{k}}}+{j}_{{\\rm{d}}}$$\n\nwhere\nj, j\nk\nand\nj\nd\nrepresent the measured current density, kinetic current density and diffusion-limited current density, respectively. According to the definition,\nj\nd\nis proportional to\nj\nl\nat a given potential and shares the same rotation speed dependence\n\n:\n$${j}_{{\\rm{d}}}={j}_{1}\\left(1{\\rm{-}}{{\\exp }}\\left({\\rm{-}}2F\\eta /{RT}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nwhere\nη\nis the overpotential,\nR\nis the universal gas constant (8,314 J mol\n−1\nK\n−1\n) and\nT\nis the temperature in Kelvin. Then, the exchange current density (\nj\n\n) and transfer coefficient\nα\n, which is related to the Tafel slope (TS) by TS = 2.303\nRT\n/\nαF\n, can be determined by fitting the\nj\nk\nwith the Butler–Volmer equation\n\n:\n$${j}_{{\\rm{k}}}={j}_{0}({{\\exp }}(\\alpha F\\eta /{RT}\\,){\\rm{-}}{{\\exp }}((\\alpha -1)F\\eta /{RT}\\,))$$\n\nWhen conducting CO stripping experiments, the catalyst-modified glassy carbon electrodes were immersed in CO (99.99%)-saturated 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M HClO\n\nelectrolyte and kept at OCV for 15 min to poison the metal sites sufficiently, followed by purging H\n\nfor another 10 min to remove any excess CO from the solution and then collected the first two or five/ten cycles of CV curves at a scan rate of 50 mV s\n−1\n.\nComputational details\nThe spin-polarized DFT calculations with D3 van der Waals correction were performed with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) program\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. The exchange-correlation energy was described by the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) with spin-polarized Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional\n\n. The valence states of all atoms were expanded in a plane-wave (PW) basis set with a cut-off energy of 500 eV. The\nk\n-point grid of 3 × 3 × 1 was chosen to sample the reciprocal space. The self-consistent electron density loop was converged to 10\n−6\neV, and the structures were relaxed until all forces were below 0.02 eV Å\n−1\n. The single-iridium-atom catalyst was modelled by a layer of graphitic carbon (6 × 4 supercell) with Ir\n\n–P\n\n–N\n\n(Ir\n\n–P\n\n/NPG) or Ir\n\n–N\n\n(Ir\n\n/NG) embedded in the centre as shown in Supplementary \n. The vacuum layer was set as 20 Å.\nThe computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model was employed for the reaction free energy (Δ\nG\n) calculations\n\n. In this method, the chemical potential of (H\n+\n+\ne\n−\n) was equal to that of 1/2H\n\nand the Δ\nG\nof each step was derived by\n$$\\Delta G=\\Delta E{\\rm{-}}T\\Delta S+{\\rm{ZPE}}-{\\rm{|}}e{\\rm{|}}U$$\n\nwhere Δ\nE\nis the reaction energy of each step in the HOR from DFT calculations,\nT\nΔ\nS\nis the entropy contribution to the free energy, ZPE refers to the zero-point energy correction and\nU\nis the applied potential.\nAIMD simulation for the catalyst–water interface was performed by employing the CP2K package\n\n. The model contained 87 explicit H\n\nO molecules (~3 layers), which were filled in the vacuum layer (Supplementary \n). The simulation was sampled by the canonical (NVT) ensemble using Nosé–Hoover thermostats with a target temperature of 300 K, and the time step of 1.0 fs was chosen\n\n,\n\n. Core electrons were modelled by Goedecker–Teter–Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials with 17, 5, 5, 6 and 1 valence electrons for Ir, P, N, O and H atoms, respectively, and the plane waves were expanded with a cut-off energy of 400 Ry (\n). The (DFT + D3) method was also considered for the van der Waals correction.\nThe atomic coordinates of the optimized models, and the initial and final configurations in molecular dynamics simulations are provided in Supplementary Data\n\n.\nMEA preparation and PEMFC tests"

The H\n\n–He flow during TPR assures that prereduced metallic Ni remains unmodified while acquiring EXAFS at various temperatures.\nDuring TPR, the\nk\n\n-weighted EXAFS signals\nk\n\nχ\n(\nk\n) recorded from 60 °C \n, blue) to 150 °C \n, red) show a gradual damping of the EXAFS oscillations with increasing temperature, especially at high\nk\nvalues. This is caused by the Debye–Waller disorder factor\nσ\n\n, which dampens the EXAFS oscillations by a factor of\n\\({{\\rm{e}}}^{-{{{k}}}^{2}{\\sigma }^{2}}\\)\n(\n). The Debye–Waller factor scales to the width of the bond length distribution of the X-ray absorber–scatterer pairs \n). Hence, when the temperature of a material rises, the level of structural disorder goes up, leading to a broader bond length distribution and an increased Debye–Waller factor, thus damping the EXAFS signal. More quantitatively, at higher temperatures, the Debye and Einstein models describe that\nσ\n\n(\nT\n) follows a quasi-linear relation with the temperature\nT\n\n)\n\n.\nDamping of the\nk\n\nχ\n(\nk\n) EXAFS signal translates in a global decrease of the\nR\n-space EXAFS signal, being the magnitude of the Fourier-transformed (FT) EXAFS signal (|FT[\nk\n\nχ\n(\nk\n)]| = |\nχ\n(\nR\n)|; \n). The FT EXAFS signal relates to the radial distribution function around the X-ray absorber, in this case Ni, plotted as a function of the interatomic distance\nR\n.\nThe EXAFS–temperature correlation is now extracted by plotting ln(|\nχ\n(\nR\n)|\nmax\n) versus the Ni temperature \n), where |\nχ\n(\nR\n)|\nmax\nis the maximal magnitude of the first Ni coordination shell in the FT EXAFS signal (\nR\nmax\n≈ 2 Å; \n). ln(|\nχ\n(\nR\n)|\nmax\n) is a negative linear function of the Ni temperature, with low scatter (\nR\n\n= 0.9976).\nTo demonstrate the generality of the approach, the same methodology is adopted in a high-temperature range relevant to catalysis, that is 625–800 °C –i\n). The linear relationship between ln(|\nχ\n(\nR\n)|\nmax\n) and the Ni temperature again demonstrates excellent agreement (\nR\n\n= 0.9985). This underscores that the Ni temperature can be accurately extracted from the EXAFS–temperature relation over a relatively wide temperature range (60–800 °C; Supplementary \n), relevant to thermal catalytic processes. The 95% confidence interval for the temperature is calculated in the low- and high-temperature range and respectively corresponds to 2.7 °C and 4.0 °C (Supplementary \n). Notably, this confidence interval could vary for catalysts with different composition (Supplementary Note\n\n).\nEXAFS thermometry during CO\n\nconversion to extract kinetics\nBy instrumentalizing the EXAFS–temperature relation ,i\n), thermometry can now be applied to monitor the temperature of active nanoparticles during catalytic reaction. Therefore, a quartz capillary tube containing a catalyst bed with MgAl\n\nO\n\n-supported Ni nanoparticles (6.2 ± 2.2 nm; Supplementary \n) is positioned in an oven for homogeneous heat distribution \n). A thermocouple used for temperature control of the oven is positioned close to the end of the catalyst bed, within the quartz wool plug confining the bed. Operando QXAS is performed, yielding Ni K-edge spectra with 5 s time resolution. Two catalytic CO\n\nconversion processes are run at a setpoint temperature of 750 °C, each time using an identical Ni/MgAl\n\nO\n\ncatalyst \nand\n\nMethods\n): DRM (CO\n\n+ CH\n\n= 2CO + 2H\n\n), where the CO\n\n:CH\n\nratio is cycled between 2:1 and 1:1 in a period of 4 min, and the RWGS (CO\n\n+ H\n\n= CO + H\n\nO), where the CO\n\n:H\n\nratio is cycled between 1:1 and 0:1 in a period of 4 min. Both catalysts are operated under low-conversion conditions (<10%) and approach 100% CO selectivity. Before reaction cycling, the Ni catalyst is reduced by H\n\nTPR to 800 °C.

The dashed spectrum in\nc\nand\nf\ncorresponds to a NiO reference.\nFull size image\nFor the DRM reaction, the time-resolved X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and FT EXAFS spectra are plotted in \nand \n, respectively, with colours evolving from red to blue over time (0–120 min). XANES spectra remain constant and show that the Ni nanoparticles do not undergo phase changes (for example, oxidation), which would make EXAFS thermometry more challenging. The FT EXAFS time series displays a gradual increase in the amplitude of the first Ni coordination shell with time-on-stream, pointing towards a decrease of the Debye–Waller factor and, hence, a decreasing Ni nanoparticle temperature.\nThree aspects certify that the FT EXAFS amplitude increase is caused by temperature-induced Debye–Waller factor changes and does not originate from coordination number changes, which could also induce FT EXAFS amplitude changes (Supplementary Note\n\n): the fitted Ni–Ni coordination number of the FT EXAFS signal before, during and after reaction does not change (Supplementary \n, Supplementary Tables\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary Note\n\n), transmission electron microscopy analysis before and after reaction shows identical Ni nanoparticle size distributions (hence, no size changes; Supplementary \n) and no Ni surface oxidation or reduction processes underlie the FT EXAFS amplitude changes (Supplementary Note\n\n).\nQuantitatively mapping the Ni nanoparticle temperature versus the time-on-stream during DRM shows a drastic temperature decrease of the Ni nanoparticles by 90 °C offset to the setpoint temperature of the process over a period of 120 min \n, ). In addition, an oscillatory fine structure is superimposed upon the temperature decay, caused by the CO\n\n:CH\n\nratio cycling (vide infra). Surprisingly, however, the Ni nanoparticle temperature during the RWGS reaction does not show a decrease over time-on-stream, as corroborated by the constant XANES and stable FT EXAFS ,g,e\n, ).\nThese findings can be understood by linking these Ni nanoparticle temperature profiles to the DRM and RWGS reaction kinetics. Both DRM (Δ\nH\n\n= 250 kJ mol\n−1\n) and RWGS (Δ\nH\n\n= 42 kJ mol\n−1\n) are endothermic processes\n\n, implying that heat is absorbed from the Ni nanoparticles to execute the reaction. The total energy consumption during catalytic reaction equals the reaction enthalpy multiplied by the reaction rate. Hence, a combination of a highly endothermic reaction and a high activity clarifies the strong temperature decrease of Ni nanoparticles during DRM. For the RWGS reaction, the reaction enthalpy is one-fifth of the reaction enthalpy of DRM, but still well beyond 0 kJ mol\n−1\nand, hence, endothermic. A decrease of the Ni nanoparticle temperature would therefore be expected for high RWGS activities, which is not observed. Consequently, a relatively low activity can be held responsible for the stable Ni nanoparticle temperature during the RWGS reaction, as also suggested by mass spectrometry (Supplementary \n). Differences in the gas composition between RWGS and DRM reaction could influence the nanoparticle temperature, but do not underlie the discrepancy in the temperature observations between the RWGS and DRM reaction in \n(Supplementary Note\n\n). Therefore, these findings underpin that valuable information can be extracted indirectly on the chemical kinetics of catalysed reactions by monitoring the local temperature of the active phase.\nTo demonstrate the applicability of EXAFS thermometry at intermediate temperatures, the Ni nanoparticle temperature is monitored during the CO\n\nmethanation reaction (CO\n\n+ 4H\n\n= CH\n\n+ 2H\n\nO, Δ\nH\n\n= −165 kJ mol\n−1\n) at 350 °C (Supplementary Note\n\n, showcase I). The analysis shows a temperature increase of the Ni nanoparticle temperature—as opposed to the DRM and RWGS reactions—resulting from heat release during exothermic reactions. EXAFS thermometry is also applied on Pt\n\nSn nanoparticles during RWGS reaction (Supplementary Note\n\n, showcase II), showing the applicability of the methods on more complex multimetallic catalysts.\nTemperature bookkeeping at the nanoparticle level\nExtracting the real-time temperature of Ni nanoparticles operando during catalytic reaction now enables one to understand the impact of reaction-induced heat effects on the energy balance of active nanoparticles. The Ni nanoparticle temperature of the DRM process displays an oscillatory fine structure, which is superimposed on a globally decaying temperature profile \n). To interrogate the periodicity of these oscillations, the Fourier transform of the Ni nanoparticle temperature is depicted in \n, showing multiple signal contributions. A broad intensity band is present around 0 Hz, which originates from the globally decaying temperature throughout the entire process (a small\nω\nimplies long timescales). In addition, sharp features at ~0.004 Hz and ~0.008 Hz originate from the periodic Ni temperature oscillations on the timescale of a full cycle (1/0.004 s ≈ 240 s or 4 min) and a half cycle (1/0.008 s ≈ 120 s or 2 min). A full cycle consists of a 2 min half cycle of CO\n\n+ CH\n\nwith CO\n\n:CH\n\nratio 2:1, followed by a 2 min half cycle of CO\n\n+ CH\n\nwith CO\n\n:CH\n\nratio 1:1. Therefore, the gas cycling frequency clearly correlates with the Ni nanoparticle temperature fluctuations.\n\n.\nb\n, Three-dimensional |\nχ\n(\nR\n,\nt\n)| surface displaying the FT EXAFS magnitude in\nR\nspace as a function of time-on-stream from ~6 to 20 min.\nc\n, The Ni nanoparticle temperature extracted from\nb\nas well as the MS signal counts of the input gas feeds of CO\n\nand CH\n\nand reaction products CO and H\n\n.

The blue symbols indicate reaction heat draining out of the nanoparticle to execute DRM reaction, while the red arrows indicate heat transport into the nanoparticle from the external environment, that is, the gas phase and the support.\nFull size image\nThe FT EXAFS magnitude versus time-on-stream of the DRM process indeed shows alternating hills and valleys across the |\nχ\n(\nR\n,\nt\n)| landscape \n). From this |\nχ\n(\nR\n,\nt\n)| surface, the Ni nanoparticle temperature is extracted \n) and synchronized with the mass spectrometry (MS) counts of the CO\n\nand CH\n\nreactants and CO and H\n\nproducts. The vertical lines indicate the points in time where the CO\n\n:CH\n\nratio is switched from 1:1 to 2:1 and back, displaying a periodically decreasing–increasing–decreasing Ni nanoparticle temperature.\nAfter switching the CO\n\n:CH\n\nratio from 2:1 to 1:1 \n, label 1), the CO\n\n(CH\n\n) concentration in the gas flow gradually decreases (increases). Eventually, the gas feed evolves towards an equimolar, stoichiometric CO\n\n–CH\n\nmixture for the DRM reaction (CO\n\n+ CH\n\n= 2CO + 2H\n\n), thus maximizing conversion into CO and H\n\n. Quite the opposite, switching back the CO\n\n:CH\n\nratio from 1:1 to 2:1 by decreasing the CH\n\nflow leads to an excess of CO\n\n, label 2). This decreases the conversion compared with the CO\n\n:CH\n\n1:1 case, as evident from the decreasing H\n\nand CO MS signals.\nDue to gas mixing across the catalyst bed, the CO\n\n–CH\n\ngas feed composition transiently evolves over time, causing non-stationary feed conversion into CO and H\n\n). Consequently, the Ni nanoparticle temperature also dynamically evolves, because it is conversion dependent. To rationalize the trend in the Ni nanoparticle temperature, the nanoparticle’s energy state can be disentangled into two transient regimes (labelled 1 and 2 in \nand \n, respectively, connecting \n). In the regime depicted in \n, the CO\n\n:CH\n\nratio evolves to 1:1, implying a stoichiometric gas feed that maximizes conversion. Given the endothermic nature of the DRM reaction, the reaction heat supplied by the Ni nanoparticle to execute the DRM reaction (blue arrows) exceeds the transfer rate to supply heat to keep the Ni nanoparticle temperature constant (red arrows). This causes a transient decrease in the Ni nanoparticle temperature. In the regime depicted in \n, the CO\n\n:CH\n\nratio evolves to 2:1, implying that CH\n\nis present in substoichiometric quantities. Therefore, only half of the DRM reactions can be executed compared with the regime in \n, reducing the heat drain from the nanoparticle to the reaction. The heat supply rate from the environment to the nanoparticle now exceeds the consumption rate for reaction, thereby increasing the Ni nanoparticle temperature. By alternating between the CO\n\n:CH\n\nratios of 1:1 and 2:1, the Ni nanoparticle temperature transiently evolves through both regimes.\nThe cyclically evolving CO\n\n–CH\n\ngas feed composition can alter the thermal properties of the gas phase, thereby modulating the heat supply from the gas phase to the Ni nanoparticles, which might affect their temperature. In particular, more heat transfer to the Ni nanoparticles is expected under CO\n\n:CH\n\nratios of 1:1 compared with 2:1, which would lead to a temperature rise under the former conditions (Supplementary Note\n\n). However, under CO\n\n:CH\n\nratios of 1:1, the observations in \nshow that the Ni nanoparticle temperature still declines. Therefore, the more significant reaction-induced cooling under CO\n\n:CH\n\nratios of 1:1 (due to more DRM reaction than under CO\n\n:CH\n\n= 2:1) still dominates the enhanced gas-induced heating \n, red arrows), leading to a net decrease in the Ni nanoparticle temperature. It is possible, however, that enhanced gas-induced heating could dampen the oscillations in the Ni nanoparticle temperature.\nDiscussion\nThe observed temperature changes of active nanoparticles have wide implications. First, active nanoparticles can become a local heat sink or hotspot during endothermic and exothermic reaction. Such temperature deviations in the active phase, offset to the ideal process temperature, can lead to suboptimal\n\n,\n\n,\n\nor degrading\n\n,\n\nperformance. Second, temperature deviations can induce structural modifications, such as nanoparticle shape\n\n,\n\nor size\n\n,\n\nchanges, hence impacting the number and nature of active sites\n\nat the nanoparticle surface, again impacting performance.\nToday, EXAFS thermometry faces two main limitations. First, the technique requires nanoparticles with constant size, because size changes influence the FT EXAFS peak amplitude (Supplementary Note\n\n). However, multimodal approaches can fully alleviate this limitation by monitoring the nanoparticle size (for example, X-ray scattering) simultaneously with EXAFS thermometry, and correct for nanoparticle size changes. Second, EXAFS thermometry cannot probe the temperature of few-atom clusters or small nanoparticles, where the surface-to-volume ratio approaches 1. In such cases, most atoms of the nanoparticle reside at the surface, which can undergo structural changes during reaction by reactant or product binding, hence causing EXAFS thermometry to lose accuracy. Therefore, large phase-stable nanoparticles—oxides or metals—are desirable where the surface fraction becomes small.\nDespite these challenges, EXAFS thermometry stands out by several advantages compared with state-of-the-art catalysis thermometry methods. First, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is element specific, enabling EXAFS thermometry selectively and flexibly at the phase of interest in a broad set of catalytic systems. This enables one to monitor the temperature of the catalytically active phase and the passive support separately to chart temperature discrepancies between different catalyst components. Second, X-rays have higher penetrative power through a material\n\nand achieve higher spatial resolution than visible–IR light in luminescence–IR thermometry\n\n. This endows EXAFS thermometry with the potential to map temperature heterogeneities within catalyst bodies with nanoscale resolution in an element-selective way. Ultimately, temperature bookkeeping can be achieved within complex catalyst bodies by mapping the temperature of individual catalyst components to chart intraparticle heat flows. By extension, temperature heterogeneities on the reactor scale can be mapped under different conditions (dilutions, bed packing strategies and flow rates). Finally, EXAFS thermometry can monitor the temperature of the catalyst as-is, without modification by luminescent sensors. While sophisticated, these sensors might degrade under harsh reaction conditions, are challenging to use when coke is formed or, at worst, participate in reaction. Also, heat transport limitations may arise between the active phase and a spatially remote luminescent sensor, potentially leading to perturbed interpretation.\nIn summary, this analysis of EXAFS thermometry reveals its capability to selectively monitor the dynamic temperature variations within active Ni nanoparticles during catalytic CO\n\nconversion. This method demonstrates significant temperature fluctuations within the nanoparticles responsible for catalysis, indicating that reaction heat directly impacts the energy balance of the nanoparticles, consequently affecting their temperature. In addition, by temperature bookkeeping at the single nanoparticle level, we demonstrate that EXAFS thermometry can extract information on catalytic reaction kinetics. In fact, EXAFS thermometry is an a posteriori analysis approach following time-resolved XAS data collection. Hence, a treasure of temperature information resides in existing XAS datasets worldwide. Revisiting the analysis of these datasets—increasingly available in repositories\n\n—might shine light on reaction-induced temperature phenomena in heterogeneous catalysts and demystify their catalytic consequences.\n\nCatalyst synthesis"

Various combinations of metal centres (Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) and mass diffusion channels in two dimensions and three dimensions were achieved. Using CO\n\nreduction to CO as an example, our Ni single atom catalyst with three-dimensional diffusion channels delivered a practical current of 350 mA cm\n−2\nwhile maintaining a 93% CO Faradaic efficiency, representing a sixfold improvement in turnover frequency compared to two-dimensional counterparts.\n\nsynthesis methods for different SACs\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n.\nIn general, the catalytic performance of SACs, including activity and selectivity, is mainly governed by two factors: the intrinsic nature of the single metal atomic sites, which is determined by the atomic structure of the isolated atom centres, and the accessibility of these active sites and the transport properties of catalysis-relevant species, which are determined by the microscopic structure of the support\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Various physical and chemical strategies, including wet impregnation, galvanic replacement and high-temperature pyrolysis, have been developed for the preparation of different SACs over the past few years\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Most of the synthetic methods of SACs reported up to now have focused on two points: one is the precise and general tuning of different metal centres and non-metal coordination\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, and the other is substantially increasing the density of single atomic sites for higher activity\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Indeed, these two strategies are important in improving the catalytic performance of SACs. In particular, the tuning of atomic structures can boost activity and selectivity for some important catalytic reactions\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. However, the mesoporous structure of SACs, which is beyond the atomic scale of the active sites, is often overlooked but could impact the catalytic performance, especially under practical operation conditions. Using SAC electrocatalysis as an example, within low current density regions, mass diffusions are usually not problematic, and the catalytic performance is dominated by the intrinsic activity of the single atomic site as well as its density\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Once the reaction rates approach the industrially relevant range (>100 mA cm\n−2\n), the mass diffusion of reactants or products, which is usually determined by the microscale structures (nanopores or nanochannels) around the active site, could play an even more important role than the active site itself. While previous SAC synthesis methods have demonstrated excellent control in the single atomic site structure, very few studies have reported additional tunability in the microscopic structure surrounding the atomic sites for SACs.\nHere we report a general SAC synthesis method with flexible control in both the atomic structure of the single atomic site as well as the mesoporous structure of the carbon support for optimized catalytic performance. Assisted by different types of hard templates, we successfully fabricated a family of M-SACs (M = Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) as well as multi-M-SACs including binary, ternary, quaternary and up to seven different metal centres. More importantly, by tuning the mesoporous structure of the hard template, we were able to control the mass diffusions in the carbon matrix in a three-dimensional (3D) or two-dimensional (2D) manner, and thus gained a control in the catalyst’s reaction activity especially under large reaction rates. Using the electrochemical CO\n\nreduction reaction (CO\n\nRR) on the same Ni single atomic site as a representative reaction, we demonstrated the significant impacts of this microstructural control in Ni-SACs on their CO\n\nRR performances in delivering industrially relevant current densities. As a result, while the CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) values on different Ni-SACs are quite similar under low current densities (≤50 mA cm\n−2\n), our Ni-SAC with 3D diffusion channels maintains a more than 90% CO FE under a large current density of 350 mA cm\n−2\n, dramatically outperforming the other 2D mass diffusion Ni-SACs as well as previous reports. The difference in CO\n\nRR turnover frequency (TOF) values on the same Ni single atomic site can reach up to 6.6-fold, suggesting the importance of microstructure tuning in SACs for their industrial application in the future.\n\nSynthesis of Ni-SACs with different microscale structures\nWe first took Ni-SAC as a typical example to demonstrate our strategy for synthesizing M-SACs with controllable mesoporous structures. The synthesis of Ni-SAC involved a three-step process\n\nsynthesis method can help to precisely control similar single metal atomic sites while flexibly tuning the catalysts’ microscale structures.\n\nis the diffraction angle.\n\nsynthesis method\nWe further demonstrated the easy adaptability of our hard-template synthesis method towards a wide range of unary transition metal single atom catalysts (M-SACs, M = Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) as well as a flexible combination of multi-metal SACs (multi-M-SACs) for possible future applications (Supplementary \n). TEM images successfully confirmed that the mesoporous structures we observed in Ni-SACs could be well maintained when the Ni centre was changed to other metals (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). X-ray diffraction patterns suggested no detectable metal particles in all the prepared M-SACs (Supplementary \n). The atomic dispersion of different metals was further confirmed by STEM –h\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n) and EDS mapping (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n) images as well as EXAFS spectra (Supplementary \n) with a loading ranging from 1.76 to 4.11 wt% (Supplementary \n), suggesting the versatility of our hard-template method in synthesizing different single atomic sites without metal clusters or nanoparticles. All the metal centres showed an oxidation state between the metallic and oxide counterparts, as shown by the XANES spectra (Supplementary \n), which can be explained by the M–N coordination environment confirmed by EELS point spectra (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). It is believed that the principle governing the formation of SACs for different metal elements (M = Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) by our methods is as follows: Highly stable M–N bonds form during the pyrolysis of M-P\n\nsynthesis of various unary M-SACs, we further extended our hard-template synthesis strategy to different combinations of multi-M-SACs, represented by binary NiCo-SAC, ternary NiCoMn-SAC, quaternary NiCoMnZn-SAC, quinary NiCoMnZnCu-SAC, senary NiCoMnZnCuSc-SAC and up to septenary NiCoMnZnCuScFe-SAC. Different single metal atomic sites in one catalyst could help to promote multi-step catalytic reactions\n\n,\n\n. All characterizations including XPS, X-ray diffraction, STEM and EXAFS indicated successful synthesis of different combinations of multi-M-SACs (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nsynthesis method can flexibly control not only the atomic structure of metal sites for intrinsic activity but also the mesoporous structure of the carbon matrix for mass diffusions. While most reports on SACs focus on tuning the intrinsic activity of single atomic sites, the impact of a systematic control in mass diffusions on catalytic performance, especially under significant reaction rates, is often overlooked. Here we use electrocatalytic CO\n\nRR as a representative reaction for demonstration. Since CO\n\nRR occurs at the gas–liquid–solid triple-phase boundary, the accessibility of CO\n\nsynthesis strategy enables us to obtain M-SACs with different types of porous structures for a better control of internal mass diffusions. First, due to the generality of the hard-template-assisted method, we can easily compare the effect of the atomic structure of the single atomic site on CO\n\nRR performance.

By contrast, the precise control of the mesoporous structure in the matrix material, which directly correlates with mass diffusions and may play a dominant role in delivering industrially relevant reaction rates, has been overlooked. Here we report a general method for the synthesis of a single atom catalyst with control of the atomic structure of the single atomic site as well as the mesoporous structure of the carbon support for optimized catalytic performance. Various combinations of metal centres (Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) and mass diffusion channels in two dimensions and three dimensions were achieved. Using CO\n\nreduction to CO as an example, our Ni single atom catalyst with three-dimensional diffusion channels delivered a practical current of 350 mA cm\n−2\nwhile maintaining a 93% CO Faradaic efficiency, representing a sixfold improvement in turnover frequency compared to two-dimensional counterparts.\n\nYou have full access to this article via\nTsinghua University\n.\nDownload PDF\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nA single-atom library for guided monometallic and concentration-complex multimetallic designs\nArticle\n\n. This wide range of applications relies on the development of controllable and precise synthesis methods for different SACs\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n.\nIn general, the catalytic performance of SACs, including activity and selectivity, is mainly governed by two factors: the intrinsic nature of the single metal atomic sites, which is determined by the atomic structure of the isolated atom centres, and the accessibility of these active sites and the transport properties of catalysis-relevant species, which are determined by the microscopic structure of the support\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Various physical and chemical strategies, including wet impregnation, galvanic replacement and high-temperature pyrolysis, have been developed for the preparation of different SACs over the past few years\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Most of the synthetic methods of SACs reported up to now have focused on two points: one is the precise and general tuning of different metal centres and non-metal coordination\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, and the other is substantially increasing the density of single atomic sites for higher activity\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Indeed, these two strategies are important in improving the catalytic performance of SACs. In particular, the tuning of atomic structures can boost activity and selectivity for some important catalytic reactions\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. However, the mesoporous structure of SACs, which is beyond the atomic scale of the active sites, is often overlooked but could impact the catalytic performance, especially under practical operation conditions. Using SAC electrocatalysis as an example, within low current density regions, mass diffusions are usually not problematic, and the catalytic performance is dominated by the intrinsic activity of the single atomic site as well as its density\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Once the reaction rates approach the industrially relevant range (>100 mA cm\n−2\n), the mass diffusion of reactants or products, which is usually determined by the microscale structures (nanopores or nanochannels) around the active site, could play an even more important role than the active site itself. While previous SAC synthesis methods have demonstrated excellent control in the single atomic site structure, very few studies have reported additional tunability in the microscopic structure surrounding the atomic sites for SACs.\nHere we report a general SAC synthesis method with flexible control in both the atomic structure of the single atomic site as well as the mesoporous structure of the carbon support for optimized catalytic performance. Assisted by different types of hard templates, we successfully fabricated a family of M-SACs (M = Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) as well as multi-M-SACs including binary, ternary, quaternary and up to seven different metal centres. More importantly, by tuning the mesoporous structure of the hard template, we were able to control the mass diffusions in the carbon matrix in a three-dimensional (3D) or two-dimensional (2D) manner, and thus gained a control in the catalyst’s reaction activity especially under large reaction rates. Using the electrochemical CO\n\nreduction reaction (CO\n\nRR) on the same Ni single atomic site as a representative reaction, we demonstrated the significant impacts of this microstructural control in Ni-SACs on their CO\n\nRR performances in delivering industrially relevant current densities. As a result, while the CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) values on different Ni-SACs are quite similar under low current densities (≤50 mA cm\n−2\n), our Ni-SAC with 3D diffusion channels maintains a more than 90% CO FE under a large current density of 350 mA cm\n−2\n, dramatically outperforming the other 2D mass diffusion Ni-SACs as well as previous reports. The difference in CO\n\nRR turnover frequency (TOF) values on the same Ni single atomic site can reach up to 6.6-fold, suggesting the importance of microstructure tuning in SACs for their industrial application in the future.\n\nResults\n\nSynthesis of Ni-SACs with different microscale structures\nWe first took Ni-SAC as a typical example to demonstrate our strategy for synthesizing M-SACs with controllable mesoporous structures. The synthesis of Ni-SAC involved a three-step process\n\nand\n\nMethods\n). First, different types of SiO\n\nhard templates (that is, SiO\n\nnanoparticles (SiO\n\n-NPs), Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA-15) or Mobil Composition of Matter no. 48 (MCM-48)) were added into an aqueous solution of NiCl\n\nand\no\n-phenylenediamine (\no\nPD). Then, ammonium peroxydisulphate, that is, (NH\n\n)\n\nS\n\nO\n\n, was used to fully polymerize\no\nPD to obtain the Ni–P\no\nPD–SiO\n\ncomposites. Finally, the composites underwent pyrolysis, NaOH etching and H\n\nSO\n\netching to afford three types of Ni-SACs, including Ni-SAC/SiO\n\n-NPs, Ni-SAC/SBA-15 and Ni-SAC/MCM-48. We would expect similar Ni atomic structures, but different microscopic structures and mass diffusion behaviours resulted in our as-prepared Ni-SACs depending on the type of hard template used, as shown in ,c\n. We first examined the microstructures of different Ni-SACs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM; –f\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). An interconnected 3D vesicle-like structure with well-defined pores, a well-aligned unidirectional 2D array structure and a multidirectional 2D channel structure were observed for Ni-SAC/SiO\n\n-NPs, Ni-SAC/SBA-15 and Ni-SAC/MCM-48, respectively. We renamed these samples 3D-Ni-SAC, 2D-UD-Ni-SAC and 2D-MD-Ni-SAC, respectively, to better differentiate their mass diffusion channels in the following discussion of electrocatalysis. Secondary electron (SE), HAADF-STEM and TEM images of the same area further revealed the pore structure of typical Ni-SACs (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Electron tomography was performed on Ni-SAC/SBA-15 in order to better show the linear array of pores within the carbon structure (Supplementary \nand Supplementary Video\n\n). Measurements performed on HAADF-STEM images taken at different tilts determined the pore array spacing of 5.1 ± 0.5 nm, with an average pore diameter of approximately 2.5 nm. These well-defined mesoporous structures originated from the structural characteristics of the hard templates being used, demonstrating that the mesoporous structure of SACs can be accurately controlled and tuned via the hard-template-assisted strategy. We also employed N\n\nadsorption–desorption isotherms to study the textural properties of as-obtained Ni-SACs. A remarkable hysteresis loop of type IV was observed for all three types of Ni-SACs, indicating the mesoporous structure of the Ni-SACs (Supplementary \n). The mesopore size distribution was centred at 12.9, 3.5 and 3.9 nm for Ni-SAC/SiO\n\n-NPs, Ni-SAC/SBA-15 and Ni-SAC/MCM-48, respectively, suggesting that the 3D-Ni-SAC has a relatively larger pore size compared to the other 2D counterparts. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area and total pore volume of the 3D-Ni-SAC (325.2 m\n\ng\n−1\nand 0.62 cm\n\ng\n−1\n) also showed a clear improvement compared with the 2D counterparts (270.3 m\n\ng\n−1\nand 0.23 cm\n\ng\n−1\nfor 2D-UD-Ni-SAC, and 269.1 m\n\ng\n−1\nand 0.21 cm\n\ng\n−1\nfor 2D-MD-Ni-SAC; Supplementary \n), which could dramatically improve mass diffusions during catalysis. Furthermore, the structure of Ni-SAC/SBA-15 was revealed by a small-angle X-ray diffraction pattern (Supplementary \n).\n\nhard template were used for constructing M-SACs with different mesoporous structures.\nb\n, Proposed atomic structure of M-SACs.

All sets of images show Ni-SAC/SiO\n\n-NPs, Ni-SAC/SBA-15 and Ni-SAC/MCM-48, respectively. The Ni-SACs showed different morphologies, which originated from the different SiO\n\nhard templates. The 3D and 2D mass diffusion channels were clearly observed. However, the three Ni-SACs had very similar compositions.\nFull size image\nWhile the microscopic structure of Ni-SACs can be flexibly controlled via different hard templates, their Ni single atomic site can be kept the same for fair comparisons, which was confirmed via systematic microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations. First, our TEM and HAADF-STEM characterizations confirmed the absence of nanoparticles or clusters in all the Ni-SAC samples –f\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). By sharp contrast, embedded nanoparticles were still observed in Ni catalyst prepared without hard templates (Supplementary \nand\n\nMethods\n), even though the same acid etching process was performed. Therefore, we believe that the hard templates helped to generate porous structures and avoid the formation of embedded nanoparticles in carbon matrix\n\n. The porous structures allowed acids to reach to and dissolve unembedded metal nanoparticles. Aberration-corrected medium-angle annular dark-field STEM (MAADF-STEM) characterization of Ni-SACs showed the uniform isolated distribution of Ni single atoms in the carbon matrix –i\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping analysis indicated a homogeneous distribution of C, N and Ni on these Ni-SACs –l\n). The Ni metal loadings evaluated by inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry data were 3.76, 5.19 and 4.32 wt% in Ni-SAC/SiO\n\n-NPs, Ni-SAC/SBA-15 and Ni-SAC/MCM-48, respectively (Supplementary \n). While the Ni atom density in different samples was quite similar, the Ni-SAC/SiO\n\n-NPs sample presented the lowest Ni loading.\nSecond, several spectroscopic characterization tools helped to reveal the local coordination structures and electronic properties of our Ni-SAC samples \n). The X-ray diffraction patterns of Ni-SACs presented a broad peak centred around 25.6° \n), corresponding to the plane of graphitic carbon. No Ni particle peaks were observed for all three Ni-SAC samples. The graphitic quality of the carbon support was very similar in different Ni-SACs as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy \n), which agrees well with the high-resolution TEM images in Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n. To better understand the electronic properties of our Ni-SACs, we first analysed their Ni and N oxidation states using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ,d\n, Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). The N 1\ns\nspectra \n) suggested that there were four types of nitrogen dopants in Ni-SACs, including pyridinic N (~398.5 eV), pyrrolic N (~399.8 eV), graphitic N (~400.9 eV) and oxidized N (~402.5 eV)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. The slight difference in the ratios of the four types of nitrogen among three Ni-SACs had a negligible effect on CO\n\nRR performances (Supplementary \nand Supplementary Note\n\n). Besides, there was no obvious Si 2\np\nXPS signal found, suggesting that the hard templates had been removed completely (Supplementary –e\n). The Ni 2\np\nregions of all three samples displayed similar binding energies at ~855.2 eV (higher than Ni metal at 852.6 eV), indicating similar oxidation states of Ni single atoms \n)\n\n. This result also agrees well with X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra where the Ni K edges of all three samples are similar and sit between Ni metal and NiO \n). The local coordination property of Ni atoms was further revealed by extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectrometry (EXAFS), where the real space of all Ni-SACs exhibited the same dominant peak at around 1.4 Å. This coordination environment successfully excluded the existence of Ni metal particles or clusters (~2.2 Å) across the whole matrix and can be assigned to Ni–N coordination at the first shell \n), consistent with our angstrom-resolution point analysis of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) on a single Ni atomic site (Supplementary \n). Furthermore, the EXAFS fitting results showed that the central Ni atom was coordinated by approximately four N atoms for all three Ni-SACs (Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n). The above characterization results strongly support our hypothesis that this hard-template synthesis method can help to precisely control similar single metal atomic sites while flexibly tuning the catalysts’ microscale structures.\n\nis the diffraction angle.\n\nb\n, Raman spectra.\nI\nD\nand\nI\nG\nare the intensity of D band and G band, respectively.\nc\n–\nf\n, High-resolution N 1\ns\nXPS spectra (\nc\n), Ni 2\np\nXPS spectra (\nd\n), XANES (\ne\n) and EXAFS spectra at the Ni K edge (\nf\n).

The three Ni-SACs showed very similar compositions and atomic structures.\nFull size image\n\nThe versatility of the hard-template synthesis method\nWe further demonstrated the easy adaptability of our hard-template synthesis method towards a wide range of unary transition metal single atom catalysts (M-SACs, M = Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) as well as a flexible combination of multi-metal SACs (multi-M-SACs) for possible future applications (Supplementary \n). TEM images successfully confirmed that the mesoporous structures we observed in Ni-SACs could be well maintained when the Ni centre was changed to other metals (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). X-ray diffraction patterns suggested no detectable metal particles in all the prepared M-SACs (Supplementary \n). The atomic dispersion of different metals was further confirmed by STEM –h\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n) and EDS mapping (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n) images as well as EXAFS spectra (Supplementary \n) with a loading ranging from 1.76 to 4.11 wt% (Supplementary \n), suggesting the versatility of our hard-template method in synthesizing different single atomic sites without metal clusters or nanoparticles. All the metal centres showed an oxidation state between the metallic and oxide counterparts, as shown by the XANES spectra (Supplementary \n), which can be explained by the M–N coordination environment confirmed by EELS point spectra (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). It is believed that the principle governing the formation of SACs for different metal elements (M = Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) by our methods is as follows: Highly stable M–N bonds form during the pyrolysis of M-P\n\no\nPd templates, and some M-based nanoparticles also form due to excess metal precursors. Based on our previous simulations\n\n, using Ni as a representative example, the isolated Ni–N atomic sites are thermodynamically more stable than Ni metal particles. This is the case for many transition metals due to their strong M–N bonds. The hard templates help to create many mesopores but also avoid the formation of the structure of metal nanoparticles fully encapsulated into carbon. During the acid leaching process, all nanoparticles can be reached and dissolved by H\n\nSO\n\n, while stable M–N bonds survive during this process; thus, M-SACs are obtained by our method. In addition, the coordination atoms and compositions of carbon supports also can be tuned by using different molecular precursors, such as 2,2′-bithiophene, pyrrole and aniline (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary \n). Greatly encouraged by the successful synthesis of various unary M-SACs, we further extended our hard-template synthesis strategy to different combinations of multi-M-SACs, represented by binary NiCo-SAC, ternary NiCoMn-SAC, quaternary NiCoMnZn-SAC, quinary NiCoMnZnCu-SAC, senary NiCoMnZnCuSc-SAC and up to septenary NiCoMnZnCuScFe-SAC. Different single metal atomic sites in one catalyst could help to promote multi-step catalytic reactions\n\n,\n\n. All characterizations including XPS, X-ray diffraction, STEM and EXAFS indicated successful synthesis of different combinations of multi-M-SACs (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary Note\n\n).\n\n, Aberration-corrected MAADF/HAADF-STEM of unary M-SACs. The active centres of M-SACs can be easily tuned by our hard-template synthesis method.\n\nFull size image\nElectrochemical CO\n\nRR on different Ni-SACs\nThe above material characterizations clearly demonstrated that our hard-template synthesis method can flexibly control not only the atomic structure of metal sites for intrinsic activity but also the mesoporous structure of the carbon matrix for mass diffusions. While most reports on SACs focus on tuning the intrinsic activity of single atomic sites, the impact of a systematic control in mass diffusions on catalytic performance, especially under significant reaction rates, is often overlooked. Here we use electrocatalytic CO\n\nRR as a representative reaction for demonstration. Since CO\n\nRR occurs at the gas–liquid–solid triple-phase boundary, the accessibility of CO\n\ngas therefore plays a critical role in CO\n\nRR activity. In recent years, extensive studies employed a gas diffusion layer electrode in flow cell reactors to overcome the CO\n\ngas diffusion limitations in an H-type cell and dramatically improved CO\n\nRR activity\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. However, although the external mass transfer of CO\n\ngas from the CO\n\nstream to the catalyst layer can be greatly improved by a gas diffusion layer, the internal mass diffusion within the catalyst layer, which is strongly correlated with the catalyst’s mesoporous structure, has been rarely emphasized but could play an even more important role in delivering industrially relevant current densities. Our general hard-template synthesis strategy enables us to obtain M-SACs with different types of porous structures for a better control of internal mass diffusions. First, due to the generality of the hard-template-assisted method, we can easily compare the effect of the atomic structure of the single atomic site on CO\n\nRR performance. Among different M-SACs, our Ni-SAC showed the best CO\n\n-to-CO selectivity at 10 mA cm\n−2\ncurrent in a standard three-electrode flow cell reactor (\n\nMethods\n), suggesting the best CO\n\nRR intrinsic activity on Ni single atoms \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Some recent theoretical studies have revealed that the weakest CO binding and highest hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) barrier on a Ni single atom could account for the most selective CO\n\nRR performance over Ni-SAC catalysts\n\n,\n\n. Additionally, nitrogen-doped carbon (NC/SBA-15) without single Ni atoms showed a very poor CO\n\n-to-CO selectivity at all tested potentials (Supplementary \n), further indicating that the good CO\n\n-to-CO selectivity of Ni-SAC originated from the single Ni atoms. The three types of Ni-SACs we synthesized with the same single Ni atomic sites but different mass diffusion channels (3D, 2D-UD and 2D-MD) therefore become the best materials platform for us to study the impact of mass diffusions.\n\nelectrolyte.\na\n, The FE values of H\n\nand CO for various M-SAC/SBA-15 samples at 10 mA cm\n−2\n.\nb\n–\ne\n, The\nI\n–\nV\ncurves (\nb\n), corresponding CO FE values (\nc\n), CO partial current densities (\nj\nCO\n;\nd\n) and TOF values (\ne\n) of 3D-Ni-SAC, 2D-UD-Ni-SAC and 2D-MD-Ni-SAC.\nf\n, Comparison of the CO\n\nRR performance of our 3D-Ni-SAC and 3D-Ni-SAC-MP with values from previous reports.

The divide of the diffusion-limited and kinetics-limited regions in\nb\n–\ne\nis based on the tested CO\n\nRR performance for three Ni-SACs.\nSource data\nFull size image\nThe\nI\n–\nV\ncurves in \nshow that our three types of Ni-SACs present quite similar CO\n\nreduction onset potentials and catalytic activities between –0.43 to –0.63 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (versus RHE). As the current densities within this region are still small (≤20 mA cm\n−2\n), they were not yet impacted by the internal CO\n\ndiffusions, suggesting that all the samples have similar intrinsic CO\n\nRR activities. However, this overlapping situation starts to change under more negative potentials and larger currents. While the two 2D channel mass diffusion catalysts, 2D-UD-Ni-SAC and 2D-MD-Ni-SAC, still have similar CO\n\nRR activities, the 3D-Ni-SAC presents significantly improved current densities under the same potentials. Specifically, our 3D-Ni-SAC could reach a large current density of 350 mA cm\n−2\nat –0.87 V versus RHE, which is 3.5 times higher compared to the 2D-Ni-SACs. Besides the activity, the CO selectivity of 3D-Ni-SAC was also greatly improved from its 2D counterparts even when operated under much larger current densities \n). The CO selectivity of 2D-Ni-SACs reached a maximum of ~95% at 50 mA cm\n−2\nwith potentials around –0.76 V, but decreased to only ~70% when they needed to sustain a 100 mA cm\n−2\ncurrent at circa –0.87 V, which could be limited by their internal mass diffusions. By sharp contrast, our 3D-Ni-SAC delivered a 98.5% CO selectivity under 100 mA cm\n−2\n, and still maintained a 93% selectivity under 350 mA cm\n−2\n, which corresponds to a CO partial current of 325 mA cm\n−2\n\n). The density of single Ni atoms in 3D-Ni-SAC is lower than that of the 2D-Ni-SACs, excluding the possibility that the better activity originates from a higher density of active sites. The mass diffusion impact was further revealed when we calculated the TOF of our three Ni-SACs by normalizing the CO\n\nRR activity to the number of single Ni atomic sites \n). The TOF values of the three samples are quite similar within the kinetics-limited region, again confirming their similar Ni active sites. Once in the diffusion-limited region, while the two 2D channel mass diffusion catalysts presented similar TOF values, our 3D-Ni-SAC showed an up to sixfold improvement compared to the 2D-Ni-SACs. It is clear that the low TOF values of our 2D-Ni-SACs are mainly due to the limited CO\n\nmass diffusions to the active sites under significant reaction rates. Additionally, the partial current density for CO production, normalized by the electrochemical active surface area, further confirmed the intrinsically higher activity of 3D-Ni-SAC compared with the 2D-Ni-SACs in the diffusion-limited region (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Therefore, these CO\n\nRR results clearly support our point that a precise control of the single atomic sites is important but still not adequate to push SACs towards practical application; in addition, one also needs flexible control of a SAC’s microscale structures to ensure efficient mass diffusions, which play a dominant role in delivering industrially relevant reaction rates. With 3D channels for fast CO\n\ndiffusion, the CO\n\n-to-CO performance of our 3D-Ni-SAC is among the best compared to previous reports, including noble metal catalysts\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, metal porphyrins/phthalocyanines\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, SACs\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\nand non-noble metal-based catalysts\n\n,\n\n,\n\nand Supplementary \n). Furthermore, based on our understanding of the importance of pore structures, we optimized the pore structures of our 3D-Ni-SAC including mesopore sizes and the presence of micropores to further enhance its CO\n\nRR performance (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary Note\n\n). We found that 3D-Ni-SAC with small mesopore sizes and many micropores could further improve the CO\n\nRR performance. Particularly, 3D-Ni-SAC with many micropores (3D-Ni-SAC-MP) can deliver a CO partial current of circa 450 mA cm\n−2\nwith a CO FE of 99.9% at −0.86 V \nand Supplementary \n).\nTo circumvent the flooding issue of the gas diffusion layer electrode in a flow cell reactor and evaluate the CO\n\nRR stability of our 3D-Ni-SAC, an anion membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell was constructed –c\n). The cathode side was continuously supplied with a humidified CO\n\nstream for CO\n\nRR, while the anode side was circulated with 0.1 M KHCO\n\nsolution for the oxygen evolution reaction \n). The CO\n\nconversion begins at ~2.2 V cell voltage, with a peak CO selectivity of 99% under a current density of 150 mA cm\n−2\n,c\n). The current density can be further increased to an industrially relevant level of 400 mA cm\n−2\nat ~3.5 V while maintaining ~92.5% CO selectivity ,c\n), representing one of the best CO production rate on SACs reported so far, to the best of our knowledge (Supplementary \n). Besides the excellent CO\n\n-to-CO activities and selectivity, our 3D-Ni-SAC presented good stability. A 40-hour continuous operation of CO\n\nRR electrolysis was performed by holding a 100 mA cm\n−2\ncurrent density in the MEA cell and showed negligible degradation in either selectivity or activity \n).\n\n, Schematic of the anion MEA cell.

A family of M-SACs (M = Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) as well as multi-M-SACs including binary, ternary, quaternary and up to seven different metal centres have been synthesized. More importantly, the SACs can be finely tuned with different mesoporous structures, which controls different types of mass diffusion (3D and 2D) that play a dominant role in delivering industrially relevant reaction rates. The ability of this method to control the atomic and microscopic structures enables us to obtain a superior SAC (that is, 3D-Ni-SAC), which exhibited an excellent CO FE at an industrially relevant current for the CO\n\nSynthesis of Ni-SACs with different microscale structures\nTypically, 1.0 g\n\no\nPD, 0.405 g NiCl\n\n·6H\n\nO and 1.0 g SiO\n\nhard template (that is, SiO\n\n-NPs, SBA-15 or MCM-48) were added into 20 ml 1.0 M HCl solution, sonicated for 10 min and then stirred for ~0.5 h. Then, 12 ml 1.0 M HCl solution containing 3.0 g (NH\n\n)\n\nS\n\nO\n\nwas added dropwise with vigorous stirring. After polymerization of\no\nPD in an ice bath for ~24 h, the mixture was dried using a rotary evaporator. Subsequently, the obtained dried powder was subjected to a pyrolysis process under flowing Ar at 800 °C for 2 h. Finally, the product underwent alkaline (2.0 M NaOH) and acidic (2.0 M H\n\nSO\n\n) leaching successively to remove the SiO\n\ntemplate and unstable metallic species, respectively, to obtain the Ni-SAC samples.\n\nThe synthesis method of various M-SACs is the same as that of Ni-SACs. However, 0.22 g CoCl\n, 0.456 g Mn(NO\n\n)\n\n·4H\n\nO, 0.457 g Zn(NO\n\n)\n\n·6H\n\nO, 0.27 g CuCl\n\n·4H\n\nO, 0.577 g ScCl\n\n·6H\n\nO and 0.29 g FeCl\n\nwere used for preparing Co-, Mn-, Zn-, Cu-, Sc- and Fe-SAC, respectively.\n\nSynthesis of multi-M-SACs\nWe also used the same synthesis processes to prepare multi-M-SACs, including binary NiCo-SAC/SBA-15, ternary NiCoMn-SAC/SBA-15, quaternary NiCoMnZn-SAC/SBA-15, quinary NiCoMnZnCu-SAC/SBA-15, senary NiCoMnZnCuSc-SAC/SBA-15 and septenary NiCoMnZnCuScFe-SAC/SiO\n\n, with the only difference being that the corresponding multiple metal salt precursors were simultaneously used for multi-M-SACs.\n\nSynthesis of Ni catalyst with embedded nanoparticles\nThe Ni catalyst with embedded nanoparticles was prepared for comparison. Its synthesis process was similar to that of the various SACs. However, for synthesizing Ni catalyst with embedded nanoparticles, SiO\n\nhard templates were not used, and thus the step of alkaline leaching was omitted.\n\nCharacterization\nTEM observations were carried out on a Talos F200X transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV equipped with an energy-dispersive detector. Aberration-corrected MAADF-STEM images and EELS point spectra were captured in a Nion UltraSTEM U100 operated at 60 keV and equipped with a Gatan Enfina electron energy loss spectrometer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. HAADF-STEM and aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images were performed using a JEM-ARM200F atomic resolution analytical microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Elemental mapping images were collected on a Talos F200X transmission electron microscope and a Nion UltraSTEM U100. For tomographic analysis, Pt nanoparticles were first loaded onto samples to serve as fiducial markers for image alignment. Electron tomography datasets were acquired using a Hummingbird tomography holder with a tilt range from +75 to −75 degrees on a JEOL NEOARM operated at 200 kV. Simultaneous bright-field (BF), HAADF and low-angle annular dark-field (LAADF) images were acquired at 5 degree tilts with a pixel resolution of 0.19 nm and beam convergence angle of 7 mrad to provide a large depth of field. Image stacks were manually aligned using the TOMVIZ program. A model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm\n\n,\n\nwas used to perform HAADF and bright-field reconstruction. The image shift and tilt alignments were fine tuned using a multi-scale grid search approach based on fiducial particles identified in the reconstruction. Further, a segmentation algorithm was developed to segment out the particles in the reconstruction to reduce artefacts and improve the reconstruction of the low contrast carbon support. All the developments were performed in Python. Segmentation and visualization of the reconstructions was performed in the Avizo software. XPS data were collected on a PHI Quantera spectrometer, using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1,486.6 eV) and a low energy flood gun as neutralizer. All XPS spectra were calibrated by shifting the detected carbon C 1\ns\npeak to 284.6 eV. X-ray diffraction data were obtained on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer. The N\n\nadsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded on an ASAP 2020 accelerated surface area and porosimetry instrument (Micromeritics), equipped with automated surface area, at 77 K using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller calculations for the surface area. The mesopore and micropore size distribution plots were obtained from the isotherm based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model and non-local density functional theory model, respectively. Raman scattering spectra were obtained by using a Renishaw System 2000 spectrometer using the 514.5 nm line of an Ar\n+\nlaser for excitation. Inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry data were recorded on an Optima 7300 DV instrument.\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy tests and data analysis\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were performed at the Soft X-ray Microcharacterization Beamline (SXRMB) of the Canadian Light Source and the beamline 1W1B station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility in China. Metal foils, metal oxides and other standard samples as the references were from the beamlines or our previous work\n\n. The acquired EXAFS data were extracted and processed according to the standard procedures using the ATHENA module implemented in the IFEFFIT software packages. The k\n\n-weighted EXAFS spectra were obtained by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step. Subsequently, k\n\n-weighted\nχ\n(\nk\n) data in the k-space were Fourier transformed to real space using Hanning windows to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. χ(k) is defined as a function of wave vector k.\n\nPreparation of the electrodes\nTypically, 40 mg catalyst, 4 ml of 2-proponal (Sigma Aldrich) and 160 µl of Nafion binder solution (Sigma, 5%) were mixed together and sonicated for 20 min to obtain a homogeneous ink. Then, the prepared ink was air-brushed onto 5 × 5 cm\n\nSigracet 28 BC gas diffusion layer (Fuel Cell Store) electrodes until the desired catalyst loading was achieved."

(e)\n3 4\nXPS survey spectra and N-doping contents of the sample obtained at 800 oC via the\none-stage (UHDNi–N–C SACs) and two-stage pyrolysis methods.\nTo further experimentally demonstrate the critical role of CDs-induced confined\npyrolysis towards high N-dopants, we conducted control experiments based on a two-\nstage technology. In the first stage, urea undergoes condensation to form g-C N . In the\n3 4\nsecond stage, mixtures of CDs, NiCl and thiourea are pyrolyzed to obtain carbon-based\n\nmaterials. As such, the bonding interactions between g-C N and CDs-constructed\n3 4\ncarbon support are avoided. Remarkably, the typical out-of-plane sp3 C-N (located at\nca. 286.5 eV) bonding bahevior8,9 is observed during the preparation of UHDNi–N–C\nSACs. However, in stark contrast, the sp3 C–N bonding behavior is absent in the two-\nstage pyrolysis process (as expected). Benefiting from this, the total N content of the\nproducts obtained after 800 oC in the two-stage pyrolysis is as low as 8.0 at%, which is\nonly 30.7 % of the value for UHDNi–N–C SACs (26.1 at%). Based on the above\n\nsynthesis of UHDM-N-C SACs, and thus leads to the confined pyrolysis towards\nachieving a high N-doping level.\nSupplementary (a) XRD patterns, (b) XPS spectra, (c) variation of the total N-\ndoping content of the samples prepared at 800 oC without adding urea (no/UHDNi–N–\nC SACs), with 12.5 % (12.5 %/UHDNi–N–C SACs) or 25 % (25 %/UHDNi–N–C\nSACs) amount of urea used to prepare UHDNi–N–C SACs.\n\nexperimental results together with the\ntheoretical investigations evidenced that constructing N-doped carbons with very high\n\nexperimental results suggest that competing\n3 2\natomization and sintering processes occur when the N-doping content in the carbon support\nis low. In the situation where the N-doping content is not enough, the competing metal\nsintering reaction dominates the atom migration pathway, distinct from the case in the\n\npreparation of UHDNi–N–C SACs where N-dopant sites are abundant.\nSupplementary Ni atom loading versus N-doping content in the carbon support.\nError bars indicate standard deviations based on five ICP-OES tests. Data are presented as\nmean metal loading values with error bars, which indicate standard deviations of five\nindependent experimental results.\nSupplementary (a) and (b) Photographs showing the three-electrode cell used for\nOER tests in this work.

However,\nwhen further increased to 1000 oC, such a high temperature inevitably leads to the\ndissociation of N-doping species, such as Pyridine-N, Graphite-N and Pyridine-N.\nBecause of this, the Ni atoms should detach form these pre-formed Ni-N -C sites\n\nwithout anchoring effect and they thus thermodynamically reaggregate into metal\nparticles, mainly due to their high surface free energy. These results suggest that the\nstructure of isolated Ni atom can be maintained to 900 oC.\nSupplementary Atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM images of UHDNi–N–C\nSACs after heating at 900 oC, evidencing the highly dispersed isolated Ni atoms.\nSupplementary S 2p XPS spectrum for UHDNi–N–C SACs.\nSupplementary S L-edge XANES spectrum of UHDNi–N–C SACs.\nNo peaks associated with C-S-C (typically around 167 eV3) or metal-S bonds (ca. 174\nand 183 eV3) were detected, indicating that there is negligible S-doping into the carbon\nframework.\nSupplementary XRD characterization of the intermediates during the pyrolytic\nprocess of UHDTi–N–C SACs, showing the generation of a Ti S phase and then its\n1.08 2\ngradual decomposition.\nWith heating to around 650 °C, the two obvious and diffraction peaks\nassociated with the interplanar packing of s-triazine units and π-π interlayer stacking4-7\nof g-C N , were observed. Results confirm the successive trasformation of melon to\n3 4\npolymeric g-C N . During this process, peaks due to Ti S species also emerged. As\n3 4 1.08 2\nthe temperature was gradually increased to 700 oC, the g-C N continously decomposed\n3 4\nand a graphitic peak located at ca. 25 o appeared, indicating the generation of a\nN-doped carbon support. Apart from this, it is interesting to observe that the peak of\nTi S finally vanished. Also, no any peaks of Ti-containing species were observed at\n1.08 2\n700 oC or 800 oC. These obove discussions suggest the possible conversion of Ti S\n1.08 2\nphase to Ti single atoms.\nSupplementary Note 5 DFT ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations\n(Supplementary Figs. 66-71) were used to model the transition of M S nanoparticles\nx y\nto M–N –C sites, where the green, yellow, blue and grey spheres represent metal, S, N\n\nand C atoms, respectively. The DFT calculations indicate that it requires energy input\nto release a metal atom from the M S particle. However, once the removed metal atom\nx y\nis captured by N sites in the carbon support, the energy of the total reaction system can\n\nbe significantly reduced. As a consequence, our DFT analyses suggest that the M S\nx y\nnanoparticle-to-metal atom conversion is thermodynamically favored. The AIMD\ndynamics simulations also indicate the driving force in the atomization process is the\npotential energy decrease associated with forming a M–N –C moiety versus that of a\n\nmetal atom and N -containing vacancy defect.\n\nSupplementary Theoretical prediction and potential energy evolution from the\nAIMD dynamic simulation for UHDNi–N–C SACs, suggesting a Ni atom released\nfrom NiS is trapped by N-dopants to form Ni–N –C site.\n\nSupplementary Theoretical prediction and potential energy evolution from the\nAIMD dynamic simulation for UHDCo–N–C SACs, suggesting the dynamic\ndissociation of Co atom from bulk CoS and then trapped by N-dopants to form Co–\n\nN –C site.\n\nSupplementary Theoretical prediction and potential energy evolution from the\nAIMD dynamic simulation for UHDCu–N–C SACs, suggesting a Cu atom released\nfrom bulk Cu S is trapped by N-dopants to form a Cu–N –C site.\n7.2 4 4\nSupplementary Theoretical prediction and potential energy evolution from the\nAIMD dynamic simulation for UHDPt–N–C, suggesting the dynamic dissociation of\nPt atom from bulk PtS and then trapped by N-dopants to form Pt–N –C site.\n\nSupplementary Theoretical prediction and potential energy evolution from the\nAIMD dynamic simulation for UHDTi–N–C SACs, suggesting a Ti atom released from\nbulk Ti S is trapped by N-dopants to form a Ti–N –C site.\n1.08 2 4\nSupplementary Theoretical prediction and potential energy evolution from the\nAIMD dynamic simulation for UHDZn–N–C SACs, suggesting the dynamic\ndissociation of Zn atom from bulk ZnS and then trapped by N-dopants to form Zn–N –\n\nC site.\nSupplementary Note 6 Results of verified experiments shown in Supplementary Figs.\n72-75, demonstrating the critical roles of NiS nanoparticle decomposition and Ni atom\ncapture by the ultrahigh N-doped carbon support in realizing ultrahigh loadings of\nisolated Ni atoms.\nSupplementary XRD patterns of the samples prepared at 800 oC without\nadding thiourea and CDs.\nThe XRD pattern shows that Ni metal nanoparticles were produced in the absence of S\nsource, and that the Ni nanoparticles did not decompose to Ni atoms with heating. As a\nresult, carbon-supported Ni nanoparticles were obtained. These experimental results\nhighlight the indispensable functions of thermally-driven M S decomposition and the\nx y\nrelease of metal atoms in the particle-to-single atom conversion process to obtain highly\ndispersed Ni single atoms. In the presence of thiourea but absence of CDs, Ni S was\n3 2\nthe pyrolysis product.\nSupplementary (a) Schematic diagram showing a two-stage pyrolytic process.\nIn this strategy, urea is placed in the first stage, and a mixture of CDs, NiCl and thiourea\n\nare placed in the second stage, with the pyrolytic condition being similar to that for the\n\npreparation of UHDNi–N–C SACs.

(e)\n3 4\nXPS survey spectra and N-doping contents of the sample obtained at 800 oC via the\none-stage (UHDNi–N–C SACs) and two-stage pyrolysis methods.\nTo further experimentally demonstrate the critical role of CDs-induced confined\npyrolysis towards high N-dopants, we conducted control experiments based on a two-\nstage technology. In the first stage, urea undergoes condensation to form g-C N . In the\n3 4\nsecond stage, mixtures of CDs, NiCl and thiourea are pyrolyzed to obtain carbon-based\n\nmaterials. As such, the bonding interactions between g-C N and CDs-constructed\n3 4\ncarbon support are avoided. Remarkably, the typical out-of-plane sp3 C-N (located at\nca. 286.5 eV) bonding bahevior8,9 is observed during the preparation of UHDNi–N–C\nSACs. However, in stark contrast, the sp3 C–N bonding behavior is absent in the two-\nstage pyrolysis process (as expected). Benefiting from this, the total N content of the\nproducts obtained after 800 oC in the two-stage pyrolysis is as low as 8.0 at%, which is\nonly 30.7 % of the value for UHDNi–N–C SACs (26.1 at%). Based on the above\ndiscussions, these results clearly demonstrate the critical role of the bonding interaction\nbetween g-C N intermediate and CDs-induced carbon support during the pyrolysis\n3 4\n\nsynthesis of UHDM-N-C SACs, and thus leads to the confined pyrolysis towards\nachieving a high N-doping level.\nSupplementary (a) XRD patterns, (b) XPS spectra, (c) variation of the total N-\ndoping content of the samples prepared at 800 oC without adding urea (no/UHDNi–N–\nC SACs), with 12.5 % (12.5 %/UHDNi–N–C SACs) or 25 % (25 %/UHDNi–N–C\nSACs) amount of urea used to prepare UHDNi–N–C SACs.\n\nIt is obviously shown that Ni S phases were always detected in the situation of relative\n3 2\nlow N-doping content below 20 at%. These experimental results together with the\ntheoretical investigations evidenced that constructing N-doped carbons with very high\nN contents should been critically important for triggerring the metal sulfide particles\ninto highly loaded Ni–N coordinated single atoms, matching well with the discussions\nin the Introduction section.\nSupplementary XRD patterns analyzing the intermediate species variation during\nthe pyrolysis in 600, 700 and 800 oC for the samples with 25 % addition of melamine\nrelative to that of UHDNi–N–C SACs.\nGenerally, although the peak strength of NiS intermediate decreased to some extent as the\ntemperature increased (Supplementary , suggesting the decomposition of partial\nNiS particles, there was a lack of sufficient N dopants to stabilize the Ni atoms and they\nthus reaggregated into Ni S particles. These experimental results suggest that competing\n3 2\natomization and sintering processes occur when the N-doping content in the carbon support\nis low. In the situation where the N-doping content is not enough, the competing metal\nsintering reaction dominates the atom migration pathway, distinct from the case in the\n\npreparation of UHDNi–N–C SACs where N-dopant sites are abundant.\nSupplementary Ni atom loading versus N-doping content in the carbon support.\nError bars indicate standard deviations based on five ICP-OES tests. Data are presented as\nmean metal loading values with error bars, which indicate standard deviations of five\nindependent experimental results.\nSupplementary (a) and (b) Photographs showing the three-electrode cell used for\nOER tests in this work.

For all the OER measurements in this work, the distance\n2 2\nbetween working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode was ca. 2 cm.

A brief discussion about the key intermediates during CO RR.\n\nIn general, the pathway leading to both ethylene and ethanol generation remains\nidentical until the formation of the OCHCH intermediate, which is possibly adsorbed\n\nin two manners: one is the O-terminal adsorption (*OCHCH ) and the other is the C-\n\nterminal adsorption (*CH CHO)4-9.

Therefore, we focused on the O-\nterminal adsorption configuration of *OCHCH for the relevant DFT calculations.\n\nTypically, the production of C H OH and C H from CO follows the *OCHCH\n2 5 2 4 2 2\nintermediate, which undergoes symmetric hydrogenation to decompose directly into\n*O and C H , and subsequent transformation from *O to *OH and OH-.

This approach not only\n2 x y 3 z\nfacilitates controlled precipitation of Pr and Cu species in desired ratios, but also allows\n\nmanipulation of the stacking pattern of Pr and Cu precipitates by adjusting the addition\nstrategy of these two precipitants to induce the formation of a homogeneous Pr-Cu\nstructure.\nDecarbonation and dehydration of the Pr-Cu precursor and dispersion of the Cu\nspecies are achieved by calcination, which involve the application of a co-calcination\n(Supplementary and a stepwise calcination step and Supplementary\n. It is evident that in a co-calcination step (Supplementary , Pr and Cu\nare mutually dispersed at an atomic level as Pr(III)-O-Cu(II), weakening the\ncoordination of Cu-Cu. Consequently, the insufficiently surrounded Pr(IV) hindered\nthe migration of O2- near the Cu atoms, thus reducing the ability to form oxygen\nvacancies near the Pr(III)-O-Cu(II) sites. In contrast, the stepwise calcination method\nexhibits unique effects on the dispersion of the Cu species and Supplementary\n. In particular, the homogeneous Pr-Cu precursor obtained by co-precipitation\ncan form the Pr O -Cu-CS catalyst with Cu atoms dispersed atomically in the Pr O\n6 11 6 11\nlattice; the heterogeneous Pr-Cu precursor obtained by stepwise precipitation can\ngenerate the Pr O -Cu-SS catalyst with abundant Pr-Cu heterointerfaces. It indicates\n6 11\nthat the secondary calcination step further suppresses the formation of Pr-Cu composite\noxide (such as Pr CuO and PrCuO ), especially at the heterointerface. This enables the\n2 4 2\npreservation of Cu-Cu synergy and enhances the polarity near the heterointerface to\ninduce the formation of more O vacancy sites.\nSimilar structural evolutions were observed in other RE-Cu catalysts during the\nsame synthesis processes as Pr-Cu catalysts, wherein the precipitation and calcination\nbehaviors significantly influenced the CO RR performance. Different Ce-Cu and Nd-\n\nCu catalysts synthesized by the abovementioned methods were used as typical\nexamples to compare their structures and their corresponding CO RR performances. In\n\ndetail, the Ce-Cu catalysts synthesized by different methods exhibited nanostructures\nas atomically dispersed Cu in CeO (CeO -Cu-CS, Supplementary ,\n2 2\npolycrystalline CeO and CuO with a disordered distribution (CeO -Cu-SC,\n2 2\nSupplementary as well as coexisting CuO and CeO with heterointerfaces\n\n(CeO -Cu-SS, Supplementary . The Nd-Cu catalysts synthesized by different\n\nmethods exhibited nanostructures as atomically dispersed Cu in Nd O (Nd O -Cu-CS,\n2 3 2 3\nSupplementary , coexisted Nd O and Nd CuO composite oxide (Nd O -\n2 3 2 4 2 3\nCu-SC, Supplementary and coexisted CuO and Nd O with rich\n2 3\nheterointerfaces (Nd\n\nO\n\n-Cu-SS, Supplementary . Furthermore, as shown in\nSupplementary , the CO RR performance test revealed that the CeO -Cu-SS\n2 2\nand Nd O -Cu-SS catalysts synthesized by the stepwise precipitation and stepwise\n2 3\ncalcination method achieved the highest efficiency for multi-carbon products (60.6%\nat 50.0%) compared to those synthesized by the other two methods. These results\ndemonstrated that the stepwise precipitation-stepwise calcination strategy is universal\nfor the preparation of RE-Cu catalysts with similar heterostructures and can enhance\nthe CO RR performance. Among them, the as-synthesized Pr-Cu catalyst exhibited\n\nunique structural features that significantly affected the product selectivity of CO RR.\n\nSupplementary Note 3. A brief discussion about the key intermediates during CO RR.\n\nIn general, the pathway leading to both ethylene and ethanol generation remains\nidentical until the formation of the OCHCH intermediate, which is possibly adsorbed\n\nin two manners: one is the O-terminal adsorption (*OCHCH ) and the other is the C-\n\nterminal adsorption (*CH CHO)4-9. Taking insights into these adsorption\n\nconfigurations and corresponding reaction pathway (Supplementary , only the\n*OCHCH structure can lead to a combined production of ethanol and ethylene via the\n\nsubsequent C=C double bond hydrogenation, while the reaction pathway involving the\n*CH CHO structure cannot efficiently deliver the ethylene production which is not\n\nconsistent with the experimental results . Therefore, we focused on the O-\nterminal adsorption configuration of *OCHCH for the relevant DFT calculations.\n\nTypically, the production of C H OH and C H from CO follows the *OCHCH\n2 5 2 4 2 2\nintermediate, which undergoes symmetric hydrogenation to decompose directly into\n*O and C H , and subsequent transformation from *O to *OH and OH-. In contrast, the\n2 4\npathway for C H OH production from *OCHCH requires multiple selective\n2 5 2\nhydrogenation steps to produce the intermediates *OCHCH , *OCH CH ,\n3 2 3\n*HOCH CH and C H OH.\n2 3 2 5\n\nSupplementary Note 4. A detailed discussion about the O formation energy analysis.\n\nvac\nUsing the pure Pr O surface as a reference, we investigated the state of surface\n6 11\nO by calculating the O formation energy, as shown in ,i. For pure Pr O ,\nvac vac 6 11\nthe holes formed by the surface Pr atoms are not fully covered by O atoms, resulting in\nthe formation of intrinsic surface O sites. Therefore, the further generated O can\nvac vac\nbe generally categorized into two kinds , including the O sites adjacent to\nvac\nthe intrinsic O (O 1) and the O sites far from the intrinsic O (O 2), which\nvac vac vac vac vac\nexhibited O formation energies of -0.649 and -0.685 eV, respectively . The\nvac\nPr O -O model exhibited an O formation energy of 0.321 eV, which is still low\n6 11 vac34 vac\nenough for continued O formation under mild experimental conditions. After Cu was\nvac\nloaded onto this model, the ideal Pr\n\nO\n\n-O\nvac34\n-Cu model showed an O\nvac\nformation\nenergy of 0.765 eV, which is attributed to the formation of Cu-O bonds that stabilize\nthe surface O atoms. Nevertheless, this increment is still relatively modest compared to\nenergy barriers for chemical reactions at room temperature (0.75~1 eV), allowing for\nfurther formation of surface O\nvac\n. The O\nvac\nformation energies of Pr\n\nO\n\n-O\nvac52\n-Cu and\nPr O -O -Cu with much higher O concentrations were 1.230 eV and 1.596 eV,\n6 11 vac62 vac\nrespectively, which exceed those of the aforementioned models (>1 eV), suggesting\nthat a high concentration of O could be formed and is relatively stable during the\nvac\nCO\n\nRR process.\n\nSupplementary Note 5. A detailed discussion about the Bader charge and PDOS\nanalyses.\nAs shown in , the Cu atoms loaded on the surface of Pr O exhibited\n6 11\ndifferent properties from those at the interface. The surface Cu atoms showed almost\nno charge gain or loss (-0.017 and -0.036 e), approaching the property of metallic Cu,\nwhereas the interface Cu atoms underwent a greater charge depletion compared to those\non the surface. It suggests that the formation of Cu0/Cuδ+ structure is favored by the\nbonding between interface Cu atoms and surface O atoms of the Pr O -O substrate,\n6 11 vac\nwhich is consistent with the experimental findings (Figs. 3, 4 and Supplementary . Within the Cu0/Cuδ+ structure, the properties of interface Cu differed significantly\nfrom those of the surface Cu and changed with the O concentrations (0.178 e in\nvac\nPr O -O -Cu and 0.138 e in Pr O -O -Cu). Therefore, it can be inferred that the\n6 11 vac52 6 11 vac62\nactive region of the Pr\n\nO\n\n-Cu-SS catalyst is primarily located at the interface.\nThe projected density of state (PDOS) distributions for pure Cu, Pr O -O -Cu\n6 11 vac52\nand Pr O -O -Cu were calculated and shown in Supplementary \n6 11\natoms exhibited a broader d-orbital energy distribution (a more delocalized d-orbital\nenergy distribution) and possessed more states at the Fermi level.

For the CeO system, the Bader charge of interfacial Cu in the CeO -O -Cu\n2 2 vac41\nmodel was 0.122 e, indicating the formation of interfacial Cu0/Cuδ+ structures. However,\nthe XPS analysis revealed that the surface O concentration of CeO -Cu was lower\nvac 2\nthan that of Pr O -Cu (Supplementary and Supplementary .\n6 11\nConsequently, although loading Cu on CeO can form a considerable Cu0/Cuδ+ active\n\ninterface, the corresponding free energy curves indicated that the ethylene pathway was\nnot effectively suppressed, resulting in a limited selectivity for ethanol production.\nUnlike CeO and Pr O , the O content in the perfect Nd O crystal is much lower\n2 6 11 2 3\n(Nd:O=2:3), and the interfacial O concentration of Nd O -Cu is not high\nvac 2 3\n(Supplementary and Supplementary , together resulting in less\ninterfacial O sites.

                "output": "synthesis procedure of Co\nCNCl/S is shown in \n. First, CoSO\n\n, dicyandiamide, glucose and sodium chloride (NaCl) were dissolved in water and then freeze dried to encapsulate Co ions and other molecules within NaCl crystal lattice. Afterwards, the resulting mixture was annealed at 900 °C in an argon atmosphere, leading to the carbonization of glucose to form a graphene network between the salt lattice to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) Co-SAC nanosheets–NaCl mixture. Notably, the size of NaCl increased during the high-temperature carbonization process, thereby expediting the formation of interpenetrating nanosheets at the boundaries of salt particles and securing a high carbon yield due to the confined carbonization between NaCl terminals. At annealing temperatures above the melting point of NaCl (801 °C), molten NaCl facilitated the capture of Cl by Co atoms, introducing Cl into the Co centre. Simultaneously, the thermal decomposition of CoSO\n\nreleased sulfur, which was spontaneously incorporated into the carbon matrix, creating long-range coordination with the Co single atoms. Following the removal of the NaCl template via acid washing (Supplementary \n), 3D honeycomb-like structures were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Co\n\nCNCl/S indicated the 3D honeycomb-like morphologies with interconnected open pores \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nsynthesis with 3D honeycomb-like morphology and single-atomic structures. As results, a series of nitrogen (N)-doped, S-doped and N–S co-doped carbon-based catalysts without or with Co single sites were synthesized by varying the added precursors of heteroatoms and Co salts (correspondingly denoted as CN, C/S, CN/S and Co\n\nCNCl; Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). Notably, the catalysts using the NaCl template for synthesis revealed 3D interconnected porous structures with a high Co content (2.09–2.66 wt.%), whereas the reference sample without NaCl (Co\n\nCN/S-w/o NaCl) exhibited compact structure and a low Co content (1.43 wt.%; Supplementary Figs.\n\nsynthesis, which not only encapsulated the ultrathin layers of glucose to construct highly porous materials but also constrained the carbonization process to prevent the aggregation of Co species for single-atom formation. Consequently, we provided a facile and mass-production strategy for Co\n\nCNCl/S\n\n) with a high carbon yield of 36.5%, well exceeding the yields by other synthesis methods\n\nExperimental conditions: phenol concentration 0.2 mM, PMS concentration 0.4 mM, catalyst concentration 0.05 g l\n−1\n.\n\nexperimental findings and theoretical computations, we propose a mechanism of non-radical pollutant oxidation via a 100% Co\n\nCNCl/S-mediated electron transfer process \n). The stable Co–N\n\nconfiguration, with the axial Cl coordination through short-range strong electronic coupling, enhances conductivity, while the high electronegativity of Cl renders the central Co atom more positively charged, facilitating the interaction and adsorption of electron-rich O atoms in PMS (negatively charged). The second-shell S, through medium-range weak interactions, further modifies the electron structure of Co, boosts the adsorption of PMS, and lowers the conductivity. Notably, the strategic co-coordination of axial Cl and the second-shell S at the active Co site causes an upward shift of non-bonding state near the Fermi level, featured by the\n\nsynthesis batches (Supplementary \n), underscoring its reproducibility and robustness. Interestingly, this well-defined bicoordinated Co\n\nCNCl/S catalyst exhibited superior activity in oxygen reduction reactions compared with single-coordinated catalysts (Supplementary \n), thereby opening possibilities for extending its application to other electrocatalytic redox systems.\n\nCNCl/S system.

We have achieved a 36.5% yield of SAC catalysts in a well-defined Co–N\n\ncentre with spontaneous axial Cl bonding and second-shell S doping. Both DFT calculations and experimental investigations indicated that the short-range (axial Cl) and medium-range (second-shell S) modification effectively regulate the electronic structures of CoN\n\n, realizing an ultrahigh TOF of 1.82 min\n−1\nfor pollutant oxidation. The in-plane S and spatial Cl doping collectively afford an upward non-bonding state near the Fermi level with a lower\n\nsynthesis at the molecular level and mechanistic insights of structure–activity relations of this work will not only enlighten the intelligent design of reaction-oriented single-atom materials for high intrinsic activity in green catalysis but also unlock their potential for practical applications in environmental remediation.\n\nPreparation of Co\nCNCl/S and other Co-based SACs\nNaCl (3 g), glucose (300 mg), CoSO\n\n·7H\n\nO (28.1 mg) and dicyandiamide (332 mg) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water and stirred continuously for 2 h. The resulting solution was freeze dried under vacuum to yield a powder, which was then ground in a mortar and pyrolysed at 900 °C for 2 h under an argon atmosphere, with a heating rate of 5 °C min\n−1\n. After cooling to room temperature, the black powder was subjected to acid etching with 0.5 M H\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s44221-024-00382-8\nSource: main text file\n\nThe synthesis procedure of Co\nCNCl/S is shown in \n. First, CoSO\n\n, dicyandiamide, glucose and sodium chloride (NaCl) were dissolved in water and then freeze dried to encapsulate Co ions and other molecules within NaCl crystal lattice. Afterwards, the resulting mixture was annealed at 900 °C in an argon atmosphere, leading to the carbonization of glucose to form a graphene network between the salt lattice to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) Co-SAC nanosheets–NaCl mixture. Notably, the size of NaCl increased during the high-temperature carbonization process, thereby expediting the formation of interpenetrating nanosheets at the boundaries of salt particles and securing a high carbon yield due to the confined carbonization between NaCl terminals. At annealing temperatures above the melting point of NaCl (801 °C), molten NaCl facilitated the capture of Cl by Co atoms, introducing Cl into the Co centre. Simultaneously, the thermal decomposition of CoSO\n\nreleased sulfur, which was spontaneously incorporated into the carbon matrix, creating long-range coordination with the Co single atoms. Following the removal of the NaCl template via acid washing (Supplementary \n), 3D honeycomb-like structures were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Co\n\nCNCl/S indicated the 3D honeycomb-like morphologies with interconnected open pores \nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n), resulting in a substantial surface area (312.7 m\n\ng\n−1\n). High resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) revealed that numerous isolated bright spots were dispersed on the matrix \n), demonstrating Co single atoms, which corroborates with the result from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; Supplementary \n). Moreover, S and Cl were successfully incorporated into the carbon matrix combined with isolated Co atoms, as demonstrated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; \nand Supplementary \n).\n\n, The synthesis scheme of Co\n\nCNCl/S.\n\nb\n–\nd\n, SEM (\nb\n) and HAADF-STEM (\nc\n) images of Co\n\nCNCl/S and the corresponding EDS mappings of C, N, Co, Cl and S (\nd\n).\ne\n, The digital image of 15 g Co\n\nCNCl/S catalysts.\nf\n\n, The catalyst yield with different synthesis methods (details provided in the\n\nSupplementary Information\n).

As results, a series of nitrogen (N)-doped, S-doped and N–S co-doped carbon-based catalysts without or with Co single sites were synthesized by varying the added precursors of heteroatoms and Co salts (correspondingly denoted as CN, C/S, CN/S and Co\n\nCNCl; Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). Notably, the catalysts using the NaCl template for synthesis revealed 3D interconnected porous structures with a high Co content (2.09–2.66 wt.%), whereas the reference sample without NaCl (Co\n\nCN/S-w/o NaCl) exhibited compact structure and a low Co content (1.43 wt.%; Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). This finding underscored the importance of NaCl in Co\n\nCNCl/S synthesis, which not only encapsulated the ultrathin layers of glucose to construct highly porous materials but also constrained the carbonization process to prevent the aggregation of Co species for single-atom formation. Consequently, we provided a facile and mass-production strategy for Co\n\nCNCl/S\n\n) with a high carbon yield of 36.5%, well exceeding the yields by other synthesis methods\n\nand Supplementary \n). Nevertheless, Co nanoparticles were observed without dicyandiamide in carbon matrix (Co\nx\nCCl/S), demonstrating the added N source also played a vital role in Co atom anchoring (Supplementary \n). Together, it can be concluded that the use of NaCl and dicyandiamide significantly determined the formation of the 3D honeycomb-like morphology and single-atom structure for Co-SACs.\nAtomic structure and coordination regulation of Co-SACs\nThe chemical composition and surface chemistry of the Co\n\nCNCl/S and controlled catalysts were explored. The Cl 2\np\nXPS spectra showed a higher binding energy shift in Co\n\nCNCl/S compared with Na–Cl (Supplementary \n). Combined with the imbalanced Na and Cl contents in SEM–EDS, the shift suggested that the increase in Cl intensity was due to the formation of Co–Cl bonds. In addition, the absence of characteristic peaks for metal–S bonds indicated that the exotic S atoms were primarily bonded with surrounding N or C atoms rather than directly with the central Co atom (Supplementary \n). The N 1\ns\nXPS spectra revealed distinct N species in these catalysts (Supplementary \n). Compared with Co\n\nCNCl, the Co–N peak for Co\n\nCNCl/S shifted to lower binding energy, implying partial electron transfer from the S to the N atom and subsequently to the central Co site\n\n. The categories of N species were also corroborated by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopic measurements. As shown in \n, the N K-edge XANES spectra of the catalysts were dominated by three well-resolved resonance peaks, attributed to pyridinic π*, pyrrolic π* and graphitic π* (\n). Compared with CN, the resonance of pyridinic N for Co\n\nCNCl showed a notable reduction. Meanwhile, slight shifts of pyridinic and pyrrolic N were further observed on Co\n\nCNCl/S. In particular, in the σ* region, S doping or Co anchoring resulted in a broader resonance profile compared with CN (Supplementary \n), which indicated the diverse lengths of C–N bonds. All these variations in the N K-edge XANES spectra demonstrated the alterations in the chemical environment of N atoms for Co\n\nCNCl/S due to the second-shell S doping, giving rise to the changed electronic configuration of Co metal centres.\n\nCNCl and Co\n\nCNCl/S.\nb\n,\nc\n, Co K-edge XANES spectra (\nb\n) and FT-EXAFS spectra (\nc\n) of Co\n\nCNCl/S, Co\n\nCNCl and reference samples.\nR\ndenotes radial distance.\nd\n, Co K-edge WT-EXAFS plots of Co\n\nCNCl and Co\n\nCNCl/S.\ne\n, The EXAFS analysis of Co\n\nCNCl/S in\nR\nspace.\nf\n, The formation energies of different coordination patterns for elemental S and Cl.\nSource data\nFull size image\nCo K-edge XANES spectroscopy was carried out to verify the atomic structure and coordination environment of Co atoms in Co\n\nCNCl/S. The rising edge of both Co\n\nCNCl and Co\n\nCNCl/S fell between those of CoO and Co foil \n), indicating that the predominant valence state of the single-atom Co lay between Co\n\nand Co\n2+\n, consistent with the XPS findings (Supplementary \n). The\nk\n\n-weighted Fourier transform of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) analysis revealed that the metallic Co–Co peak was not observed for Co\n\nCNCl and Co\n\nCNCl/S, confirming the structure of isolated Co sites \n), which was consistent with the STEM results. More importantly, unlike the reference (cobalt phthalocynine, CoPc) with a symmetrical peak of Co–N\n\ncoordination at 1.47 Å, the FT-EXAFS of Co\n\nCNCl/S exhibited a shifted, asymmetrical peak at 1.35 Å. This change was attributed primarily to the axial coordination of Co–Cl, resulting in the distortion of Co atoms positioning out of the graphene plane\n\n. These results were in line with the wavelet transform EXAFS (WT-EXAFS) analysis \nand Supplementary \n). In addition, the use of sulfate precursors in Co\n\nCNCl/S introduced S atoms into the carbon matrix. Based on XPS results (Supplementary \n) and the distinct peak observed around 2.33 Å in the\nR\nspace of Co\n\nCNCl/S in the EXAFS spectrum, which was absent in Co\n\nCNCl, S was probably incorporated into the second coordination shell of Co. Furthermore, the coordination environment of Co\n\nCNCl/S was resolved via quantitative EXAFS curve fitting (Supplementary \nand Supplementary \n–\n\n). The optimal EXAFS fitting analyses of Co\n\nCNCl/S confirmed that a Co centre was coordinated with Cl and N atoms at the numbers 0.7 and 4, respectively. However, the calculated distances of Co–Cl and Co–N bonds for Co\n\nCNCl were 2.26 Å and 1.86 Å, respectively (Supplementary \n), whereas those distances were 2.25 Å and 1.88 Å for Co\n\nCNCl/S \n), respectively. The changes in bond length on Co\n\nCNCl/S were attributed to the S coordination with N in the second shell, which was indicated by a Co–S path length of 2.95 Å. Furthermore, additional DFT calculations further validated the coordination structure of Co\n\nCNCl/S obtained from EXAFS curve fitting \nand Supplementary \n), where the configuration with axial Co–Cl coordination and S–N coordination in the second shell exhibited the lowest formation energy (−2.24 eV), consistent with the EXAFS analysis. Based on the above evidence, the Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\nconfiguration with a Co–Cl bond in the axial direction as well as planar Co–N\n\nand N–S bonds in the second shell were demonstrated in Co\n\nCNCl/S.\nFenton-like catalysis and mechanisms\nThe engineered Co-SACs were assessed in catalysing PMS activation for Fenton-like oxidation using phenol as a model pollutant. As shown in Supplementary \n, metal-free carbon catalysts of CN, C/S and CN/S achieved only 11.0%, 22.9% and 24.7% of phenol removal within 20 min, respectively, whereas the Co-SACs with four-N coordination (Co\n\nCN) achieved more than 42% degradation of phenol \n), indicating the high activity of Co single sites for PMS activation. Remarkably, a significantly boosted catalytic activity was achieved on Co\n\nCNCl/S, achieving complete pollutant decomposition within 5 min \n). Conversely, the low activity of Co\n\nCN/S-w/o NaCl can be attributed to the lack of a porous structure with hindered mass transfer and adsorption processes (Supplementary \n), significantly limiting phenol degradation as a surface reaction. The apparent rate constant (\nk\nobs\n) of Co\n\nCNCl/S (0.952 min\n−1\n) was 19.0, 10.1 and 8.7 times higher than that of Co\n\nCN, Co\n\nCNCl and Co\n\nCN/S, respectively, illustrating the vital importance of co-existing S and Cl coordination of single-atom sites for activity improvement (Supplementary \n). This strong coordination at the Co single site resulted in negligible Co²⁺ leaching at approximately 3.8 ppb, well below the emission standard (1.0 mg l\n−1\n, GB 25467–2010)\n\n. Such a low leaching level indicated a minimal contribution to PMS activation and secondary pollution (Supplementary \n). In addition, there was no linear relationship between\nk\nobs\nand Co content in different Co-SACs (Supplementary \n), demonstrating that the Co content was not the main factor for improving the PMS activation. Relying on this, the intrinsic activity of Co\n\nCNCl/S based on TOF was compared with previously reported nanostructured catalysts, including carbon-based metal-nanoparticle composites\n\n,\n\nand SACs\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n(Supplementary \n). Co\n\nCNCl/S with a TOF of 1.82 min\n−1\noutperformed most of the state-of-the-art nanocatalysts for Fenton-like reactions reported so far \n).

Experimental conditions: phenol concentration 0.2 mM, PMS concentration 0.4 mM, catalyst concentration 0.05 g l\n−1\n.\nSource data\nFull size image\nGiven the boosted catalytic performance of Co\n\nCNCl/S, we further assessed its reaction regimes in PMS-induced AOPs. Commonly, various reactive species have been identified in metal SAC-based AOPs, such as hydroxyl/sulfate radicals (\n•\nOH/ SO\n\n•−\n) (refs.\n\n,\n\n), single oxygen (\n\nO\n\n) (\n), surface-activated complexes (PMS*)\n\nand high-valence oxo-metal species\n\n. For these possible active species,\ntert\n-butyl alcohol can selectively quench\n•\nOH, whereas ethanol is usually used to scavenge both\n•\nOH and SO\n\n•−\n. As shown in Supplementary \n, these alcohols had no obvious inhibitory effect on catalytic activity. In addition, benzoic acid, as a radical probe for\n•\nOH/SO\n\n•−\n, could not be oxidized in this system either (Supplementary \n). More intuitively, radical trapping tests by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed that these two radicals could not be captured, and the seven-line signal of 5,5-dimethyl-2-pyrrolidone-\nN\n-oxyl was detected from a direct oxidation product of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-\nN\n-oxide (DMPO) \n). These results collectively indicated that\n•\nOH and SO\n\n•−\nwere not generated in the Co\n\nCNCl/S/PMS system. In addition, 2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-4-piperidinol (TEMP) as an\n\nO\n\nscavenger was introduced in Co\n\nCNCl/S/PMS to further investigate the possible contribution of\n\nO\n\n. No significant inhibitory effect on phenol degradation occurred when adding TEMP (Supplementary \n). The three-line spectrum as the featured TEMP oxidation product by\n\nO\n\nwas missing in EPR analysis \n). Moreover, controlled gas (from N\n\nto O\n\n) and water (from H\n\nO to D\n\nO) experiments also showed no influence on phenol degradation (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Therefore,\n\nO\n\ngeneration was excluded from either PMS or dissolved oxygen. In addition, methyl phenyl sulfoxide did not significantly inhibit phenol degradation by Co\n\nCNCl/S (Supplementary \n), excluding the contribution of high-valence metal species in the Co\n\nCNCl/S/PMS system. Other catalysts were also investigated in the quenching tests (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n), where most of the catalysts primarily mediated a non-radical reaction (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n) while C/S and Co\nx\nCCl/S without N coordination produced radical species (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). These observations suggested that N coordination in the microenvironment of Co-SACs was conducive to enabling the interactions with PMS to mediate non-radical oxidation processes, which was consistent with reported studies\n\n,\n\n.\nGiven the excluded active species, we speculated that PMS was activated to form PMS* to oxidize phenol through an ETP. To validate this deduction, we constructed a dual-compartment galvanic oxidation setup (Supplementary \n). As expected, the Co\n\nCNCl/S-coated reactor showed a significantly increased current (218 μA), achieving 80.6% phenol oxidation within 10 h. This soundly supported the ETP regime accounting for phenol oxidation via charge transfer from phenol to PMS over Co\n\nCNCl/S. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was used to monitor ETP for the catalyst–PMS system in real time \nand Supplementary \n). As shown in Supplementary \n, PMS displayed the characteristic peaks of HSO\n\n−\nat around 889 and 1,063 cm\n−1\n, along with the peak of SO\n\n2−\nat 984 cm\n−1\n(refs.\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). In the Co\n\nCNCl/S/PMS system, in addition to the peaks of HSO\n\n−\n, a new peak was observed at around 820 cm\n−1\nafter adding PMS \n), corresponding to the activated PMS* (\n). As the reaction progressed, the peak of PMS* gradually intensified, but it disappeared instantly upon the addition of phenol. In addition, corresponding findings were also observed and identified from in situ synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared (SR-FTIR) spectra ,g\n). If Co\n\nCNCl/S was adopted, red shifts of S–O and S=O bands were observed, indicating that the HO–OSO\n\n−\nstructure was bonded to the surface of Co\n\nCNCl/S\n\n. Upon phenol addition, the red-shifted bonds reverted because of the redox reactions between surface-confined PMS* and phenol \n). Together, all the band changes on SERS and FTIR spectra indicated the ETP process: surface-confined PMS* was formed through electronic coupling between Co\n\nCNCl/S and adsorbed PMS initially (denoted as Co\n\nCNCl/S-PMS*); the generated Co\n\nCNCl/S-PMS* captured electrons from the electron donor (in this case, phenol), causing PMS decomposition and phenol oxidation. Therefore, the Co\n\nCNCl/S-PMS* served as the active species for phenol oxidation. ETP was typically preceded by the formation of the surface-confined PMS* as the active species, which created a micro-high-potential regime resembling anodic oxidation.\nUnderstanding the kinetics of ETP during PMS activation necessitates a closer examination of three critical parameters: PMS adsorption, the potential of catalyst–PMS* complexes and their variations. Accordingly, a PMS adsorption capacity (\nQ\nPMS\n) on catalysts was first explored and compared (Supplementary \n). For metal-free catalysts, the\nQ\nPMS\nwas generally low, consistent with the poor degradation efficiency due to the limited availability of active sites and weak interactions of N-doped carbon with PMS via van der Waals force\n\n. By contrast, the PMS adsorption on Co-SACs was significantly enhanced, along with the boosted\nk\nobs\n. In particular, Co\n\nCNCl/S exhibited the highest\nQ\nPMS\ncompared with Co\n\nCN, Co\n\nCN/S and Co\n\nCNCl, which demonstrated that the axial Cl and the second-shell S dual coordination can remarkably promote PMS adsorption, resulting in a high population of surface-confined and activated PMS.\nThe open circuit potential (OCP) of the catalysts during reaction was then assessed to reflect the potential of the catalyst–PMS* (Supplementary \n). For a blank glassy carbon electrode, the slightly increased OCP did not change after adding phenol. However, the OCP of Co\n\nCNCl/S swiftly rose after the addition of PMS, levelling off to an equilibrium potential (denoted as\nφ\n) at around +0.890 V (versus Ag/AgCl), and then sharply fell upon phenol addition. This variation of potential demonstrated the formation of the Co\n\nCNCl/S-PMS* complex, which was consumed with phenol via the following redox processes. Notably, the\nφ\nof Co\n\nCNCl/S-PMS* and the value of potential drop (defined as Δ\nφ\n) after oxidation were both greater than those in Co\n\nCN, Co\n\nCN/S and Co\n\nCNCl, implying that the Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S configuration was more favourable to create highly oxidative domains via forming populated and strongly interacting catalyst–PMS* complexes.\nBased on the above results, four Co-SACs are comprehensively compared in \nin terms of\nk\nobs\n,\nk\nobs\nnormalized by Co content (denoted as\nk\nper Co\n), TOF,\nQ\nPMS\n,\nφ\nand Δ\nφ\n. Clearly, Co\n\nCNCl/S exhibited all the highest values of the parameters. Thus, the axial Cl and second-shell S coordination tailored the Co single site and regulated the intrinsic PMS activation efficiency via enhancing PMS adsorption and generating the reactive PMS* complexes with regional elevated potential, ultimately accelerating the oxidation kinetics of co-adsorbed organics via electron transfer.\nTheoretical calculation\nTo explore the impact of different Co coordination configurations on Fenton-like catalysis, we investigated their intrinsic properties using DFT calculations. We first constructed four single-atom structures, Co–N\n\n, Co–N\n\n–S\n\n, Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\nand Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\n(corresponding to Co\n\nCN, Co\n\nCN/S, Co\n\nCNCl and Co\n\nCNCl/S, respectively; Supplementary \n). The projected density of states (PDOS; \n) of Co–N\n\nshowed that there were no obvious electronic states near the Fermi level, revealing typical semiconductor characteristics. Upon axial Cl coordination to Co, distinct electronic states emerged near the Fermi level, signifying that the axially coordinated Cl promoted the enhancement of conductivity. With the second-shell S coordination, a pronounced pseudo-energy gap appeared near the Fermi level, suggesting the rearrangement of the electronic structure, leading to the formation of stronger covalent bonds. Unfortunately, the missing electronic states near the Fermi level led to a restriction of electronic conduction in this energy range and, hence, lower conductivity. Notably, the PDOS of Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\nsuggested that this coordination configuration highlighted the advantages of the axial Cl and the second-shell layer S. Specifically, the obvious electronic state near the Fermi level enhanced the conductivity of Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\n, while the non-bonded state near the Fermi level was also significantly shifted upwards. These were supported by the electrochemical impedance spectra (Supplementary \n) showing that Co\n\nCNCl/S had a superior charge-transfer capacity, while Co\n\nCNCl with axial Cl exceeded Co\n\nCN/S and Co\n\nCN.\n\n, Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n, Co–N\n\n–S\n\nand Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\n.\nb\n, The\nd\n-band centre of Co–N\n\n, Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n, Co–N\n\n–S\n\nand Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\nbefore and after adsorption of PMS.\nc\n, Adsorption energy with PMS and the corresponding\nk\nobs\n.\nd\n, pCOHP between the central Co atom and the O atom as PMS adsorption. Corresponding IpCOHP values and Co–O bond lengths are shown in the figures.\ne\n, A schematic diagram of the Fenton-like reaction for Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\n.\nSource data\nFull size image\nGiven the pivotal role of PMS adsorption as the initial step in non-radical ETP, the\nd\n-band centres (\nε\nd\n) of the four models before and after adsorption of PMS were calculated \nand Supplementary \n). Our results demonstrated that, compared with other three models, the\nd\n-band centre of Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\nshifted towards the Fermi level (−1.49 eV) owing to the coexistence of the second-shell S and axial Cl \n). This coupling concentrated the\nd\n-electron distribution at the energy levels near the Fermi level and promoted the adsorption and interaction with PMS at the Co site on Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\n(Supplementary \n). In addition, after binding with PMS, the\nd\n-band centre of the Co atom in Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\nmoved the furthest away from the Fermi level compared with three other coordination models (Co–N\n\n, Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\nand Co–N\n\n–S\n\n), with the\nd\n-band centre dropping to −1.95 eV. Therefore, the coexistence of the second-shell S and axial Cl facilitated PMS adsorption and desorption, effectively accelerating Fenton-like catalysis. We further conducted investigations into the PMS adsorption energy (\nE\nads\n) onto different catalysts (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). The computed results established the following order of PMS adsorption capacities: Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\n> Co–N\n\n–S\n\n> Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n> Co–N\n\n, consistent with the trend of\nk\nobs\n\n). This demonstrated that the individual coordination of axial Cl and second-shell S led to a stabilized increase in adsorption energy, favouring PMS adsorption. Moreover, co-introduction of axial Cl and second-shell S facilitated strong adsorption of PMS molecules on the Co site to form an activated surface complex, aligning with the\nd\n-band results.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that the reaction kinetics of catalysts are highly sensitive to the spin configuration\n\n,\n\n. In this work, only the simultaneous coordination of axial Cl and second-shell S (Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\n) exerted a synergistic impact on Co spin orbital filling, leading to a significant change in the filling of the\ne\ng\norbitals of Co 3\nd\nin the\nd\nz\n\ndirection (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\nand Supplementary \n). In addition, analysing charge-transfer energy revealed a heightened propensity for electron migration from the Co centre to the PMS molecule in Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\n(Supplementary \n), enhancing its potential in catalysing PMS activation to form a reactive intermediate.\nThe projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) was used to analyse the bond strength between the central Co atom and the O atom in the peroxide O–O bond during PMS adsorption. Clearly, with the dual coordination of the second-shell S and axial Cl, the absolute value of the integrated pCOHP (IpCOHP) increased (−1.80 eV; \n), indicating a stronger Co–O bond with PMS, leading to more stable surface intermediates (catalyst–PMS*). The changes in bond length and bond strength were consistent with a positive linear relationship (Supplementary \n). A shorter Co–O bond length (1.99 Å) implied a stronger interaction between the central Co atom and PMS, consistent with the PMS adsorption (Supplementary \n). Furthermore, the charge density difference and the average distribution analysis showed a substantial increase in charge density around Cl, resulting in an overall downward shift of adsorption oscillations (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). Hence, by virtue of the augmented catalytic activity of the dual-engineered Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\nsite, it harboured intensified capacities for both binding with PMS and mediating a local redox process for PMS activation. This caused an uplifted potential per unit of PMS in the activated state, thereby improving the oxidation capacity and accelerating the reaction kinetics upon reacting with organic pollutants.\nDrawing upon both experimental findings and theoretical computations, we propose a mechanism of non-radical pollutant oxidation via a 100% Co\n\nCNCl/S-mediated electron transfer process \n). The stable Co–N\n\nconfiguration, with the axial Cl coordination through short-range strong electronic coupling, enhances conductivity, while the high electronegativity of Cl renders the central Co atom more positively charged, facilitating the interaction and adsorption of electron-rich O atoms in PMS (negatively charged). The second-shell S, through medium-range weak interactions, further modifies the electron structure of Co, boosts the adsorption of PMS, and lowers the conductivity. Notably, the strategic co-coordination of axial Cl and the second-shell S at the active Co site causes an upward shift of non-bonding state near the Fermi level, featured by the\nd\n-band centre located in proximity to the Fermi level. This configuration not only intensifies PMS adsorption but also enhances the charge migration capacity of the SAC substrate to coordinate ETP. In this bicoordinated structure, the optimal PMS adsorption site (H–O\n(I)\n–O\n(II)\n–SO\n3(III)\n) was the terminal O\nIII\natom (at the S–O bond), which binds with the active Co site with axial Cl, enabling the electron transfer from the co-adsorbed organic compounds, facilitated by the second-shell S atom with both electron-donating and adsorption functions. This pathway differs from PMS-mediated\n\nO\n\nand radical generation, where metal sites bind the peroxy O\nII\nor terminal O\nIII\natom of PMS with hydrogen-coupled electron transfer to form surface-confined O* or SO\n\n* intermediates that further couple to form high-energy\n\nO\n\n(refs.\n\n,\n\n) or metal sites bond with peroxy O\nII\nand hydroxy O\nI\natoms with strong electron transfer and PMS dissociation, thus generating radical species such as\n•\nOH and SO\n\n•−\n(\n). These pathways required the metal sites with high electron density to ensure the strong redox processes that spontaneously dissociate PMS into O* or radicals. By contrast, the spatial and second-shell coordination of the Co centre strengthens Co–O bonds and electronic interactions with PMS, exceeding the van der Waals force of the carbon matrix and preventing instant PMS dissociation due to the optimized charge density of the Co site\n\n. Thus, the shortened O–O bond in Co\n\nCNCl/S-activated PMS resulted in the formation of a more stable and high-potential PMS* complex to coordinate the ETP regime. Once the complex potential surpasses the oxidation potential of pollutants, electron transfer transpires between PMS* and pollutants adsorbed on the conjugated carbon skeleton, enabling spontaneous pollutant oxidation in a selective and non-radical manner.\nPractical application investigation\nThe large productive yield and remarkable catalytic performance of Co\n\nCNCl/S inspire us to investigate its practical implementation. Consequently, we assessed the degradation efficiency of ECs with a high concentration to verify the effectiveness of Co\n\nCNCl/S in more scenarios \nand Supplementary \n). Five typical pharmaceutical contaminants and six phenolic compounds were completely decomposed within 9 min with minimal PMS consumption. This indicated the excellent activity and broad applicability of Co\n\nCNCl/S in purifying low-potential contaminants via the ETP regime (Supplementary \n). Pollutants with higher redox potentials showed reduced oxidation (Supplementary \n), indicating that the selectivity of ETP supported the development of targeted wastewater treatment strategies. In addition, one molar phenol molecule consumed about 1.75 mol PMS molecules (Supplementary \n), demonstrating the high PMS utilization efficiency in this Co\n\nCNCl/S/ETP system. The catalyst at an initial pH of 3–11 also exhibited high degradation efficiency (Supplementary \n), illustrating the broad pH compatibility for Co\n\nCNCl/S-catalysed Fenton-like reaction. More importantly, the high removal efficiency of phenol was achieved in various real water sources (tap water, river water, deionized water and sea water) and in the presence of anion and cation interference owing to the high selectivity of ETP and high intrinsic activity of Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\nand Supplementary \nand\n\n). Approximately 85% total organic carbon removal was achieved (Supplementary \n). The ecological toxicity of potential intermediates was assessed using the Ecological Structure Activity Relationships (ECOSAR) software (Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nand Supplementary \n), revealing that most by-products exhibited relatively low acute and chronic toxicity to fish, daphnia and green algae. This indicated minimal environmental risk and highlighted the potential of the system for practical water treatment. Furthermore, Co\n\nCNCl/S also exhibited good reusability, as suggested by the continuous removal of phenol within 5 min over four cycles (Supplementary \n). Postreaction analysis of Co\n\nCNCl/S confirmed its morphological and structural robustness (Supplementary \n). The catalyst also demonstrated consistent performance across multiple synthesis batches (Supplementary \n), underscoring its reproducibility and robustness. Interestingly, this well-defined bicoordinated Co\n\nCNCl/S catalyst exhibited superior activity in oxygen reduction reactions compared with single-coordinated catalysts (Supplementary \n), thereby opening possibilities for extending its application to other electrocatalytic redox systems.\n\nCNCl/S system.

Cotton fibre was used as the support for Co\n\nCNCl/S to maintain the dispersion of the catalysts (Supplementary \n), where its effect on pollutant removal was excluded \n). Impressively, at a flow rate of 60 ml h\n−1\n, the reactor demonstrated superior efficiency (100%) in purifying 9.48 l of phenol-contaminated water with just 50 mg of Co\n\nCNCl/S loaded, achieving a purification rate of 189.6 l per gram of catalyst. This efficiency can be maintained for as long as 158 h, while the catalyst maintained its morphology well and remained fixed on the support after the process (Supplementary \n). Given these results, a tonne of phenol can be treated at the expense of $USD0.22 (Supplementary \n), which is lower than the reported PMS-AOPs\n\n. This outstanding performance originated from the good dispersion of the highly reactive Co\n\nCNCl/S catalyst on the cotton and its intrinsic well-defined coordination, which prevented the catalyst loss. This high-yield catalyst, which can achieve precise coordination regulation through simple methods, holds promise for large-scale production in practical applications for industrial wastewater treatment and can be applied to various fluidized bed systems.\nConclusions\nIn summary, the salt templating-confined growth preparation of SACs is promising for the mass production of atomic metal catalysts with deliberate microenvironment engineering. We have achieved a 36.5% yield of SAC catalysts in a well-defined Co–N\n\ncentre with spontaneous axial Cl bonding and second-shell S doping. Both DFT calculations and experimental investigations indicated that the short-range (axial Cl) and medium-range (second-shell S) modification effectively regulate the electronic structures of CoN\n\n, realizing an ultrahigh TOF of 1.82 min\n−1\nfor pollutant oxidation. The in-plane S and spatial Cl doping collectively afford an upward non-bonding state near the Fermi level with a lower\n\nd\n-band, which are favourable for PMS activation into a surface complex with high potential via a strengthened Co–O bond and facilitate the electron transfer capacity of SACs to trigger the non-radical ETP regime. Further integration of Co\n\nCNCl/S into column separation technology achieved high efficiency in treating pollutants, highlighting the exceptional ability of Cl\n\n–Co–N\n\n–S\n\nto deliver outstanding performance in continuous operations. The precise material synthesis at the molecular level and mechanistic insights of structure–activity relations of this work will not only enlighten the intelligent design of reaction-oriented single-atom materials for high intrinsic activity in green catalysis but also unlock their potential for practical applications in environmental remediation.\n\nPreparation of Co\nCNCl/S and other Co-based SACs\nNaCl (3 g), glucose (300 mg), CoSO\n\n·7H\n\nO (28.1 mg) and dicyandiamide (332 mg) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water and stirred continuously for 2 h. The resulting solution was freeze dried under vacuum to yield a powder, which was then ground in a mortar and pyrolysed at 900 °C for 2 h under an argon atmosphere, with a heating rate of 5 °C min\n−1\n.

While these values are ideal values, experimentally observed CCC values may deviate from these depending on the detailed transport conditions in the catalyst layer and membrane. Noninteger CCC values indicate nonstoichiometric (bi)carbonate formation inside the catalyst layer coupled with mixed anion transport. This means that only a portion of the generated alkalinity (OH\n−\n) is converted into carbonate (CCC somewhat below 1). If carbonate is not transported away fast enough, it may undergo subsequent reaction with another CO\n\nmolecule to form bicarbonate (CCC somewhat above 1). Such nonstoichiometric (bi)carbonate formation typically originates from transport barriers into or across the catalyst layer. Several kinetic electrolyzer performance parameters in Extended Data \ncan be expressed in terms of the CCC.\nThe CCC value of NiNC-IMI electrolyzer cells at low loadings remained close to 1 \n) suggesting prevalent\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\ncrossover. At higher NiNC-IMI catalyst loadings, the drop of the CCC value implies a gradual switch to OH\n−\ntransfer, which we attribute to CO\n\ntransfer limitations to the active sites. Indeed, as revealed by Galvano-electrochemical impedance spectra (GEIS) analysis, increased charge resistance (in low frequency region) emerges with high NiNC-IMI loadings (Supplementary \n). By contrast, the NiNC-PANI loading showed minor impact on the CCC. The prevalent anion transport mechanism remained\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\n\nexperimental data points, the two points in the upper left at 50 and 300 mA cm\n−2\nare interpreted as outliers, and all other data points associated with this measurement series are in the expected green (III) area.\n\nexperimental CCC value provides a FE-independent, heuristic ‘early-warning’ indicator of the onset of undesired electrolyzer operating regimes due to unfavorable mass (CO\n\nexperimentally.\nDuring cell stability tests, our cell design has currently demonstrated 180 h stability at 100 mA cm\n−2\nwith over 90% selectivity toward CO (Extended Data \n) without the use of highly soluble Cs salts\n\n. Over the course of the stability tests, time-resolved galvanostatic impedance spectroscopy (Extended Data \n) revealed only unspecific increases in charge transfer resistance over time. By contrast, with its heuristic character, the CCC value provides real-time qualitative diagnosis of potentially detrimental GDE operating regimes. Over time, the CCC trajectory showed periodic variations that we attribute to dynamic cell operation regimes with alternating salting/desalting events up to 110 h test time, followed by steady CCC values near 1.5 at stable cell operation (Extended Data \n). Similar periodic fluctuations at smaller cells were correlated to salt precipitation and flooding\n\n; as we work on another cell level, larger electrodes, we may not see a direct response in the FE or potential. Deviations from the ideal CCC value of 1 in either direction indicate detrimental dynamic operating states of the AEM CO\n\nelectrolyzer. The increase in CCC, as observed in Extended Data \n, is probably associated with local flooding events inside the GDE. The flooded regions dissolve more CO\n\nand lead to a local acidification (CCC increase from 1 toward 2 as HCO\n\n−\nbecomes the more dominant migrating ion) due to detrimental ion transport in the flooded region. On the other hand, a blocked GDE region, caused for instance by salting, hinders CO\n\ndiffusional transport into the GDE as well as its transport in TP and IP directions, which would lead to lower FE\n\nexperimental guidance as to the design of optimal CO\n\n-to-CO electrolyzers at three different levels: guidance for the design of catalyst materials, guidance for the design of optimal cathode catalyst layers and guidance for the design/choice of optimal operational cell parameters, such as the stoichiometric CO2 ratio,\nλ\n\nexperimentally considered several additional kinetic cell performance indicators, such as SP, stoichiometric CO\n\nexcess,\nλ\n\nexperimentally accessible CCC as the ratio between noncatalytic CO\n\nconsumption and generated alkalinity.

Both NiNC-IMI and NiNC-PANI samples exhibit a pronounced diffraction peak at around 26°, assigned to the family of graphitic carbon planes. Additional Bragg peaks suggested the presence of a metallic Ni\n\nphase, associated with (carbon-encapsulated) Ni nanoparticles in the bulk of the catalyst. It is well documented that such Ni particles are chemically inert for CO\n\nreduction electrocatalysis\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. The chemical state and elemental composition of the catalyst surface were obtained from X-ray photoemission spectra (XPS) (the survey is shown in \n), especially the core level regions of C1\ns\n, N1\ns\nand Ni2\np\n3/2 \n). Carbon speciation is dominated by\nsp\n\nhybridized moieties, showing a high carbonization degree. Following earlier analyses of metal–nitrogen-doped carbon electrocatalysts, the N speciation was split into a few distinct fractions (Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary \n). The Ni2\np\n3/2 core level region \n) revealed the Ni chemical state near the surface up to a depth of ~2–5 nm. Three different Ni chemical states (metallic Ni in embedded particles and Ni\n1+\n, Ni\n2+\nin NiN\nx\nsite motifs) were identified (Supplementary \n)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. In both NiNC-IMI and NiNC-PANI, Ni prevails in the chemical states of Ni\n2+\nand Ni\n1+\n. These two chemical Ni states are commonly found for the N-coordinated, catalytically active single Ni atom sites\n\n,\n\n. The overall elemental composition of either catalyst is very similar, with metallic Ni particles adding extra Ni at% for NiNC-IMI (Supplementary \n). The TEM micrographs in Supplementary \nrevealed the catalyst microstructures. Notably, NiNC-IMI exhibits a fiber-like backbone structure with homogeneously distributed diameters (~20 nm). In addition, carbon layer-embedded metallic Ni particles and pores (due to particle leaching) with constant size (5~10 nm) could be observed (Supplementary –c\n). By contrast, the NiNC-PANI shows a densely compacted layer-like backbone structure, and the encapsulated Ni particles vary from 10 to 50 nm in diameter (Supplementary –f\n). However, no visible pores could be identified. These results are corroborated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. The NiNC-IMI showed a specific surface area of 220 m\n\ng\n−1\nwith a large fraction of mesopores (~4–5 nm pore size). By contrast, NiNC-PANI provides a much higher surface area of 414 m\n\ng\n−1\ndue to the dominant microporosity (Supplementary \n). These distinct powder characteristics will, as shown below, translate into characteristic differences in their cathode layers and consequently in the respective electrolyzer cell performances, reflected in their carbon crossover diagnosis introduced below. By combining the BET surface area and the XPS near-surface fraction of Ni\n1+/2+\nspecies related to NiN\nx\nmotifs, we estimated\n\nand compared the NiN\nx\nsurface site density (SD) with other NiNC catalysts (Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary \n). NiNC-PANI and NiNC-IMI catalysts showed the highest exposed SD of all considered benchmark catalysts.\nTo explore the near-surface SD-normalized, intrinsic catalytic CO\n\nreduction kinetics of the single Ni atom catalysts and contrast their respective site accessibility, partial CO current densities and CO turnover frequencies were derived for different catalyst loadings. This was carried out in a conventional liquid electrolyte H-type cell and compared with a number of benchmark NiNC catalysts (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). Our two NiNC electrocatalysts in focus showed a peak 85–90% FE\nCO\nat approximately −0.75 V\nRHE\n, where RHE is reversible hydrogen electrode (Supplementary \n). The NiNC-IMI displayed the highest CO mass activity (exceeding 25 mA mg\n−1\n) due to its high active SD related to its mesoporous structure (Supplementary \n), closely followed by NiNC-PANI. Normalization of the mass (or equally geometric area) activity data using the NiN\nx\nsurface SD yielded almost identical intrinsic turnover frequency (TOF) versus cell potential (\nE\ncell\n) relations\n\n. This suggests the presence of similar active NiN\nx\nmotifs in the various NiNC catalysts (Supplementary \n), which is surprising given the vastly different chemical nature of the synthetic pathways. Yet this underscores the insensitivity of the emerging active site during pyrolysis to the chemical nature of the precursors. Supplementary \nalso reveals vastly different TOF–\nE\ncell\ntrajectories for\nE\ncell\n< −0.75 V. This difference is not due to varying site densities, but rather varying site accessibility. Mesoporous catalysts (NiNC-IMI) offer enhanced site accessibility and suffer from local CO\n\ndepletion resulting in plateauing TOF–\nE\ncell\nrelations. For a more in-depth analysis of the NiNC catalysts, different geometric loadings were tested ,e\n, Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\n). The results in \nshow that both catalysts are influenced by the loading, but it seems that the lower loadings of NiNC-IMI outperform the NiNC-PANI especially in terms of CO mass activity (Supplementary Figs.\n6d\nand\n7d\n). Besides slightly higher activity, they show similar trends that the activity decreases with increasing loading. This can be explained by mass transport and porosity, adding more catalyst will increase the catalyst layer thickness and density, which hamper the CO\n\ndiffusion especially in the smaller pores of NiNC-PANI. In addition, for further comparison, Supplementary ,b\nrepresents the results of Supplementary Figs.\n\nand\n\nas Tafel plots.\nNext, we moved to cast our NiNC-IMI and NINC-PANI catalysts into cathode layers of single-cell electrolyzers using spray coating of aqueous inks. To achieve comparable morphological cathode layer qualities, dynamic light scattering helped optimize the average agglomerated particle size and ink suspension stability (Supplementary Note\n\n).\nA TEM/scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the catalyst layer morphologies of NiNC-IMI and NiNC-PANI revealed important differences ,g\n). Larger-scale morphological differences of the two sprayed GDE layers became more obvious at higher-resolution SEM scales ,i\n) and cross-section SEM images ,k\n). Sponge-like channel structures with fine, dense and homogeneously distributed pores and channels (around 3 µm diameter) were revealed in the NiNC-IMI layer. By contrast, the NiNC-PANI catalyst layer showed larger but fewer channels (additional high-resolution SEM images are shown in Supplementary \n). Moreover, other physical characterizations, such as catalyst layer thickness, hydrophobicity, TP and IP conductivity and gas permeability were conducted on the sprayed GDEs, and the corresponding data are listed in Supplementary \n. All these parameters were measured with an uncompressed GDE and they both are comparable, only the NiNC-IMI is slightly thicker. However, these parameters cannot be correlated to the performance because we used a zero-gap cell, which means that the GDE is compressed to the thickness of the spacer/gasket (200 µm) and the parameters can change.\nCO\n\n-to-CO AEM electrolyzer design\nSpray-coated GDEs were tested in a single-pass zero-gap AEM flow electrolyzer cell incorporated in a customized test setup. The configuration of our electrolyzer (Supplementary \n), testing platform (Supplementary \n), mounting process (Supplementary \n) and a schematic zoom in of the cell (Supplementary –e\n) are illustrated. Volumetric electrolyzer outlet flow rates were tracked using a N\n\nbleed (Supplementary \nand Supplementary Equation\n\n) and used for subsequent reaction rate and carbon crossover diagnosis. NiNC-IMI and NiNC-PANI catalysts were tested at various geometric catalyst loadings. Before CO\n\nelectrolysis, the electrochemical cell impedance (Supplementary ,b\n) revealed values of 0.21 (±0.01) Ohm, independent of the catalyst loading. The catalytic CO\n\n-to-CO cell performance was screened from −50 mA cm\n−2\nto −500 mA cm\n−2\n(at 50 and 100 mA cm\n−2\nincrements). At the beginning of each break-in, a characteristic cathode potential overshoot up to −5.5 V appeared (Supplementary ,d\n). This potential overshoot increased with catalyst loading; we associate this with the ionic reinforcing and hydration process of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and the bipolar junction between ionomer and membrane.\nKey kinetic performance indicators (FE\nCO\nand partial CO current density,\nj\ngeo,CO\n) of the NiNC-based CO\n\n-to-CO electrolyzers are shown in –d\n(NiNC-IMI in blue and NiNC-PANI in red). For NiNC-IMI, FE\nCO\ncorrelated inversely with the geometric catalyst loading, which will be investigated with our mass transfer analysis later.

We measured double-layer currents at different scan rates (Supplementary ,b\n) and found that the interfacial capacitance does correlate with the NiNC-IMI loading yet does not for NiNC-PANI (Supplementary \n), further evidence for limited microporous site accessibility.\nTo better appreciate the overall performance of our CO\n\n-to-CO cell design, we contrast the set of kinetic NiNC-IMI GDE parameters to those of the reference NiNC-PANI GDE \n), the best previously published NiNC GDEs \n) and to state-of-the-art Ag-based catalyst GDEs \n) (details in Supplementary \n). The comparison attests to the present electrolyzer cell design as a favorable combination of performance indicators.\nThe diagnostic CCC\nHere, we propose the concept of a CCC as an experimental diagnostic tool for CO\n\nelectrolyzers. The CCC and its relation to FE\nCO\nvalues reveals the nature of the dominant anion transport across the membrane and point to origins of mass transfer limitations within and across the cathode. Thereby, the CCC diagnosis helps improve GDE designs.\nFirst, we recall that although the NiNC-IMI and NiNC-PANI catalysts delivered comparable apparent catalytic activities in the liquid electrolyte H-cell setup, their MEA current density–FE\nCO\nrelations at varying catalyst loadings differed sharply. We attribute this to distinctly different final catalyst layer morphologies ,k\n). As a result of this, distinct CO\n\ntransfer kinetics IP and across the catalyst layers ensued. Paired with the noncatalytic, acid–base CO\n\nconsumption by catalytically generated OH\n−\ninto HCO\n\n−\nand CO\n\n2−\nspecies inside the cathode \n), complex carbon mass transfer and consumption patterns arise ,c\n).\n\n, A schematic drawing of GDE structure and proposed reaction and mass transfer pathways in relation to the CCC.

First, there is the IP carbon mass transfer to the active sites along the active MEA area that triggers the catalytic CO\n\nconversion and the noncatalytic acid–base CO\n\nconsumption. Second, there is the TP carbon transfer (via\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\nor\n\\({\\rm{HC}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{-}\\)\n; \n). The TP carbon transfer leads to a current- and efficiency-dependent gas volume (flow rate) depletion in the cell outlet\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. On this basis, we can formulate three limiting reaction transport scenarios associated with mathematical correlations between the applied cell current,\nI\ncell\n, the FE\nCO\nand FE\nH2\nvalues and the electrolyzer exit flow rate (\n\\({\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{out}}\\)\n) (Supplementary \n):\n1.\nFor pure OH\n−\nlayer and membrane crossover, neither acid–base nor TP CO\n\ndepletion occurs. Electrochemical CO\n\n-to-CO conversion maintains the volume and carbon balance in the cathodic chamber, while the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) causes a current-controlled flow rate surplus (Supplementary \n).\n2.\nIn case of pure\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\ncrossover, every catalytically generated CO or H\n\nmolecule consumes one molecule of CO\n\nfor TP transfer. Now, the catalytic CO\n\n-to-CO conversion causes a current-dependent CO\n\nand exit flow rate depletion due to the cogenerated alkalinity, with the HER helping to balance the gas volume (Supplementary \n).\n3.\nIn case of pure\n\\({\\rm{HC}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{-}\\)\ntransfer, every catalytically generated CO or H\n\nmolecule consumes two molecules of CO\n\nfor TP transfer, causing the highest CO\n\nand exit gas volume depletion (Supplementary \n).\nWe now compare the three predicted limiting exit flow rate and current relations with the experimental data ,c\n). The dashed lines denote the limiting cases for perfect FEs according to Supplementary \n. The symbols are the experimental values. At low loadings (1.0 mg cm\n−2\nand ~95% FE\nCO\n) NiNC-IMI displayed an almost ideal flow depletion pattern over a wide current range, matching well the predicted\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\nTP transfer at FE\nCO\nof 100%, \n. By contrast, cells with higher catalyst loadings showed gradual volume surplus attributed to a rising FE\nH2\nand OH\n−\ncrossover. Conversely, the impact of the NINC-PANI loading was minor, not following a limiting mass transfer case, and showed an increasing crossover of OH\n−\nover\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\n, \n.\nTo deconvolute the nature of the CO\n\nconsumption further, we now explicitly take the catalytic production rates of CO (\n\\({\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{CO}}\\)\n) and H\n\n(\n\\({\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}}\\)\n) as well as the CO\n\ninput feed (\n\\({\\dot{V}}_\\mathrm{C{O}_{2},{in}}\\)\n) and the exit flow rate (\n\\({\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{out}}\\)\n) into account. Starting from the gas volume and carbon balance (Supplementary Note\n\nand Supplementary Equations\n\n–\n\n), we derive and define the experimentally accessible CCC for the acid–base CO\n\ndepletion as\n$${\\rm{CCC}}=\\frac{{\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}}+{\\dot{V}}_\\mathrm{C{O}_{2},{in}}-{\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{out}}}{{\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{CO}}+{\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}}}.$$\n\nThe CCC value can be perceived as the ratio between the noncatalytic acid–base CO\n\nconsumption rate and the rate of catalytic alkalinity production. It is experimentally accessible, independent of the faradaic value and reveals the nature of the prevalent anion crossing the membrane in an intuitive way: an experimental CCC value of 0 indicates pure OH\n−\ntransfer, a CCC value of 1 indicates transport of pure\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\nand a CCC value of 2 suggests pure\n\\(\\mathrm{H}{\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{-}\\)\ncrossover. While these values are ideal values, experimentally observed CCC values may deviate from these depending on the detailed transport conditions in the catalyst layer and membrane. Noninteger CCC values indicate nonstoichiometric (bi)carbonate formation inside the catalyst layer coupled with mixed anion transport. This means that only a portion of the generated alkalinity (OH\n−\n) is converted into carbonate (CCC somewhat below 1). If carbonate is not transported away fast enough, it may undergo subsequent reaction with another CO\n\nmolecule to form bicarbonate (CCC somewhat above 1). Such nonstoichiometric (bi)carbonate formation typically originates from transport barriers into or across the catalyst layer. Several kinetic electrolyzer performance parameters in Extended Data \ncan be expressed in terms of the CCC.\nThe CCC value of NiNC-IMI electrolyzer cells at low loadings remained close to 1 \n) suggesting prevalent\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\ncrossover. At higher NiNC-IMI catalyst loadings, the drop of the CCC value implies a gradual switch to OH\n−\ntransfer, which we attribute to CO\n\ntransfer limitations to the active sites. Indeed, as revealed by Galvano-electrochemical impedance spectra (GEIS) analysis, increased charge resistance (in low frequency region) emerges with high NiNC-IMI loadings (Supplementary \n). By contrast, the NiNC-PANI loading showed minor impact on the CCC. The prevalent anion transport mechanism remained\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\ncrossover at all currents \n).\nNext, we relate the stoichiometric CO\n\nratio,\nλ\nstoich\n(Extended Data \n), to the FE and applied currents \n,g\n) and express it in terms of the CCC to obtain\n$${{{\\lambda }}}_{{\\rm{stoich}}}=\\frac{{\\dot{V}}_\\mathrm{C{O}_{2},{in}}}{\\mathrm{CCC}({\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{CO}}+{\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}})+{\\dot{V}}_{\\mathrm{CO}}}.$$\n\nFor 1 mg cm\n−2\nNiNC-IMI, the experimentally determined values of\nλ\nstoich\nfollowed the theoretical CCC of 1 line (green dashed) up to ca. 1.5 A, associated with pure\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\ntransfer. With pure\n\\({\\rm{C}}{{\\rm{O}}}_{3}^{2-}\\)\ntransfer, the maximum CO\n\nSP is limited to 50%, as two molecules CO\n\nare consumed for each produced CO. Under these conditions, the NiNC-IMI cell (1 mg cm\n−2\n) SP reaches the very high SP of 40% at −300 mA cm\n−2\n, at a previously unachieved low\nλ\nstoich\n= 1.2 \n). As a result, our NiNC-IMI electrolyzer design delivers a concentrated CO exit stream. Increasing the flow rate would increase the selectivity but decrease the SP and result in a larger\nλ\nstoich\n(\n).\nUsing the\nλ\nstoich\nversus\nI\nplot, we can deepen the kinetic analysis further: the experimental values of\nλ\nstoich\nof the NiNC-PANI AEM electrolyzer cells at varying loadings dropped more slowly and remained above the ideal green dashed curve of an AEM electrolyzer. This was due to their low FE\nCO\n«100%, associated with CO\n\nbeing largely consumed for (bi)carbonate formation \n). At higher catalyst loadings, the NiNC-IMI AEM electrolyzer cells displayed larger than ideal initial\nλ\nstoich\nvalues, in particular CCC of 0 at FE\nCO\nof 100% \n, blue dashed line), implying OH\n−\nas the prevalent anion due to transport barriers for CO\n\nto enter the thick catalyst layers and to form stoichiometric amounts of carbonate inside the catalyst layer.\nTo demonstrate the practical, heuristic diagnostic value of the CCC and\nλ\nstoich\n-based electrolyzer cell performance analysis, we consider the cell data in FE\nCO\nversus CCC plots \n). We qualitatively distinguish distinct regions (green (III), yellow (II) and red (I)) that we associate with distinct IP and TP transport as well as distinct catalytic CO\n\nconversion.\n\n, FE\nCO\nversus CCC plots yield distinct operating reaction transport regimes (red (I), yellow (II) and green (III)) to diagnose the mass transfer limitations.\nb\n–\nd\n, Graphic illustration of controlling transport limitations in these three regions includes red (I): limited TP mass transport (higher loadings of NiNC-IMI, thicker layer) (\nb\n), yellow (II): good TP but inhibited IP mass transfer (NiNC-PANI) (\nc\n) and green (III): optimal mass transport region (lower loadings NiNC-IMI, thinner layer) showing optimal FEs (\nd\n). All points are single experimental data points, the two points in the upper left at 50 and 300 mA cm\n−2\nare interpreted as outliers, and all other data points associated with this measurement series are in the expected green (III) area.\nSource data\nFull size image\nOperating electrolyzer conditions at CCC ~1 and low FE\nCO\n<60% (yellow region (II) in ,c\n) suggest poor IP CO\n\ntransfer to active sites and poor subsequent catalytic conversion, as seen for the NiNC-PANI electrolyzers: suboptimal microporous morphology caused poor site accessibility and flooded micropores result in low FE\nCO\n, as confirmed by the microscopic analysis of the sprayed layer structure and the loading-independent double-layer capacitance (Supplementary \n). The loading-independent value of CCC ~1 is testament to sufficiently effective ionic TP channels in the catalyst layer. This regime calls for adjustment of the catalyst pore size at constant layer thickness.\nBy contrast, operating electrolyzer conditions with CCC «1 and low FE\nCO\n, as seen for NiNC-IMI cells at high loadings (red region (I) in ,b\n), are characterized by poor IP and poor TP transport. Insufficient TP ion channels exist, which explains why ion transport is shifted toward OH\n−\n. Higher loadings should increase the thickness, but we used for all tests the same spacer/gasket, which means the compression of thicker GDEs is higher. This regime calls for adjustment of the spacer/gasket/catalyst loading (reducing the compression) or even bigger pores to create pathways for CO\n\naccess and ion conductivity.\nOperating electrolyzer conditions with CCC ~1 and high FE\nCO\n, as seen for NiNC-IMI cells at 1 mg cm\n−2\n(green (III) region in ,d\n), attest to good site accessibility, layer thickness and good IP and TP transport. In our configuration, we have a positive tradeoff between layer thickness (loading), porosity and compression (spacer/gasket).\nOur analysis revealed that values decreased with increased NiNC-IMI loadings, while they remained constant for NiNC-PANI loadings. We speculate that NiNC layers do not compress in the same way as NiNC-PANI layers do. NiNC-PANI layers appear to remain accessible for CO\n\n, whereas thicker NiNC-IMI layers change their pores structure in a way that hinders CO\n\naccess.\nTracking the experimental CCC value provides a FE-independent, heuristic ‘early-warning’ indicator of the onset of undesired electrolyzer operating regimes due to unfavorable mass (CO\n\nand H\n\nO) and charge (ions) transport processes. If coupled to ex situ materials characteristics and operating parameters such as temperature and electrode pressures, the online CCC value helps pinpoint mechanistic origins of unfavorable operating regimes. Conversely, this helps optimize catalysts/catalyst layer/GDEs.\nLike catalytic materials and their noncatalytic precursor states, electrodes of the zero-gap electrolyzer show a complex relation among catalyst loading, layer thickness, porosity, compression and the resulting transport properties under operating conditions, which cannot be fully predicted from ex situ characterizations, as presented in Supplementary \n.\nOn the other hand, for electrolyzers operating under acidic conditions using Nafion membranes, a CCC of 0 will ensue as no anionic carbon species forms and crosses the cation exchange membrane. A CCC value of 2, which would suggest a pure HCO\n\n−\ntransfer, is yet to be observed experimentally.\nDuring cell stability tests, our cell design has currently demonstrated 180 h stability at 100 mA cm\n−2\nwith over 90% selectivity toward CO (Extended Data \n) without the use of highly soluble Cs salts\n\n. Over the course of the stability tests, time-resolved galvanostatic impedance spectroscopy (Extended Data \n) revealed only unspecific increases in charge transfer resistance over time. By contrast, with its heuristic character, the CCC value provides real-time qualitative diagnosis of potentially detrimental GDE operating regimes. Over time, the CCC trajectory showed periodic variations that we attribute to dynamic cell operation regimes with alternating salting/desalting events up to 110 h test time, followed by steady CCC values near 1.5 at stable cell operation (Extended Data \n). Similar periodic fluctuations at smaller cells were correlated to salt precipitation and flooding\n\n; as we work on another cell level, larger electrodes, we may not see a direct response in the FE or potential. Deviations from the ideal CCC value of 1 in either direction indicate detrimental dynamic operating states of the AEM CO\n\nelectrolyzer. The increase in CCC, as observed in Extended Data \n, is probably associated with local flooding events inside the GDE. The flooded regions dissolve more CO\n\nand lead to a local acidification (CCC increase from 1 toward 2 as HCO\n\n−\nbecomes the more dominant migrating ion) due to detrimental ion transport in the flooded region. On the other hand, a blocked GDE region, caused for instance by salting, hinders CO\n\ndiffusional transport into the GDE as well as its transport in TP and IP directions, which would lead to lower FE\nCO\nand lower experimental CCC values.\nThis contribution provides experimental guidance as to the design of optimal CO\n\n-to-CO electrolyzers at three different levels: guidance for the design of catalyst materials, guidance for the design of optimal cathode catalyst layers and guidance for the design/choice of optimal operational cell parameters, such as the stoichiometric CO2 ratio,\nλ\nstoich\n(Extended Data \n), to maximize the volumetric (or molar) exit CO ratio and the CO (catalytic) SP.\nAt the materials level , we propose mesoporous characteristics that offer favorable site accessibility when cast into a layer. At the layer level and cell operation level , the CCC serves as a guiding tool. The CCC is a diagnostic parameter to assess the quality of a prepared cathode layer concerning its transport properties \n). It also serves as a diagnostic tool to recognize and analyze the onset of degradation regimes and failure modes (Supplementary \n). We propose diagnostic cell performance analyses using experimental and theoretical (FE\nCO\n–CCC) plots and\nλ\nstoich\n–\nI\nplots. The former provide insight in limitations of TP (CCC) and IP (site accessibility) carbon transport. The latter provides the stoichiometric CO\n\nexcess, the stoichiometric limiting current, the CO ratio in the exit flow and critical current where the cell is leaving the cardinal trajectories of constant CCC.\nDiscussion\nWe have presented a highly CO-selective, layered imidazolate framework-derived NiNC electrocatalyst (NiNC-IMI) for the efficient electrochemical CO\n\nreduction to CO in zero-gap single-cell electrolyzers. This catalyst exhibited a favorable geometric and mass-based CO activity in liquid electrolyte H\n−\ncells due to its high catalytic active NiN\nx\nSD and good site accessibility compared with a polyaniline-derived NiNC-PANI reference catalyst. We associate these favorable properties with its unique mesoporous structure over the microporous characteristics of the NiNC-PANI.\nThe NiNC-IMI catalysts were cast into cathode layers of varying catalyst loadings, which were deployed into zero-gap AEM electrolyzer cells. Operated under neutral-pH anolyte conditions, the NiNC-IMI CO\n\n-to-CO electrolyzer design outperformed state-of-the-art Ag and previously reported NiNC cathodes. Under optimized catalyst loading and layer thickness, the experimental FE\nCO\nreached 100% up to a current density of −200 mA cm\n−2\n(\nE\ncell\n~ 3 V) and remained at 85% at −300 mA cm\n−2\n(\nE\ncell\n= 3.5 V). Beyond these popular performance metrics, we rigorously defined and experimentally considered several additional kinetic cell performance indicators, such as SP, stoichiometric CO\n\nexcess,\nλ\nstoich\n, and total EE.\nOur present CO\n\n-to-CO electrolyzer design concomitantly displayed close to 80% CO\n\nutilization, 40% SP to CO, 40% total EE and a uniquely low\nλ\nstoich\nvalue of 1.2 that translated into molar CO ratio of 70% in the exit flow. Such CO-rich mixed feeds offer superior C\n2+\nproduction rates when coupled to a second CO\n\nconversion electrolyzer tandem cell\n\n.\nBeyond the cell design, we proposed and validated diagnostic tools for CO\n\nelectrolyzers to deconvolute catalytic and noncatalytic CO\n\nconsumption. We defined an experimentally accessible CCC as the ratio between noncatalytic CO\n\nconsumption and generated alkalinity. The CCC values of 0, 1 and 2 were associated with the three physically limiting conditions of pure OH\n−\n, CO\n\n2−\nand HCO\n\n−\ntransport. We also showed how CCC–FE\nCO\nmaps define regions of distinct IP and TP transport regimes. Their diagnostic character reveals imperfections of CO\n\ncathode layers and thereby helps improve electrolyzer designs.\n\nSynthesis of NiNC-IMI precursor\nThe NiNC-IMI was synthesized following a prior literature approach\n\n. Briefly, 8.72 g Ni(NO\n\n)\n\n□6H\n\nO (0.03 mol) and 24.0 g imidazole were mixed and stirred in 600 ml deionized (DI) water. Then, 1,200 ml 0.3 M NaOH was dropped into the aforementioned mixture with a titration speed of 60 ml min\n−1\n. After 6 h of stirring, the mixture was vacuum filtered and washed until neutral pH. The residual yellow powder was freeze dried and named as NiNC-IMIdazolate precursor.\n\nSynthesis of imidazolate-derived NiNC\nThe NiNC-IMI precursor was placed in a tube furnace and annealed at 800 °C for 3 h (ramping: 5.0 °C min\n−1\n) under a N\n\natmosphere (~80 ml min\n−1\n). The carbonized powder was dispersed in 200 ml H\n\nSO\n\n(ca. 1 M) at 80 °C and stirred for 10 h. The acid washed sample was collected and washed with DI water until neutral pH and freeze dried to the as-prepared catalyst.\n\nSynthesis of the reference NiNC catalyst\nThe PANI-derived samples were prepared following our previous published approach. Briefly, 3 ml of aniline, 5 g NiCl\n\n□6H\n\nO and 5 g ammonium persulfate ((NH\n\n)\n\nS\n\nO\n\n) were mixed in 0.5 l of 1 M HCl and stirred for 1 h. The suspension was stirred for 48 h after adding 0.4 g of dispersed activated Ketjen 600 carbon. The liquid suspension was thereafter dried at 95 °C for 24 h, and the residual solid mixture was ball milled with Zr\n\nO\n\nballs for 20 min.\nThe pyrolysis was carried out in a furnace with a ramp of 30 °C min\n−1\nto 900 °C and kept at this temperature for 1 h in N\n\nconditions. An acid washing step in 2 M H\n\nSO\n\nat 90 °C for overnight was performed to remove the excessive Ni particles. In this synthesis, four heat treatments and three acid washes were performed in turn, and the catalyst is obtained after the fourth pyrolysis (pyrolysis/acid washing, pyrolysis/acid washing, pyrolysis/acid washing and pyrolysis).\nCatalyst characterization by BET, SEM, TEM and XPS\n\nN\n\nsorption measurements were carried out using a Quantachrome Quadrasorb SI instrument with a degassing temperature of 200 °C for 6 h (carbon samples) and 120 °C for 12 h (NiNC-IMI samples) before the measurement. The specific surface areas were calculated using BET theory. The pore size distributions were obtained from the adsorption branch of isotherms by the nonlocalized density functional theory model. SEM images were measured using a Gemini SEM 500 low-vacuum high-resolution SEM. Cross-sectional SEM images were obtained with SEM/field emission gun Inspect F 50-FEI. TEM was performed using a FEI Tecnai G\n\n20 S-TWIN electron microscope with an operating voltage of 200 kV. The conductivity was measured with Yokogawa GS610 Sourcemeter unit in galvanostatic mode between −2 mA and +2 mA in 0.2 mA steps. XPS was conducted on a K-alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer system (Thermo Scientific) with a hemispheric 180° dual-focus analyzer with a 128 channel detector. The X-ray monochromator was micro-focused Al Kα radiation. The samples were pasted and pressed onto the sample holder using carbon taps for measurement.\nGDE preparation\nFirst, 85 mg as-prepared catalyst, 300 mg Nafion solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 5 wt% Nafion in ethanol (EtOH) solution), 100 μl DI water and 2,900 μl isopropanol were mixed and sonicated using a sonifier horn for 15 min. The prepared ink was spray coated onto the commercial gas diffusion layer (GDL) provided by DeNora (GDL2) on the microporous layer at 80 °C."
