A grinded powder of ammonium paramolybdate was calcined in a muffle oven to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C min\n−1\nto synthesize the precursor MoO\n\nmixture (100 ml min\n−1\n; 20/80 v/v), and the temperature was increased to 700 °C at 5 °C min\n−1\nand held at 700 °C for 2 hours. Finally, the sample was passivated at room temperature using a 0.5% O\n\nmixture (100 ml min\n−1\n; 20/80 v/v), with the temperature being increased at 5 °C min\n−1\nto 300 °C, then at 1 °C min\n−1\nto 700 °C. After carburization at 700 °C for 2 hours, the sample was cooled to room temperature and passivated using a 0.5% O\n\nC support was transferred to a deaerated, aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of chloroplatinic acid (H\n\nO) to achieve the desired loading. The slurry was stirred for 3 hours, dried using evaporation, and then transferred to a freeze dryer overnight to remove any moisture. Before catalytic evaluation, the catalyst was activated with a CH\n\nmixture (15/85 v/v). The activation temperature program heated the sample to 300 °C and held it there for 1 hour. The temperature was then increased to 590 °C at a rate of 5 °C min\n−1\nand held there for another 2 hours.\n2%Pt/α-MoC and 2%Pt/MoC-2 catalysts\n. An appropriate amount of H\n\n, an appropriate amount of ammonium paramolybdate was dissolved into pure water, adjusting the pH of the solution to 3.7. The solution underwent ultrasonication for 2 hours. The precipitates thus generated were separated by evaporation of solvent and dried at 60 °C under a vacuum overnight. The precipitates were then grinded into powder and calcined in air at 500 °C for 4 hours.) After being dried at room temperature under vacuum, the sample was calcined at 500 °C for 4 hours. For Pt/α-MoC, the calcined Pt/MoO\n\nO aqueous solution was added into the ammonium paramolybdate solution dropwise under stirring. A yellow precipitant was thus generated. The solvent was evaporated at 90 °C and the precipitant was dried at 120 °C for 3 hours to ensure that the powder was dried\n\n. The slurry was stirred for 3 hours in air to remove the liquid, using the rotary evaporator under vacuum at 35 °C. The material was dried at 120 °C for 3 hours, and then calcined in the muffle oven at 500 °C. The Pt loading is 2%. The catalysts were reduced with H\n\nbefore catalytic evaluation.\nPt/α-MoC catalysts with different Pt loadings\n. Pt/α-MoC catalysts with 2.2 wt%, 3.1 wt%, 5.1 wt% and 7.4 wt% Pt loadings were prepared as for Pt/α-MoC. Samples with 0.2 wt% and 0.7 wt% Pt loading were prepared using the wetness impregnation method with activated α-MoC as the support. The catalysts are denoted\nx\n%Pt/α-MoC, where\nx\ndenotes the rough weight concentration of Pt (\nx\n= 0.2, 1, 2, 3, 5 or 7).\nEvaluation of catalytic performance\nBefore their performance was evaluated, all Pt/MoC catalysts were activated in a CH\n\n, for each cycle, the system was reacted at 190 °C for 1.25 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, the gases were analysed by gas chromatography and then released. Then the system was reheated to 190 °C and reacted for another 1.25-hour cycle. A total of 11 cycles was conducted, with the turnover number reaching 132,166. As regards the observed decline in turnover number per cycle, the possible reasons could be: first, some catalyst particles migrated to the upper part of the reactor during the reaction; or second, the CO\n\nat 590 °C for 2 hours. After activation, the sample was introduced directly into an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber for XPS measurement at room temperature without exposure to air. The XPS spectra were processed using CasaXPS software (\nhttp://www.casaxps.com/\n).\nTo investigate the surface chemical structure of catalyst after exposure to methanol and water, we activated the pellet of 2%Pt/α-MoC or 0.2%Pt/α-MoC in the pretreatment chamber of the XPS spectrometer at 590 °C under 60 ml min\n−1\nCH\n\nfor 60 min at 190 °C. After exposure, the catalyst pellet was transferred into the ultrahigh-vacuum chamber for measurement.\nElectron microscopy\nSTEM characterization was performed on an aberration-corrected Nion UltraSTEM-100, operated at 100 kV (\n). The Z-contrast images were collected with an annular dark field detector in the range of 86–200 mrad. The convergence angle was set to 30 mrad. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy was carried out with the same experimental set-up.\nCatalyst samples for STEM analysis were prepared by first embedding the catalyst powder in resin and then slicing it into electron-transparent TEM samples using a microtome. The TEM samples were baked at 160 °C under vacuum for 8 hours before loading them into the electron microscope. Control experiments were performed on samples prepared by dry dispersing of catalyst powder directly onto the TEM grid inside a glovebox under argon protection and without vacuum baking. The results are qualitatively the same.\nTemperature-programmed surface reactions\nMethanol desorption\n. We examined the desorption behaviour of methanol on the catalysts using the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) technique. Before analysis, we pretreated about 50 mg of the passivated Pt/MoC-based catalyst in 15% CH\n\n(\nm\n/\nz\n= 60) were recorded with an OMINI Star mass spectrometer.\nMethanol plus water surface reaction\n. The temperature-programmed surface reaction of methanol and water uses the same experimental procedure as that for methanol TPD, except for the adsorption stage: here, a mixture of methanol and water was introduced by 80 ml min\n−1\nhelium flow for 15 min at room temperature. (The amount of methanol and water in the mixture was calculated from the phase diagram for the methanol–water system, and the molarity of methanol aqueous solution was controlled such that\nP\nmethanol\n/\nP\nwater\nin the gas phase equalled 1.)\nComputational details"

The attainable spatial resolution of this microscope is 78 pm. XPS experiments were performed on a ULVAC PHI Quantera microprobe. Binding energies were calibrated by setting the measured binding energy of carbon 1\ns\nto 284.8 eV. The in situ environmental microscopic study was performed on a Titan ETEM microscope (FEI) operating at 300 kV. The sampling nanoparticles are diluted in ethanol and dispersed with ultrasonic waves. The solution was then cast onto a MEMS in situ heating chip, blow dried with dry air and mounted on a functional TEM holder (DENSsolutions, wildfire). Both the chip and the sample holder were plasma cleaned by 30 min to avoid cross-pollution. After casting, the chip and the holder were again cleaned by ultraviolet radiation for 5 min under 35 mbar vacuum to remove the residual organics. The gaseous environment was created inside the ETEM column with pure argon (99.9995%) and heated by the MEMS heater integrated with the chip.

For adsorbed species, ∆\nH\nat 0 K, 0 bar is a good approximation to ∆\nG\n, as the\nS\ncontributions are small. However, for gaseous or liquid molecules such as formic acid, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water, we must consider the large entropy term at elevated temperatures.\nData availability\nFull data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its\nSupplementary Information\n, as well as from the corresponding author on reasonable request."

Graphene quantum dots, later interweaved into a carbon matrix, were used as a support, providing numerous anchoring sites and thus facilitating the generation of high densities of transition-metal atoms with sufficient spacing between the metal atoms to avoid aggregation. A significant increase in activity in electrochemical CO\n\nsynthesis transition of the GQDs–NH\n\n/Ir\n3+\nmixture to the single-atom Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, we first examined the sample using ex-situ X-ray diffraction under different temperatures, which represent different synthesis phases. As shown in Supplementary \n, the GQDs started to get fused at 300 °C to form an amorphous bulk carbon, indicated by the emerging of a broad peak at around 19° as well as the decreasing of the intensity of the GQD peak. The amorphization transition might be due to the heavy incorporation of nitrogen and iridium atoms into the GQD lattice under high temperature. With the temperature further increased, the peak of the GQDs completely disappeared, and two broad peaks at approximately 19° and 38° (Supplementary \n) emerged, suggesting the full formation of amorphous bulk carbon from GQD assembly after pyrolysis. No metallic iridium peaks were observed in Ir–N–C-7 catalysts. Ex-situ XPS study (Supplementary \n) reveals that the oxidation state of Ir gradually increases from 300 °C to 500 °C, which also implies that the Ir\n3+\nstabilized by the amine functional group in the GQDs–NH\n\n/Ir\n3+\nmixture gradually coordinated with the lattice nitrogen and carbon to form more stable Ir–N\n\nsynthesis. However, we found that even if the loading of Ir is less than 10 wt%, nanoparticles will be formed (Supplementary \n), showing obvious metallic Ir X-ray diffraction peaks. This observation reveals that a high-loading Ir single-atom catalyst could not be obtained using the carbon support with only a high level of nitrogen dopant, demonstrating the unique role of the GQDs.

As shown in\n, the as-synthesized Ni–N–C-3 catalyst presents atomically dispersed nickel without observable nickel clusters. The colocation of nickel and nitrogen on the carbon support was also demonstrated by the STEM–EELS point spectrum \n). The highest nickel single-atom loading we can obtain is approximately 15 wt% (3.6 at.%; Supplementary \n) in Ni–N–C-3, which is at least twofold higher than previously reported Ni single-atom catalysts \n). As the nickel species can be readily dissolved in aqua regia solution, we then used inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry to double confirm the nickel atom loading. As a result, the inductively coupled plasma gives a nickel content of 15.4 ± 0.4 wt% for Ni–N–C-3, which is in good agreement with XPS and TGA estimations, confirming the high accuracy of the XPS and TGA methods for single-atom loading quantification.

Next, 1.2 grams of dried 1,3,6-trinitropyrene powder were dispersed into a solution containing 220 millilitres of DI water and 20 millilitres of concentrated ammonia solution (30%, Sigma). The above mixture was ultrasonicated in ice water using a batch sonicator for 4 h. Sixty millilitres of the homogeneous suspension were transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 millilitres). The four autoclaves (total 240 millilitres mixture solution) were heated at 200 °C for 10 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, all the product-containing solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm microporous membrane to remove insoluble carbon product and further concentrated to ~90 millilitres by rotation drying.

It is worth noting that in most carbon-based SA systems oxygen quickly evaporates at 800 °C or above\n\n. If we had built the library at high temperatures, we would have been less likely to reveal the positive correlation between SA loading and oxygen. It is also important to note that correlation does not mean causality. Our in situ investigation does indeed suggest that oxygen plays an important role in anchoring SAs on carbon at low temperatures and that nitrogen replaces oxygen only at higher temperatures, as oxygen evaporates more easily than nitrogen\n\n.\nConcentration-complex multimetallic SACs\nOn the basis of the synthesis of the 37 mono-element SACs, the library suggests that the dissolution-and-carbonization strategy enables the chelation of different metal centres on glucose and their separation by glucose backbones, and thus we infer that the strategy can facilitate the formation of concentration-complex multiple metallic-element SAs in one sample. Then, by controlling the species and concentrations of multiple metal precursors, multimetallic SAs, such as 2-, 8- and 12-metal SACs, are successfully achieved, with their atomic dispersions verified by aberration-corrected STEM imaging and XAFS measurement –f\nand Supplementary Figs.\n64–67\n). The 8- and 12-metal SACs with high metal loading are extremely difficult to synthesize because each metallic atom in the 8- and 12-metal SACs must overcome the aggregations with not only themselves but also any one of the other metallic atoms. However, we synthesized an eight-metal SAC containing V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn (Supplementary \n) and a 12-metal SAC with Sc, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Pd, Hf and W \nand Supplementary Figs.\n66–68\n).

The dried precursor mixture of ammonium molybdate or manganese nitrate, hydroxylamine hydrochloride and glucose for the synthesis of Mo SAC or Mn SAC was pressed on a Cu substrate, transferred to the XPS chamber and heated in ultrahigh vacuum. The XPS spectra were recorded at given temperatures.\nIn situ soft XAS data were collected with total electron yield signal on the TLS-BL24A beamline, NSRRC. During the measurement, the samples were mounted on the non-oxygen copper plate and heated at given temperatures under high-vacuum conditions.\n\npreparation\nThe preparation of the working electrode was carried out as follows: a 6 mg catalyst was first dispersed in 500 µl of ethanol. Then, 500 µl of Nafion solution (0.5%) was added to the suspension, followed by sonication for 1 h to form the homogeneous ink. 200 µl of the ink was dropped onto a 1 × 1 cm\n−2\ncarbon paper in four drops and dried at room temperature for electrochemical measurements.\n\nmethods\nIn this work, we have performed the theoretical XANES calculations to explore the local structure of each single-atom metallic element within the FDMNES package in the framework of a real-space full multiple-scattering scheme with the muffin-tin approximation\n\n,\n\n. The energy-dependent exchange–correlation potential was calculated in the real Hedin–Lundqvist scheme, and then the XANES spectra were convoluted using a Lorentzian function with an energy-dependent width to account for the broadening from both the core-hole and final-state widths. A cluster of 7.0 Å radius containing ~70 atoms was used in the calculation, with satisfactory convergence being achieved. The structural models for XANES fitting were built on the basis of the EXAFS fitting results and were further optimized by DFT. Quantitative XANES fittings were carried out on each single-atom metallic element to approach the real local structure by optimizing the agreement between calculation and experiment.

However, achieving single-atom dispersions at metal contents above 2 wt% remains challenging. Here we introduce a versatile approach combining impregnation and two-step annealing to synthesize ultra-high-density single-atom catalysts with metal contents up to 23 wt% for 15 metals on chemically distinct carriers. Translation to a standardized, automated protocol demonstrates the robustness of our method and provides a path to explore virtually unlimited libraries of mono- or multimetallic catalysts. At the molecular level, characterization of the synthesis mechanism through experiments and simulations shows that controlling the bonding of metal precursors with the carrier via stepwise ligand removal prevents their thermally induced aggregation into nanoparticles. The drastically enhanced reactivity with increasing metal content exemplifies the need to optimize the surface metal density for a given application. Moreover, the loading-dependent site-specific activity observed in three distinct catalytic systems reflects the well-known complexity in heterogeneous catalyst design, which now can be tackled with a library of single-atom catalysts with widely tunable metal loadings.

In the representative synthesis of the\n0.17Rh@MEL\n, a gel solution was prepared by dissolving 0.030 g of KOH (0.5 mmol) in 2.32 ml of deionized H\n\nMethods\n). Although some approximations were made and thus uncertainties were introduced, it was still helpful to understand the complexity of Rh speciation, and a set of representative structurally reasonable models were accordingly proposed (Supplementary \n).\n\nmethods proposed in refs.\n\n,\n\n. In general, the active sites both inside and outside the zeolite channels/voids would contribute to the catalytic conversion of substrates, as long as the diffusion diameter is lower than that of zeolite apertures. By contrast, the molecules that possess larger size than that of zeolite apertures could not access the active sites within the zeolite channels/voids, therefore the contribution to its conversion should be attributed to the metallic species outside the zeolite channels/voids. As such, the proportion of active sites inside the zeolite channels/voids could be estimated on the basis of the difference in the reaction rate between small and large molecules. In particular, we chose 1-octene (kinetic diameter = 5.3 Å) and cyclooctene (kinetic diameter = 8.0 Å) as probe reactants and taking hydrogenation of them as the model reaction to differentiate the relative content of Rh species located outside and inside the channel/voids of MEL zeolite (aperture dimensions 5.3 × 5.4 Å). In detail, the hydrogenation rates for 1-octene and cyclooctene on an unconstrained cluster dispersed on fumed silica (Rh/SiO\n\n, prepared by wet impregnation) were first measured and the ratio of TOF\n1-octene\n\nmethods. All of the calculated Gibbs free energies were corrected at the reaction temperature of 90 °C according to a literature method\n\n. It should be noted that, despite taking these adjustments into account, a large deviation from theoretically calculated results and corresponding experimental values has still emerged. Indeed, such a deviation has been broadly witnessed in Rh-catalysed hydroformylation of propene\n\n,\n\n. Inherent computational limitations and approximations usually contributed to the observations\n\n,\n\n. Nonetheless, both the applied theoretical model and the computational method in our calculations were maintained the same throughout the exploration of both reaction pathways. Hence, the above-mentioned deviation between experimental and theoretical results would not affect the overall conclusion. We thus reasoned that the evaluation of the kinetic differences between two reaction pathways by directly comparing their energy barriers under the same benchmark was reliable. Our DFT calculations were carried out only at 4 MPa, which was same as the pressure chosen for the experimental studies, and we reasoned that such an option was appropriate. Moreover, because the change of pressure did not have a large impact on the selectivity (Supplementary \n), we assumed that it might not be necessary to conduct exhaustive DFT calculations at all other different pressures at the expense of valuable computing resources.\nThe theoretical model of [Rh(CO)\n\n]@MEL was constructed by locating the Rh atom within a silanol nest inside the channels of MEL zeolite. In detail, the MEL model was first obtained by structural optimization of a crystalline unit cell of MEL zeolite derived from the Crystallography Open Database. Subsequently, a silanol nest was created by removing one skeletal Si atom from either inside or outside the MEL channel. A single Rh atom was then located in the silanol group and coordinated with two O atoms to generate an isolated Rh mode. The cluster model [Rh"

Each step in a catalyst synthesis method can play an important role in preparing the most efficient catalyst. Here we report the careful manipulation of the post-synthetic heat treatment procedure—together with control over the metal loading—to prepare a highly efficient 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO 2 catalyst for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene. For Pt/TiO 2 catalysts with 0.2 and 0.5 wt% loading levels, reduction at 450 °C induces the coverage of TiO x over Pt nanoparticles through a strong metal–support interaction, which is detrimental to their catalytic activities. However, this can be avoided by following calcination treatment with reduction (both at 450 °C), allowing us to prepare an exceptionally active catalyst. Detailed characterization has revealed that the peripheral sites at the Pt/TiO 2 interface are the most likely active sites for this hydrogenation reaction.

The reactor was sealed and linked with a conduit to combine with the water-splitting electrolytic cell. Then, the reactor was heated to 80 °C and stirring with a speed fixed at 450 r.p.m. to ensure the diffusion effect was eliminated. Mesitylene (1 mmol), used as the internal standard, was added at the beginning of the reaction with stirring at 80 °C in an oil bath. The product was identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TXQ Quantum XLS, column TG-WAXMS, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quantitatively analysed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-2010 Plus equipped with a flame ionization detector) and a 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm KB-WAX capillary column (Kromat Corporation) using mesitylene as an internal standard. The selectivity and yield were calculated using equations (\n\nTo generate the results of specific productivity shown in \n, for each cycle the system was reacted at 80 °C for 1 h. When the reaction time reached 1 h, 50 μl of the solution was extracted with a miniature syringe from the glass electrolytic cell and analysed by gas chromatography. Meanwhile, we reinjected the system quickly with new reactants (nitrobenzene (0.2 mmol) and styrene (0.2 mmol)) to let the system start the next cycle for another hour. A total of 13 cycles were conducted, and the yields of each cycle were recorded by gas chromatography. We could calculate the yields of each cycle test by the same method as above and the specific productivity was calculated using equation (\n\nCharacterization\nXRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku Miniflex-600 operated at 40 kV voltage and 15 mA current using a Cu Kα radiation (\nλ\n= 0.15406 nm).

The high-resolution TEM and HAADF-STEM images, and the corresponding electron energy-loss spectroscopy, were recorded on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin high-resolution transmission electron microscope worked at 200 kV and a JEOL JEM-ARM200F TEM/STEM with a spherical aberration corrector worked at 300 kV. Through-focal HAADF series were acquired at nanometre intervals, with the first image underfocused (beyond the beam exit surface) and the final image overfocused (before the beam entrance surface). The images were then manually aligned to remove the sample drift effects. Elemental analysis of Pd in the solid samples was detected by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (Optima 7300 DV).

However, large-scale conversion of CO 2 into selective products remains a challenge. Coupled thermal–electrochemical catalysis could offer an attractive approach to upgrading CO 2 into value-added products if selective electrocatalysts and integrated devices were developed. Here we identify a mechanistic route to selectively producing either CO or CH 4 with high selectivity (>95%) using Ir–ceria-based catalysts in an intermediate-temperature (400 °C) CO 2 electrolyser that operates at low overpotential and ambient pressure. We show that tuning of the Ir–O hybridization by controlling the Ir speciation can alter the catalyst surface chemical environment, enabling the stabilization of specific transition states for the production of either CO or CH 4 during electrocatalysis. By achieving CO 2 electrohydrogenation in tandem with light-alkane electrodehydrogenation, we further demonstrate that such an advanced electrolyser could be extended to the upgrade of different carbon resources in one-step, significantly enhancing the techno-economic feasibilty of the process.

CO FTIR was used to analyse the active sites on palladium \n). The CO adsorption on the parent Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst containing large palladium nanoparticles, the peak ratio of linear to multiply bonded CO (L/M) is only 0.06. The catalyst prepared by imprinting with a large template molecule (TPB-Print-Pd/SiO\n\n) catalyst still shows a high TOF for toluene (1.96 h\n−1\n), but extremely low TOFs for the hydrogenation of mesitylene (0.08 h\n−1\n) and TPB (0.03 h\n−1\n). This phenomenon can be explained by the presence of active islands over the palladium surface created by preadsorbed toluene. In this case, the active islands on the palladium surface with the shape and size of the toluene molecule can hinder the adsorption of larger molecules such as mesitylene and TPB. This explanation has been further supported by using mesitylene as a template.

Adsorbed DMAPA donates electron density to the surface Pd atoms and decreases the intrinsic activity. The electronic effect could result in an increase in the activation energy for the hydrogenation of molecules in the imprinted areas. Indeed, measuring toluene hydrogenation at different temperatures over the Pd/SiO\n\n(Supplementary \n). This effect can be explained by both the lower electronic effect and the higher proportion of continuous palladium sites on the sponge in comparison with highly dispersed supported palladium catalysts.\nSelective hydrogenation of benzene in the mixture\nOur results suggest that this molecular imprinting methodology can be efficiently used for selective catalytic reactions. Control of selectivity is achieved by creating an active island on the metallic surface via adsorption–desorption of the template molecules and poisoning. We demonstrate further that this concept opens perspectives for practical applications; for example, for selective removal of benzene from a mixture of aromatics. Benzene is a carcinogenic compound and its content has to be reduced to less than 1% in gasoline\n\n. However, hydrogenation of the mixture of aromatics not only hydrogenates benzene but also hydrogenates other molecules. Therefore, a smart catalyst that could selectively hydrogenate benzene in a complex mixture of aromatics would be highly desirable.\nThe imprinted Pd/SiO\n\n, 0.25–48 h. TOF measurements were performed three times in each case. The error bars represent the s.d. The relative s.d. is within 5%. Benzene can be selectively hydrogenated in a mixture with other aromatic molecules over catalysts prepared by imprinting benzene as a template.\nSource data\nFull size image\nSubsequently, we performed hydrogenation of benzene in a mixture with other aromatic molecules (benzene/toluene, benzene/\np\n-xylene and benzene/mesitylene). As shown in –d\n, the selectivity of benzene hydrogenation over Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalysts show similar intrinsic catalytic activity for pyridine hydrogenation (134 versus 139 h\n−1\n, Supplementary \n).\nThe concentration effect of benzene in the mixture with aromatics was further investigated. The weight ratio of benzene to other aromatics decreased from 1 to 0.5 and then to 0.1 (Supplementary \n). The imprinted Ben-Print-Pd/SiO\n\ncatalyst exhibited high selectivity for benzene hydrogenation even at the lowest benzene concentration (Supplementary ,d,f\n). These results demonstrate the potential application of these imprinted palladium catalysts for selective benzene removal from mixtures of different aromatics.\nConclusions\nWe have demonstrated a molecular imprinting strategy for enhancing the selectivity of chemical reactions catalysed by heterogeneous palladium metal catalysts. By using DMAPA as a poisoner and various aromatic molecules of different sizes, including toluene, mesitylene and TPB, as templates, we successfully prepared a series of imprinted palladium catalysts. The catalytic results demonstrate that these imprinted palladium catalysts have a size-dependent reactivity for the hydrogenation of aromatic molecules. Moreover, the imprinted palladium catalysts prepared with benzene as a template exhibited preferential hydrogenation of benzene in a mixture of aromatics. Our results prove the potential application of imprinted catalysts for selective removal of carcinogenic benzene from reformate gasoline. The molecular imprinting strategy that we describe not only provides a powerful way to design a selective catalytic surface but also offers an additional understanding of the phenomena occurring during adsorption and catalytic reactions on the metal surfaces.\n\nin aqueous solution.

Before chemisorption, the catalyst (40 mg) was treated with 5% H\n\n/Ar (30 ml min\n−1\n) at 550 °C for 0.5 h, followed by cooling to approximately −110 °C by liquid nitrogen with an helium purge (30 ml min\n−1\n). We then introduced a pulse of 10% CO/He into the reactor and quantified the CO passed through the catalyst bed using a thermal conductivity detector. This pulse measurement was repeated until no more CO was adsorbed. The dispersion was estimated assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry of CO adsorption on platinum and/or cobalt.\nLaser Raman spectroscopy experiments were carried out using a JEOL NRS-5100 spectrometer at room temperature to investigate the carbonaceous deposits over the spent catalysts, with 2 cm\n−1\nresolution of the apparatus and a 532 nm excitation source.\nXAFS spectra of the prepared catalysts were collected at the BL01B1 beamline of SPring-8, Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI) using Si (for Co K-edges and Pt L\nIII\n-edges) and Si (for In K-edge) double-crystals as monochromators.

The resulting dark-brown solid was purified via hot extraction with methanol for 48 h using a Soxhlet extractor, then dried under vacuum at 150 °C for 24 h. Protonation-assisted exfoliation of the as-prepared bulk polymer was performed according to the reported literature\n\n. To summarize, Aza-CMP (100 mg) was dispersed in 100 ml of 12 M HCl, and the suspension was subjected to ultrasonication for 24 h. The mixture was diluted with deionized water and centrifuged at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 min to separate large aggregates. Exfoliated nanosheets were collected by filter (polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 45 μm) and washed thoroughly with water.\n\nSynthesis of Aza-CMP-Co\nAza-CMP material was modified with Co\n2+\nusing cobalt(II) acetate. Aza-CMP (20 mg) was immersed in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF and the suspension stirred for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere, with the gas bubbling through the solution. Next, 85 mg (1.5 eq. with respect to phenanthroline units) of cobalt(II) acetate was dissolved in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF under Ar. The Co solution was slowly added to the suspension under Ar, and the mixture was maintained in a dispersed state by ultrasonication for 8 h at room temperature. The solid was filtered and then washed with DMF, water, methanol and ethanol until the filtrate became colourless. Finally, the product was dried at 80 °C under vacuum conditions. Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) was fabricated via the same procedure while replacing the as-prepared bulk Aza-CMP with exfoliated Aza-CMP.\n\nPreparation of catalyst inks and film on the electrode\nThe catalyst was dispersed in a water/ethanol 1:1 solution to form an ink, which was prepared by immersion of 5 mg of catalyst in a solution containing 0.25 ml each of water and ethanol. The catalyst ink was transferred to an ultrasonic bath and sonicated for 60 min, then 10 μl of the ink was deposited onto the CP electrode (5 × 5 mm\n\n). For drying of ink droplets, the electrode was kept under an Ar atmosphere until the film was completely dry.\n\nMethods\nfor details about OER post treatment). The almost coincident curves in –h\nsuggest minimal changes in the first-coordination shell around cobalt sites after OER. Moreover, WT analysis results of Aza-CMP-Co and Aza-CMP-Co (posted) exhibit similar intensity maxima at 3.90 and 3.87 Å\n−1\n, respectively, suggesting that Aza-CMP-Co exists as mononuclear metal centres after OER \n). Notably, the redox features and catalytic current density of Aza-CMP-Co are preserved after 400 CV scans in various electrolytes, revealing good stability of single-site cobalt toward OER under broad pH conditions (Supplementary \n). For Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated), aggregation of the cobalt component was observed in EDX elemental mapping images –l\n\nMethods\nfor definition of borate and phosphate reaction order, ρ\n[borate]\nand ρ\n[phosphate]\n). The diffusion-controlled solution APT process is influenced by the concentration of external anions in the electrolyte, and first-order reactions with respect to the anions are widely observed in catalyst-modified electrodes when the RDS of OER proceeds through the APT pathway \n)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. For borate buffer, the anion effect is absent at pH 11.0 and 13.3 but pronounced at pH 7.7 –d\n). The ρ\n[borate]\nfor the cobalt sites is approximately 0.5–0.7 over the entire catalytic potential range under pH 7.7 electrolyte. Similarly, ρ\n[phosphate]\nfor cobalt sites is approximately 0.4–0.5 under pH 7.0 conditions (Supplementary \n). Considering the relatively small KIE\nH/D\nvalue under near-neutral conditions (~1.8) and the presence of nearby uncoordinated N sites in Aza-CMP, the solution APT process—combined with a second-coordination-sphere-involved proton transfer process—occurs at cobalt sites under neutral conditions\n\n. However, the ρ\n[borate]\nvalues for pH 11.0 and 13.3, as well as the ρ\n[phosphate]\nvalues for pH 12.6, are close to zero over the entire catalytic potential range. By contrast, the reaction order with respect to phosphate (ρ\n[phosphate]\n) for cobalt hydroxide is calculated at ~0.4 under pH 12.6 conditions, indicating different reaction mechanisms from those of Aza-CMP-Co and closer involvement of anions in RDS (Supplementary \n). As the counterpart of anions, cations also show significant interactions with the active oxygenated intermediates generated in OER. Alkaline earth cations disturb the hydrogen bond network of water molecules\n\n, thereby influencing the interaction with surface intermediates\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Meanwhile, cations possess different solvation strengths (Li\n+\n> Na\n+\n> K\n+\n). The kinetics associated with the nucleophilic attack of water on oxidized electrophilic species decreases with increasing solvation strength\n\n. Because the cation effect is related to interaction of the cation with active oxygenated species, the oxidation behaviour of Aza-CMP-Co was studied by LSV in 1.0 M MOH (M, Li, Na and K) and 0.5 M MBi solutions. As shown in \n, for OER in borate buffers, activity decreased between alkaline cations K\n+\n\nmethods\nAtomic force microscope techniques were performed in dynamic mode using a Cypher ES system operating at room temperature under ambient air conditions. A commercial Oxford probe (no. HQ-150-Au) was used with a nominal force constant of 8 N m\n−1\n. The surfaces used for AFM experiments were SiO\n\n/Si. AFM images were processed using Gwyddion software. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) experiments were carried out using a low-temperature qPlus-equipped commercial Omicron LT-STM (Omcron LT-STM QPlus pre4) at 4.2 K. As-synthesized Aza-CMP was deposited on the pre-cleaned Au substrate by in situ thermal evaporation under ultra-high vacuum condition. The STM image was obtained at a sample bias of 0.2 V and a tunnelling current of 50 pA. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K with a Micromeritics 3Flex adsorption analyser. Samples were degassed in a vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method was applied to calculate specific surface areas. The NLDFT models were used to determine the porosity of samples in SAIEUS software. XRD studies were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance Power X-Ray Diffractometer (Cu–Kα radiation,\nλ\n= 1.5418 Å). The morphology and composition of the fabricated films were characterized using a Hitachi field-emission scanning electron microscope (Regulus 8230) and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector (Oxford Ultim EXTREME). HAADF–STEM images and EDX mapping were collected on a JEM ARM-200F and FEI Talos F200X field-emission transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Surface composition of electrode films was investigated using XPS on an ESCALAB Xi\n+\n(Thermo Scientific). Raman spectroscopy was measured using a DXR Microscope (Thermo Fisher) and FT–IR with a Nicolet 6700 Flex (Thermo Fisher). High-resolution, solid-state NMR (SS-NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer at Larmor frequency of 125.7 MHz using a 4 mm broadband cross-polarization magic angle-spinning (MAS) probe head. Alanine was used as an external reference (178 ppm)\n\n. The MAS sample spinning rate was 8 kHz. Cross-polarization was applied at a contact pulse duration of 1 ms and recycle delay of 5 s. A total of 2,740 transients were needed for a good signal-to-noise ratio. The concentration of Co was measured using ICP–OES with a Thermo Scientific iCAP 6000 series instrument. Samples on electrodes were digested in 1 ml of aqua regia with ultrasonication in a closed vessel and then diluted ten times to make a sample solution. Co standard solutions were measured prior to sampling, to calibrate and obtain standard curves. Co concentrations were determined using four different wavelengths: 231.1, 235.3, 237.8 and 238.8 nm, with average concentrations obtained at different wavelengths taken for data evaluation. Faraday efficiency measurements were carried out with an Omega PXM409 pressure transducer and a laboratory-made H-cell. EXAFS measurements were carried out on samples at beamline 07A1 of Taiwan Light Source at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center. This beamline adopts a fixed-exit, double-crystal Si monochromator to provide X-ray energy in the range 5–23 keV. The end-station was equipped with three ionization chambers and a Lytle detector for transmission and fluorescence-mode X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The beam size of the X-ray used on samples was ~0.5 × 0.25 mm (H × V), with flux >1 × 1,010 photons s\n−1\n. XAFS Co K-edge readings were collected at this beamline. Data were collected in fluorescence mode using a Lytle detector, while the corresponding reference sample was collected in transmission mode. Samples were ground and uniformly daubed on special adhesive tape. Raw EXAFS data were analysed according to standard procedures with ATHENA software packages.

The excess organic linker and metal sources were removed by washing the product three times with absolute ethanol. After drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight, Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursor was directly heat-treated in Ar gas (99.99% purity) at 1,000 °C for 1 h to derive the final Fe–N–C catalyst. Atomically dispersed Fe atoms were uniformly distributed on the N–C framework without further acid washes. The weight of Fe loading in the final catalyst was around 2.0 wt%.\nAccording to our previous work, impregnation of Fe–N–C with an ultralow Pt loading could significantly promote the durability of Fe–N–C, but it did not present a noticeable activity improvement, especially in the kinetic region\n\n. In this follow-up work, ammonia heat treatment was designed to expose more active sites and tailor the properties of the carbon support and the coordination number of single atoms. Secondary Ar pyrolysis after ammonia treatment is designed to stabilize the carbon framework. Thus, Fe-doped ZIF-8 was used as the support for Pt impregnation in this work to simplify heat treatment protocols. Pt(II) acetylacetonate (10 mg) was homogeneously dispersed in 3 ml of ethanol via ultrasonication until the solvent became transparent. In the meantime, 110 mg of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol was added to the Pt solution to provide a sufficient nitrogen source for Pt coordination. Around 400 mg of Fe-doped ZIF-8 was added to the above solution to form a uniform suspension. After drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight, the solid was collected and ball milled (ZrO\n\nball, 350 revolutions per minute (r.p.m.), 4 h) to uniformly distribute Pt and N sources on the Fe-doped ZIF-8 support. The mixed precursors were first treated in NH\n\ngas at 900 °C for 15 min and then transferred to an Ar atmosphere at 1,000 °C for 1 h to remove Zn in the precursor and stabilize the whole carbon framework to produce the final catalyst, Pt-Fe-N-C. The Pt and Fe loadings were around 1.7 and 2.0 wt%, respectively.\nAs a reference electrocatalyst, Pt–N–C was prepared from a ZIF-8 support, which was formed by mixing 1 mM Zn(NO\n\nO and 8.21 g of 2-methylimidazole in a methanol solvent and following the same collecting and drying protocols as for Fe-doped ZIF-8. Similarly, 10 mg of platinum(II) acetylacetonate was homogeneously dispersed in 3 ml of ethanol via ultrasonication until the solvent became transparent. In the meantime, 110 mg of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol was added to the Pt solution to provide a sufficient nitrogen source for Pt coordination. Around 400 mg of ZIF-8 was added to this solution to form a uniform suspension. After drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight, the solid was collected and ball milled (ZrO\n\nball, 350 r.p.m., 4 h) to uniformly distribute the Pt and N sources on the ZIF-8 support. The mixed precursors were also initially treated in NH\n\ngas at 900 °C for 15 min and then transferred into an Ar atmosphere at 1,000 °C for 1 h. The final catalyst, Pt–N–C, had a Pt loading of 2.3 wt%.\nPhysical characterization\nThe TEM results were collected with a double Cs-corrected FEI Themis G2 operating at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan Enfina EELS, the collection angle of HAADF detector was 60–200 mrad and the probe current was controlled at around 150 pA. The convergence semi-angle and collection semi-angle of EELS are 25 and 36.2 mrad, respectively. The acquisition time of EELS is limited to 0.1 s per pixel, so a Fischione 2550 Cryo Transfer Tomography Holder was used to minimize the jumping of single atoms. The structures of Pt-Fe-N-C were examined by an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, X’pert Pro) equipped with a graphite monochromator and a Cu Kα radiation source. Bulk and surface compositions were evaluated through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Agilent Technologies, Agilent 7900) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Kratos Analytical, Axis Ultra DLD), respectively. The surface area of the catalyst was measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method (Quantachrome Instruments, AUTOSORB-1). XAS characterizations, which included X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, were performed at beamline 20-BM of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, using a Si monochromator. XAS data were processed with the ATHENA and ARTEMIS software packages. The\n\nCo/Rh source in transmission geometry. The data were fitted by using the MOSSWINN 4.0 software.

However, the mesoporous structure of SACs, which is beyond the atomic scale of the active sites, is often overlooked but could impact the catalytic performance, especially under practical operation conditions. Using SAC electrocatalysis as an example, within low current density regions, mass diffusions are usually not problematic, and the catalytic performance is dominated by the intrinsic activity of the single atomic site as well as its density\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n. Once the reaction rates approach the industrially relevant range (>100 mA cm\n−2\n), the mass diffusion of reactants or products, which is usually determined by the microscale structures (nanopores or nanochannels) around the active site, could play an even more important role than the active site itself. While previous SAC synthesis methods have demonstrated excellent control in the single atomic site structure, very few studies have reported additional tunability in the microscopic structure surrounding the atomic sites for SACs.\nHere we report a general SAC synthesis method with flexible control in both the atomic structure of the single atomic site as well as the mesoporous structure of the carbon support for optimized catalytic performance. Assisted by different types of hard templates, we successfully fabricated a family of M-SACs (M = Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) as well as multi-M-SACs including binary, ternary, quaternary and up to seven different metal centres. More importantly, by tuning the mesoporous structure of the hard template, we were able to control the mass diffusions in the carbon matrix in a three-dimensional (3D) or two-dimensional (2D) manner, and thus gained a control in the catalyst’s reaction activity especially under large reaction rates.

TEM images successfully confirmed that the mesoporous structures we observed in Ni-SACs could be well maintained when the Ni centre was changed to other metals (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). X-ray diffraction patterns suggested no detectable metal particles in all the prepared M-SACs (Supplementary \n). The atomic dispersion of different metals was further confirmed by STEM –h\nand Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n) and EDS mapping (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n) images as well as EXAFS spectra (Supplementary \n) with a loading ranging from 1.76 to 4.11 wt% (Supplementary \n), suggesting the versatility of our hard-template method in synthesizing different single atomic sites without metal clusters or nanoparticles. All the metal centres showed an oxidation state between the metallic and oxide counterparts, as shown by the XANES spectra (Supplementary \n), which can be explained by the M–N coordination environment confirmed by EELS point spectra (Supplementary Figs.\n\n–\n\n). It is believed that the principle governing the formation of SACs for different metal elements (M = Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, Cu, Sc and Fe) by our methods is as follows: Highly stable M–N bonds form during the pyrolysis of M-P\n\nsynthesis of various unary M-SACs, we further extended our hard-template synthesis strategy to different combinations of multi-M-SACs, represented by binary NiCo-SAC, ternary NiCoMn-SAC, quaternary NiCoMnZn-SAC, quinary NiCoMnZnCu-SAC, senary NiCoMnZnCuSc-SAC and up to septenary NiCoMnZnCuScFe-SAC.

Here we use electrocatalytic CO\n\nsynthesis strategy enables us to obtain M-SACs with different types of porous structures for a better control of internal mass diffusions.

                "input": "How to synthesize On 12 May 2025 This article has been updated Abstract Photocatalytic oxidation represents an effective means of hydrocarbon valorization, but achieving high-selectivity intermediate products at high substrate conversion remains challenging. Here single-atom Pd–O catalytic sites with different coordination environments are synthesized. The Pd–O 3 coordinated single sites show the best catalytic performance for selective toluene oxidation, exhibiting a high benzaldehyde selectivity of 95% at 95% toluene conversion, and a benzaldehyde yield rate up to 12,000 μmol g −1 h −1 , surpassing previously reported results. The Pd–O 3 catalytic sites serve as the location of photogenerated charge separation and C( sp 3 )–H bond activation. These sites can trap the photogenerated holes effectively to enhance the charge-separation efficiency, improving the yield rate by a factor of 2.9 relative to the Bi 2 WO 6 support. Additionally, the coordination structure weakens benzaldehyde adsorption, reducing overoxidation and improving reaction selectivity. This work highlights the importance of single-atom site coordination in optimizing the activity and selectivity of photocatalytic oxidation reactions.

First, CoSO\n\n, dicyandiamide, glucose and sodium chloride (NaCl) were dissolved in water and then freeze dried to encapsulate Co ions and other molecules within NaCl crystal lattice. Afterwards, the resulting mixture was annealed at 900 °C in an argon atmosphere, leading to the carbonization of glucose to form a graphene network between the salt lattice to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) Co-SAC nanosheets–NaCl mixture. Notably, the size of NaCl increased during the high-temperature carbonization process, thereby expediting the formation of interpenetrating nanosheets at the boundaries of salt particles and securing a high carbon yield due to the confined carbonization between NaCl terminals. At annealing temperatures above the melting point of NaCl (801 °C), molten NaCl facilitated the capture of Cl by Co atoms, introducing Cl into the Co centre.

As results, a series of nitrogen (N)-doped, S-doped and N–S co-doped carbon-based catalysts without or with Co single sites were synthesized by varying the added precursors of heteroatoms and Co salts (correspondingly denoted as CN, C/S, CN/S and Co\n\nsynthesis, which not only encapsulated the ultrathin layers of glucose to construct highly porous materials but also constrained the carbonization process to prevent the aggregation of Co species for single-atom formation. Consequently, we provided a facile and mass-production strategy for Co\n\nsynthesis at the molecular level and mechanistic insights of structure–activity relations of this work will not only enlighten the intelligent design of reaction-oriented single-atom materials for high intrinsic activity in green catalysis but also unlock their potential for practical applications in environmental remediation."

Then, magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)\n\n) was added to the mixture, which was ultrasonicated for another 30 min and then dried using a rotary evaporator. The obtained solid was dried in an oven at 60 °C and then calcined in nitrogen at 700 °C. The calcined product was washed with 1 M nitric acid, centrifuged and dried to obtain Fe–N–C. Similarly, Co–N–C was synthesized using essentially the same method but with cobalt acetate instead of Fe(acac)\n\nsamples were prepared using a simple method, as detailed in the Supplementary Information.\nPollutant degradation for wastewater treatment\nThe model pollutant solution or wastewater was first prepared, and a certain amount of Fe–N–C was added. If necessary, the pH of the reaction solution was adjusted to the target value using NaOH or HCl. The mixture was stirred well to evenly distribute the components, and PMS was then added. At the required time, the sample was removed from the reaction solution, filtered and detected in a timely manner.\nLong-term degradation experiment\nThe catalyst (20 mg) was introduced before the start of the reaction. To 100 ml of the reaction solution, 20 mg l\n−1\nof phenol and 20 mg of PMS were added during each reaction cycle, and the phenol concentration in the reaction solution was measured at the end of each cycle. Three long-term degradation cycles were conducted daily. When the catalyst became deactivated, it was washed with ethanol and reused for pollutant degradation.\nMeasurement of CODs for catalyst and reaction solution\nFor measuring the COD of the solution, 3 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and filtered, and 2 ml of the filtrate was used as the sample. For measuring the COD of catalyst, 50 ml of the reaction mixture was membrane filtered, and the powder was collected and ultrasonically redispersed in an equal volume of pure water. Subsequently, 2 ml of the dispersion was used as the sample for measuring the COD.\nData availability\nThe data that support the conclusions of this study are available within the manuscript and Supplementary information."
