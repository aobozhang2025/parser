CeO was purchased from US research nanomaterials with the surface area of 35-70 m2/g. Prior to each catalyst preparation, the support powder was calcined in air at 400 oC for 10 h, then stored in dark vacuum. All other chemicals, including Au(OH), HAuCl, NaOH pellets, and (NH ) CO, were supplied by Alfar Aesar. 3 4 4 2 3 The Au/TiO sample made by deposition precipitation (DP) was used as reference. Typically, 150 mL of HAuCl 2 4 aqueous solution was added into a 250 mL water suspension of 5 g titania. After stirring the slurry for 1 h, 1 mol/L of (NH ) CO solution was slowly added to keep the pH around 8. The slurry was heated to 70 oC and aged for 1 h. 4 2 3 The fresh samples were obtained by filtering the slurry, continuously washing with 70 oC water, then drying in vacuum at room temperature (RT) overnight. The obtained powder catalysts were calcined at 200 oC for 2 h (ramping rate: 2 oC/min) to obtain the 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO (DP) sample. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy confirmed the gold loading as 4.8 wt.%. The as prepared catalysts were stored in dark vacuum before any activity tests and characterization. To prepare the Au -O -Na -(OH) solution, the proper amount of Au(OH) powder was suspended in 30 mL of H O 1 x 9 y 3 2 with O sparging and heated up to 80 oC. NaOH powder (atomic ratio of Au:Na=1:9) was added into the slurry at the same temperature. The mixture was refluxed at 80 oC overnight to get a transparent solution (colorless at lower concentrations – light yellow at higher concentrations). The atomic ratio of the Au:Na was set at 1:9 in order to have multi-coordinated Au –O -Na clusters to adequately stabilize the cationic gold atom, as determined experimentally 1 x and by DFT calculations published recently1. The gold solution did not precipitate at 80 oC and was stable under constant stirring during two weeks of observation. The Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO catalysts were prepared by IWI of the gold solution at room temperature (RT) in air. The 1 x 9 y 2 solution was concentrated by heating followed by drying at 200°C with N protection, and then the sample was further dried in vacuum overnight at 80°C. The powder samples were stored in dark vacuum before any activity tests and characterization. Au and Na are all in cationic form in the unsupported powder (Supplementary -2). The gold loading was checked by ICP as 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt.% for the 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO catalysts, 1 x 9 y 2 respectively. Supplementary shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the gold/titania catalysts prepared by the two methods (DP and IWI). Anatase is the only detectable phase for all three samples. The average particle sizes of the anatase determined by XRD in 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO (DP), 0.5 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO, and 1.0 wt.% 2 1 x 9 y 2 Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO are 9.8, 10.1, and 9.7 nm respectively. Supplementary shows the X-ray photoelectron 1 x 9 y 2 spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Ti2p for the samples made by DP and IWI. Irrespective of the methods employed, the TiIV as in anatase TiO is the only chemical state of the titanium observed. Therefore, we conclude that the different preparation methods do not introduce any significant modification to the support oxides. The important physical properties of the three key samples in this paper 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO (DP), 0.5 wt.% Au -O - 2 1 x Na -(OH) /TiO, and 1.0 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO are summarized in Supplementary PDF, and DRIFTS) The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the samples were measured by single-point N adsorption and desorption cycles in a Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 instrument. XRD analysis was performed on a PANalytical X’Pert Pro instrument. Cu Kα radiation was used with a power setting of 45 kV and 40 mA. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field (AC-HAADF) images for the Au catalysts were obtained at the Advanced Microscopy Laboratory at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, using a JEOL 2200FS instrument equipped with a hexapole corrector (CEOS GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) on the illuminating lenses, for scanning transmission (STEM) imaging. The corrector permits imaging in HAADF mode at a nominal resolution of 0.07 nm, with a collection semi-angle of 26.5 mr and a beam current of ~30 pA. To easily reveal single gold atoms on catalysts dispersed by dry-dipping onto holey- carbon-coated TEM grids, images were typically recorded at 10Mx direct magnification, at 512×512 px with a 32 or 64 microsecond dwell time, to give 8.5 or 17 sec scan times. Because the nanoparticles and sub-nm species have almost equal chance to be imaged on the thin and flat support surfaces, the gold species (> 150 total counts) near the edge of the samples in different regions were counted and analyzed. Bulk elemental composition was determined by ICP and SEM/EDS. The supported Au/TiO catalysts were dissolved in concentrated HCl or aqua regia at 80°C with reflux condensation and analyzed by ICP. Instrument- Zeiss Supra55VP FE-SEM was used for SEM. Imaging conditions are: 1.5 kV, 10-micron aperture, working distance of 4 mm, InLens and Everhart Thornley detectors. EDS conditions are: 20 kV, 120-micron aperture; working distance 8.5 mm, operated in low vacuum mode at chamber pressure of 30 Pa, EDAX Apollo 40 detector. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data were collected in the fluorescence mode with a 13-channel Ge detector at the12-BM APS beamline at Argonne National Laboratory. The X-ray absorption edge energy for Au LIII edge was calibrated to 11919 eV by a gold foil. For each collection point, three consecutive scans (each lasting ~ 30 min) were acquired after the sample was treated at the reaction conditions (10 mg sample, 15 mL/min flowrate) to reach steady- state as monitored by a mass spectrometer connected to the gas outlet, and cooled to liquid N temperature in He flow to freeze the structure and the charge of the gold. The reference spectra of AuIII and Au0 (i.e. Au(OH), and gold foil) were collected at RT in static air. The Feff models of gold foil, Au O, NaAuO 2, AuTi 3, were used to fit the 1st shell 2 3 2 3 Au-Au, Au-O, and Au-Ti coordination in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data. XPS was performed on a Thermo Scientific Al Kα-XPS. The C1s peak was calibrated at 284.8 eV. High energy X-ray scattering data suitable for pair distribution function (PDF) analysis were collected at beamline 11-ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory using an X-ray wavelength of 0.2113 Å. X- ray PDFs were extracted within pdfgetX2 after calibrating and integrating the X-ray scattering images within gsas-ii. A bulk metallic Au impurity in the samples was modelled within pdfgui and subtracted from the measured PDF data to isolate the contribution from the Au catalyst species. Gaussian functions were fit to features of interest to evaluate the peak positions and areas. For in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a DTGS KBr detector and a Harrick praying mantis HVC-DRP4 cell equipped with KBr windows. After each sample was placed in the cell, it was heated to 200 oC under pure He for 30 min and was then gradually cooled to RT. During cooling, background spectra were recorded at 160°C and RT. Subsequently the flow was changed to the desired conditions and the respective spectra were recorded in two regions 3100-2650 cm-1 and 1800- 1300 cm-1. Resolution was selected to 4 cm-1 and a number of 500 scans were recorded for each spectrum. After the aforementioned initial treatment and background collection, spectra were recorded after: (i) treatment with methanol-saturated He flow for 15 min at RT, (ii) subsequent purge with pure He flow for 15 min, (iii) treatment with methanol-saturated He flow for 30 min at reaction temperature (160°C) after (b), (iv) cooling to room temperature under pure He flow after (iii), (v) subsequent purging with pure He flow at 160°C for 0.5 h after (iv) and (vi) at 170°C for 2 h after (v)."

The catalyst made by the DP method has an average Au NP size of 6.2 nm, consistent with the coordination number of Au-Au as 9.4 from EXAFS fittings reported for this type of catalyst21. Activity Tests: Water-gas shift reaction In the WGS and the other reactions examined in this work, no degassing or activation of the catalyst was necessary prior to reaction. Owing to the high amount of the atomically-dispersed gold in the 1.0 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO 1 x 9 y 2 sample, this catalyst shows high overall activity for low-temperature WGS reaction (Supplementary. We titrated the number of such –OH groups by CO-TPR, and found that the amount of regenerable –OH species in the 0.5 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO catalyst is actually twice that of the 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO (DP) catalyst containing 1 x 9 y 2 2 almost 10 times more gold. The abundance of these -OH groups also translates into proportionally higher overall reaction rates (Supplementary. The 3rd consecutive cycle CO-TPR profiles for sodium ion-stabilized gold/titania catalysts are shown in Supplementary stoichiometric reduction of –OH by CO molecules to produce CO and H simultaneously. The light-off temperature 2 2 for H matches well with the reaction onset around 60 oC in product-free conditions (10 % CO - 3 % H O- He, 30 2 2 ml/min, 100 mg sample, 5 oC/min) as shown in Supplementary and Supplementary improved WGS catalytic activity. As long as the gold species are atomically dispersed, when the amount of single- gold atoms was doubled (from 0.5 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO to 1.0 wt.% Au -O -Na -(OH) /TiO ), the amount 1 x 9 y 2 1 x 9 y 2 of regenerable –OH and the low-temperature WGS reaction rate were also doubled (Supplementary -11). In agreement with our previous findings1, the –OH vicinal to the atomic gold centers initiate the low-temperature WGS reaction. Single Au atom catalysts synthesized by different methods from various precursors share very close turnover frequency (TOF) as shown in Supplementary, which indicates that [Au -O ] species is the intrinsic active site 1 x for WGS. If the active species is formed, the supports do not have a direct role for WGS, which is corroborated by WGS temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) on unsupported Au -O -Na -(OH) (Supplementary. 1 x 9 y The activity of the supported sodium ion-stabilized gold oxo-cluster WGS catalysts is stable up to 200 oC during two cycles of 10 h-each test with shutdown of the reaction in 3 % water vapor to RT (Supplementary.

Therefore, HCOO formation on Au sites holds precedence in relevant reactions, irrespective of the support (or the lack thereof). This is problematic, since the dehydrogenation of this dioxy-methylene species to formate has been found to be exothermic on all clusters studied in this work. Therefore, dioxy-methylene species is a precursor of formate formation. Not only is formate not a direct reaction intermediate in methanol dehydrogenation, but it also significantly lowers the Bader charge on Au, turning Au anionic in the presence of two HCOO groups on Au -O - 1 7 Na -(OH), and in the presence of a single HCOO group on all other three cluster models, (see Supplementary 2 34).

Photoluminescence (PL) emission studies (Supplementary ) of the as-prepared carbon suspension presents an excitation-dependent PL, confirming the successful preparation of GQDs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and X-ray diffraction suggest that the GQDs are well crystallized, with a uniform size of ~6–8 nm and Supplementary Figs. and ). Obviously, the GQDs with different particle sizes and functional groups could affect the metal loading of single-atom catalysts (details in Supplementary Figs. and ). With the decreasing of the size of GQDs, the concentration of the surface functional group will be increased due to its enhanced surface/volume ratio and thus lead to a higher concentration of anchored single metal atoms. So, theoretically, the smaller it is, the better. However, if the size of GQDs is too small, effective steric hindrance cannot be provided to prevent the agglomeration of metal sites between different GQDs. The optimized size of the GQDs is within ~5–10 nm in our case. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the as-prepared GQDs shows a high nitrogen content of 10.8 at.% (Supplementary ).

Only an oxidized iridium specie in the form of Ir δ + (iridium 4 f 7/2 peak at 61.9 eV) was detected until the Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, followed by the arising of metallic iridium (iridium 4 f 7/2 peak at 60.8 eV) from Ir–N–C-8 to Ir–N–C-15 ( ). It is worthwhile to note that the oxidation state of iridium in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst is very close to that of IrO (+4), where the iridium 4 f 7/2 peak of IrO is located at 61.6 eV ( ). According to the XPS results, our Ir–N–C-7 catalyst has an iridium loading of 37.6 wt% (3.84 at.%) and nitrogen content of 27.8 at.%, consistent with the nominal iridium loading of ~41 wt%. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was performed to investigate the distribution of iridium species at the atomic scale in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst. As illustrated in –d, densely while atomically dispersed iridium atoms on a highly porous carbon support were observed in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, with no clusters observed. The homogeneously dispersed bright spots are ~0.2 nm in size, matching with the theoretical size of metal atoms. The simultaneous acquisition of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results with the beam positioned on a bright atom, shown in Supplementary, revealed Ir, N and C and suggested possible coordination of Ir–N–C. EDS mapping analysis further demonstrates the homogeneous distribution of iridium, nitrogen and carbon (Supplementary ) and gives an iridium content of 44.5 wt%. More importantly, a wide-range HAADF-STEM screening was performed to confirm that there are no iridium clusters or nanoparticles in high-loading Ir–N–C samples (Supplementary Figs. and ). However, nanoparticles were observed when the iridium loading was further increased to Ir–N–C-8 (Supplementary ), agreeing well with the XPS analysis. Considering the limited solubility of iridium in corrosive aqua regia solution, we employed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to accurately obtain the iridium loading in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst of 41.6 ± 2.5 wt% (Supplementary ).

As shown in and Supplementary, while both ~7.5 wt% Ni–N–C-1.5 and ~15 wt% Ni–N–C-3 show an outstanding CO selectivity of over 90%, their activities differ dramatically. Specifically, under a cell voltage of ~2.55 V, ~15 wt% Ni–N–C-3 catalyst can deliver a CO partial current of 122 mA cm −2, which represents a 2.5-fold improvement from ~7.5 wt% Ni–N–C-1.5 ). In addition, we performed HADDF-STEM analysis on the postcatalysed Ni–N–C-3 catalyst (Supplementary ). We did not observe any agglomeration during the CO reduction reaction, demonstrating the good stability of our high-loading single-atom catalysts. This result clearly demonstrates the advantage of high single-atom loadings in improving single-atom catalysis. Pushing the metal loading in single-atom catalysts to the limit will play a critical role in the catalysts’ practical applications. Our GQD-assisted synthesis strategy sets up a limit of TM single-atom density before the formation of clusters or nanoparticles. Fine tuning of the quantum dot functional group, TM coordination environment and TM centre will be future directions to further increase the single-atom loading and improve the catalytic performances of single-atom catalysts in different reaction applications."

The EDS elemental mapping shows the uniform distribution of platinum, nitrogen and carbon in Pt–N–C-6 (Supplementary ). The EELS and EDS scans on a single platinum site (Supplementary ) further reveal the expected platinum, nitrogen and carbon signals in Pt–N–C-6. The deconvolution of platinum 4 f spectra (Supplementary ) demonstrates that the isolated platinum in Pt–N–C-6 catalyst is in the oxidized valence state, with the Pt 4 f 7/2 peak located at 72.5 eV, which is higher than that of metallic Pt (4 f 7/2 at 71.1 eV)"

In an alkaline electrolyte, we performed the electrochemical H O production of Co –NG(O) catalysts at 25°C (Supplementary gives details on the effect of reaction temperature). Co –NG(O) showed a very high H O productivity of 418 ±19 mmol g cat −1 h −1 (at 50 mA; Supplementary and Supplementary Figs. and ), which is more than twice the amount of H O produced by a Au–Pd catalyst in direct synthesis, which demonstrates the feasibility of electrochemical H O production. Our optimized Co –NG(O) catalyst could produce a H O concentration of 5,812 ppm (suitable for applications that require diluted H O solutions) after 24 hours using our custom-made H-type cell, which contains 10 ml of catholyte (Supplementary ). Furthermore, the Co –NG(O) catalyst is stable throughout the entire pH level for a long-term production of H O, notably with a 98.7% activity retention over 110 hours at 0.65 V in alkaline conditions ). This confirms that the highly active Co–N (O) moieties are very stable in either alkaline or acidic environments for the H O production (Supplementary ). Under the harsh condition of a higher overpotential (at 0.55 V), Co –NG(O) still retains its excellent stability with little chemical and structural change (Supplementary Figs. and ). When the reaction temperature is raised, the overall ORR kinetics and the H O selectivity increase, whereas the produced H O decomposes more rapidly (Supplementary ). Cobalt is commonly known to be less reactive to Fenton reactions when compared to iron-based catalysts, which suffer from poor stability. Recently, cobalt and manganese SACs were reported as good alternatives to iron-based electrocatalysts to prevent the serious degradation by Fenton reactions,. Thus, the high stability in a wide pH range and the substantially enhanced H O production activity can be simultaneously achieved by our design strategy of electron-poor cobalt metal centres modulated by the surrounding atomic configuration.

Through experiments and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the surrounding atomic configuration of SACs mediates the H O production activity of metal centres. Owing to the diverse synthetic methods of Co–N structures, there has been a debate on the reaction mechanism for ORR (a 2e − or 4e − pathway) regarding the Co–N structure,. Thus, it is highly desirable to discover which physical factor regulates the catalytic activity and selectivity in atomic precision. Our strategy allows the fine-tuning of the heterogeneous catalytic activity for H O production over a wide pH range, which results in a kinetic current density of 2.8 ± 0.2 mA cm −2 (at 0.65 V) and a mass activity of 155 ±6 A g −1 (at 0.65 V) with negligible activity loss over 110 hours in basic condition. Our highly active and stable SAC that comprises non-precious metals is easily scalable (Supplementary ) and our concept can be generalized to other carbon materials (Supplementary gives details), which opens up the possibilities for industrially viable electrochemical H O production.

It is worth noting that in most carbon-based SA systems oxygen quickly evaporates at 800°C or above. If we had built the library at high temperatures, we would have been less likely to reveal the positive correlation between SA loading and oxygen. It is also important to note that correlation does not mean causality. Our in situ investigation does indeed suggest that oxygen plays an important role in anchoring SAs on carbon at low temperatures and that nitrogen replaces oxygen only at higher temperatures, as oxygen evaporates more easily than nitrogen."

Dozens of single-atom catalysts have been developed, and they exhibit notable catalytic activity and selectivity that are not achievable on metal surfaces. Although promising, there is limited knowledge about the boundaries for the monometallic single-atom phase space, not to mention multimetallic phase spaces. Here, single-atom catalysts based on 37 monometallic elements are synthesized using a dissolution-and-carbonization method, characterized and analysed to build the largest reported library of single-atom catalysts. In conjunction with in situ studies, we uncover unified principles on the oxidation state, coordination number, bond length, coordination element and metal loading of single atoms to guide the design of single-atom catalysts with atomically dispersed atoms anchored on N-doped carbon. We utilize the library to open up complex multimetallic phase spaces for single-atom catalysts and demonstrate that there is no fundamental limit on using single-atom anchor sites as structural units to assemble concentration-complex single-atom catalyst materials with up to 12 different elements. Our work offers a single-atom library spanning from monometallic to concentration-complex multimetallic materials for the rational design of single-atom catalysts.

Concentration-complex multimetallic SACs On the basis of the synthesis of the 37 mono-element SACs, the library suggests that the dissolution-and-carbonization strategy enables the chelation of different metal centres on glucose and their separation by glucose backbones, and thus we infer that the strategy can facilitate the formation of concentration-complex multiple metallic-element SAs in one sample. Then, by controlling the species and concentrations of multiple metal precursors, multimetallic SAs, such as 2-, 8- and 12-metal SACs, are successfully achieved, with their atomic dispersions verified by aberration-corrected STEM imaging and XAFS measurement –f and Supplementary Figs. 64–67 ). The 8- and 12-metal SACs with high metal loading are extremely difficult to synthesize because each metallic atom in the 8- and 12-metal SACs must overcome the aggregations with not only themselves but also any one of the other metallic atoms. However, we synthesized an eight-metal SAC containing V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn (Supplementary ) and a 12-metal SAC with Sc, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Pd, Hf and W and Supplementary Figs. 66–68 ). Atomic-resolution STEM images show that the SAs are all atomically and uniformly dispersed across the carbon support –d ), which is further confirmed by the XAFS spectra in and Supplementary, as well as the EXAFS fitting results in Supplementary and Supplementary. The contents and valence states of the SAs were determined by ICP-MS and XPS, respectively, as shown in, Supplementary and Supplementary. The total metal loading of the 12-metal SAC reaches 7.53 wt%, which is considered a high value. These results demonstrate that there is no fundamental limit on using SA anchor sites as structural units to assemble concentration-complex multimetallic SAC materials."

The EXAFS results, which represent the average of all the Pt in the sample, agreed with the characterization data reported above that indicated that the Pt@Al O -800 catalyst maintained a small Pt particle size, while the Pt NPs had sintered in the Pt/Al O -800 catalyst. The small discrepancies in the average particle sizes determined by EXAFS and TEM can be attributed to a change in the crystallinity and shape of the particles upon aging, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measuring the average coordination environment of the Pt NPs. Finally, XPS characterization of the aged Pt@Al O -800 did not show signals attributable to Pt, suggesting that the NPs remained encapsulated below the alumina surface, even after hydrothermal aging (Extended Data ). Kinetic rate measurements for propene combustion, normalized by the Pt mass, demonstrated the similar activity of the Pt@Al O and Pt/Al O catalysts (Extended Data ). The activation energies were 77 ± 6 and 57 ± 2 kJ mol −1 for Pt@Al O and Pt/Al O, respectively, clearly suggesting that the larger number of active sites in the encapsulated sample compensates for the higher activation barrier. These results demonstrate that the encapsulation process leaves most of the metal available for reaction, in contrast to previous studies where partial coverage of the catalytically active metal surface led to suppressed activity,,. We then performed CO chemisorption and CO oxidation measurements to further characterize the catalysts. CO chemisorption yielded similar Pt dispersion values of 8 and 9% for the as-prepared Pt@Al O and Pt/Al O, respectively (Supplementary ), confirming that the encapsulation process did not lead to a loss of available surface area. These values are lower than expected for 3.8 nm Pt NPs, which may be attributed to their interaction with the amorphous alumina support. Other studies have also reported low CO adsorption by supported Pt NPs despite their high CO oxidation activity,. Remarkably, the dispersion of the aged Pt@Al O -800 sample (7.5%) remained similar to the fresh sample, whereas it decreased drastically to 0.3% for the aged Pt/Al O -800 sample (Supplementary ). Thus, the CO chemisorption data further corroborate the sintering-resistant properties of the encapsulated catalyst. Despite the lower CO chemisorption capacity than expected, both Pt@Al O and Pt/Al O were similarly active in CO oxidation (Extended Data ). Together, all these results demonstrate that the activity–stability trade-off can be overcome using our proposed templated encapsulation strategy."

The surface energy of Pt was set to 110 meV Å −2 to obtain a simulated final diameter of 16.6 nm for Pt/Al O after 2 h at 800°C in 3 vol.% O, which is in line with the experimental value of 17.2 nm. In 10 vol.% O, the simulations predicted increased sintering, with a final Pt NP average diameter for Pt/Al O greater than 25 nm ), in line with the hypothesis of PtO (g) being the species responsible for sintering. At S eff = 1, the simulated sintering in the Pt@Al O catalyst was greatly reduced compared with the Pt/Al O sample due to increased adhesion between the Pt particles and the alumina in the encapsulated sample geometry. However, the predicted size of Pt@Al O after aging in 3 vol.% O matched the experimental results only for S eff < 0.1, indicating that further stabilization mechanisms are at play in this catalyst. To explore the effect of a higher oxygen concentration, we aged Pt@Al O in 10 vol.% O. The catalyst still maintained its activity ), in agreement with the computational model in which the encapsulation geometry leads to decreased PtO (g) vapour exchange, as expressed by a value of S eff of less than 0.01 in 10 vol.% O. The stability of the encapsulated Pt can therefore be explained by the combination of the higher adhesion energy and the lower rate of reactive surface collisions of PtO (g), which translate into slower sintering when Pt is embedded in the alumina framework. This result is also in line with the DRIFTS measurements, suggesting that the stabilization of under-coordinated Pt sites by alumina may reduce S eff, as reflected in the sintering simulations. final, as a function of the effective sticking coefficient, S eff, for Pt@Al O and Pt/Al O after aging at 800°C for 2 h in 3 and 10 vol.% O.

Our conclusion is that diffusion limitation is important for PtO sintering, but does not affect the transport of propene and oxygen to the active sites and, therefore, the reactivity, mainly because of the difference in the partial pressures of the low concentration of PtO in the gas phase and the much higher concentrations of reactants and products. Extension to Pt–Pd systems for increased stability We sought to further increase the thermal stability of the encapsulated sample by the addition of Pd to the catalyst formulation, which is known to reduce PtO volatility (Supplementary ). We prepared 3.5 nm Pd–Pt bimetallic NPs with a Pd/Pt atomic ratio of 1:1. HAADF-STEM characterization and EDS mapping confirmed the co-location of Pd and Pt in the encapsulated NPs –c and Supplementary Figs. – ). The EDS quantification of 0.06 at.% for both Pd and Pt is in excellent agreement with the synthesis. Total weight loadings of the metals of 0.86 wt% (Supplementary ) and 0.33 wt% (Supplementary Figs. and ) were quantified at two different locations by EDS. A higher metal loading than the overall loading of 0.5 wt% was due to the fact that bare alumina was also formed during the synthesis. The activity of the 800°C-aged PdPt@Al O (labelled PdPt@Al O -800) was similar to that of the as-prepared catalyst (Supplementary ). We then aged the catalyst under more demanding conditions at 1,100°C for 5 h in air (~21 vol.% O ) and steam (10 vol.%; Supplementary ). The sample maintained its activity, as evidenced by the overlapping light-off curves in. A control PdPt/Al O sample prepared by deposition of the same Pd–Pt NPs onto the alumina support was deactivated and drastically sintered after the severe aging treatment (Supplementary ). The pure Pt@Al O and Pd@Al O catalysts were also deactivated, demonstrating the importance of alloying (Extended Data ), in agreement with previous findings. The metal-free support was much less active after aging at 1,100°C, again indicating that the metal phase was responsible for the performance (Extended Data )., Representative HAADF-STEM image ( a ) and the corresponding EDS maps at the Pd K-edge ( b ) and Pt L -edge ( c ) of as-synthesized PdPt@Al O. d, Propene combustion activity on fresh PdPt@Al O and 1,100°C-aged PdPt@Al O.

The stability of two newly prepared anodes was further improved,f ): no obvious cell voltage increase was observed for these during 1,000 h stability tests. Additionally, much less black material was observed on the inner surface of the anolyte outlet tubes after stability tests compared with the initial trial (Supplementary ). RuO still showed much lower stability than Ni-RuO after electrode preparation optimization (Supplementary ). The faradaic efficiencies of O generated by the PEM–WE cell were measured as ~100% for Ni-RuO (Supplementary ). We monitored Ru dissolution from the Ni-RuO catalyst by ICP–MS during the 1,000 h stability test (Supplementary ). A rapid increase in Ru concentration was observed at the very beginning of the operation, which could be ascribed to the dissolution of unstable Ru species during the catalyst activation process. Ru dissolution was gradually stabilized within the first 500 h and remain nearly unchanged, at ~30 ppb, for the remainder of the stability test. Additionally, our Ni-RuO catalyst can also be stably operated under an elevated electrolyte temperature for >1,000 h without obvious performance degradation (Supplementary ). These stability results clearly demonstrate the great potential of our Ni-RuO catalyst for future practical applications. In summary, we developed a non-iridium-based acidic OER catalyst that can deliver at least 1,000 h of stability under a 200-mA cm –2 water-splitting current in a PEM–WE device. The findings in this work not only provide an effective method and new understanding to improving catalytic performance of the RuO catalyst, but also demonstrate its great future potential for implementation in practical PEM cells for large-scale clean H generation. While there is still a gap between our Ni-RuO catalyst’s stability performance and the typical industrial requirement (delivering >1 A cm −2 current for over 10 years of operation at 80°C), this encouraging milestone stability that we achieved using a Ru-based catalyst clearly suggests the potential of replacing Ir-based catalysts in the future. More studies can be carried out in the future to further improve the stability of Ru-based catalysts, such as temperature effects, multi-element doping and so on."

For 0.08% Pt /FeO x, an aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid and ferric nitrate (Fe(NO ) ·9H O, 1 mol l −1 ) was co-precipitated, with the pH value of the resulting solution controlled at about 8 by sodium carbonate at 50°C. The recovered solid was dried at 60°C overnight and calcined at 400°C for 5 h. Before characterization and reactivity testing, the samples were reduced in 10% H /He at 250°C for 0.5 h,.

The amount of Zn in these samples decreased from 12.47 wt% to 0.28 wt%, because the Zn vaporized under the high temperatures (Supplementary ). Characterizations of these samples are provided in Supplementary Figs. – and Supplementary. With vaporization of the Zn, the multi-point BET surface of Rh/CN increased from 790 to 1,339 m g −1 and the micropore volume of the Rh/CN increased from 0.310 to 0.550 cm g −1. The other characterizations show no obvious differences. The mass activity of Rh/CN-2 h (11.6 A mg −1 ) is much weaker than that of SA-Rh/CN (16.1 A mg −1 ). The mass activities of Rh/CN-4 h (16.3 A mg −1 ), Rh/CN-5 h (17.0 A mg −1 ) and Rh/CN-1100 (17.4 A mg −1 ) only exhibit a slight improvement (Supplementary ). These results suggest that excessive Zn in Rh/CN blocks the micropores in Rh/CN and thus has a negative effect on the catalytic properties and a small amount of Zn has negligible effect on catalytic performance. To evaluate the potential applications of SA-Rh/CN as an anode catalyst in DFAFCs, an integral fuel cell incorporated with SA-Rh/CN was assembled. SA-Rh/CN shows a high mass power density (522.1 mW mg −1; ), which is 8.8-fold higher than that of commercial Pd/C at 30°C (59.3 mW mg −1; Supplementary ). SA-Rh/CN also displays high power densities of 1,086.9 and 1,241.9 mW mg −1 at 60°C and 80°C, which are 14.8 and 14.1 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C (73.4 and 87.9 mW mg −1 respectively). The fuel cell performances at a fixed dimension of SA-Rh/CN and Pd/C show that the power density of SA-Rh/CN is lower than that of Pd/C (Supplementary Figs. and ), because the amount of precious metal in commercial Pd (30 wt%) is over 30 times higher than that in SA-Rh/CN (0.92 wt%). It is important to increase the metal loading of precious metal in SA-Rh/CN. Accordingly, a single cell test with Rh/CN-1100 (1.42 wt%) as anodic catalyst was performed. The power density of DFAFCs increases strikingly at 80°C to 86.6 mW cm −2, which is approaching that of Pd/C (105.4 mW cm −2 ), although the metal loading of Pd/C is still 21.4 times higher than that of Rh/CN-1100 (Supplementary ). Therefore, it is believed that single-atom Rh catalysts show tremendous potential in DFAFCs.

Full size image The overall iron loading determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was found to be ∼ 1.10 ± 0.03 wt% (Supplementary ), but the surface of individual GNPs was found to be nearly fully covered with single atoms. The main reason is that single atoms are only distributed on the surface of GNPs because of atomization by top-down abrasion. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Supplementary ) confirmed the existence of iron. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Supplementary ) indicated that there were no peaks from particulate iron in all samples. Only the graphite and facets were present. However, clusters and/or amorphous iron phases cannot be detected by X-ray diffraction, and therefore we employed low-resolution HADDF-STEM (Supplementary ) to confirm that there were no visible iron particles on the surface of the GNPs. The characteristics of the single atoms were verified by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The radial distribution function (RDF) derived from EXAFS results is shown in.

Full size image Conclusions We report a facile, solvent-free, zero-waste and low-cost method to prepare SACs. As-prepared single-atom metal–N–C catalysts showed competitive oxygen reduction reaction performance relative to commercial Pt@C (Supplementary ). Our strategy is not only applicable for metal–N–C systems (in which the metal can be iron, cobalt, nickel, copper or their alloys), but can also be easily extended to other supports. To demonstrate this, we also successfully synthesized SACs on some typical supports used in heterogeneous catalysis, such as oxides (MgO, SiO"

Subsequently, all samples were dried at 473 K (heating rate = 5 K min−1, hold time 12 h, static air) to yield the respective single-atom catalysts, denoted as M-SA/NC or M-SA/AC. In the case of Au, Pt, and Pd, single atoms with four-fold N-coordination (M- SA-N /NC) were obtained via thermal activation of the respective M-SA/NC samples (T = 1073 K, 4 act heating rate = 5 K min−1, 16 h, flowing N ). Nanoparticle-based M/C catalysts with varying particle sizes were derived via thermal activation in the temperature range of T = 523-1073 K (heating act rate = 5 K min−1, hold time 12 h, flowing N ). For each metal, a representative nanoparticle-based sample (M-NP/NC for Ru, Rh, Ir or M-NP/AC for all metals) was selected (i.e., the system with the highest activity for Ru-, Ir-, Rh-, and Pd-based catalysts and a sample of comparable particle size for Au and Pt- based catalysts). Catalysts after use in acetylene hydrochlorination for x-h time-on-stream (tos) are labeled M/C-xh. (III) Catalyst Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO-MPD diffractometer with Cu-K radiation ( = 1.54060 Å). The data was recorded in the 10-70° 2 range with an angular step size of 0.017° and a counting time of 0.26 s per step. Ar sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K in a Micromeritics 3Flex instrument, after degassing of the solids at 423 K for 12 h. Scanning transmission electron micrographs (STEM) with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector were acquired on an aberration-corrected HD2700CS (Hitachi) microscope operated at 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dipping the copper grid supporting a holey carbon foil in a suspension of the solid in ethanol and drying in air. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired on a Physical Electronics Quantum 2000 instrument using monochromatic Al-K radiation, generated from an electron beam operated at 15 kV, and equipped with a hemispherical capacitor electron-energy analyzer. The samples were analyzed at an electron take- off angle of 45° and a constant analyzer pass energy of 46.95 eV with a spectra resolution step width of 0.2 eV. The spectrometer was calibrated for the Au 4f signal at 84.0 ± 0.1 eV. The Au 4f, Pt 4f, Pd 3d, 7/2 Ru 3p, Rh 3d, and Ir 4f spectra were fitted by mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian component profiles after Shirley background subtraction. The selected peak positions are based on literature reported data. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were carried out at the SuperXAS beamline of the Swiss Light Source.2 The incident photon beam provided by a 2.9 T superbend magnet was selected by a Si channel-cut Quick-EXAFS monochromator.3 The rejection of higher harmonics and focusing were achieved with Rh-coated (for Ir-L, Pt-L, Au-L edges) and a Pt-coating (for Pd-K, Ru-K, and Rh-K 3 3 3 edges), respectively, at 2.5 mrad. The beamline was calibrated using the respective metal foils. The area of sample illuminated by the X-ray beam was 0.5 mm×0.2 mm. All spectra were recorded in transmission mode at room temperature. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were acquired with a 1 Hz frequency (0.5 s per spectrum) and then averaged over 10 min. The resulting raw data were processed using the ProQEXAFS software package.4 The EXAFS spectra were analyzed using the Demeter software package.5 Volumetric chemisorption of acetylene at 473 K (W = 0.1 g) was performed cat in a Micromeritics 3Flex Chemi instrument to quantify the amount of acetylene chemisorbed (V ) at chem reaction temperature.

Considering the former two, it is evident that E and E (M-oxide) are linearly dependent. This implies that the coh form origin of the diverging behavior of the Au (Au, Pt, Pd) and Ru (Ru, Rh, Ir) groups regarding their preferred formation of metallic or oxidic nanoparticles relates to their ability to form stable oxides. To assess the impact of the metal-host interactions in the M/C catalysts, DFT was employed. The model for the AC and NC supports was constructed from 16 distinct defects containing either N (pyrrolic, pyridinic, graphitic, oxo-pyridinic) or O (hydroxyl, epoxide, keto) heteroatoms (Supplementary, see Computational Methods for details) leading to 280 metal-carbon configurations. This thorough speciation analysis is based on stability of the single atoms, chlorinated single atoms, bulk metals and metal oxides (that identify thermodynamically stable configurations, Supplementary -15) coupled to matching the experimental characterization fingerprints, EXAFS (narrowing further the set of most likely models, Supplementary.

To stabilize isolated metal atoms with high and practical M loadings, the CeO x nanoislands must be ultrasmall (less than 2 nm), isolated and densely populated on high-surface-area supports, and M should be selectively deposited onto them. Thus, CeO x nanoislands were synthesized by strong electrostatic adsorption of charged species from aqueous solution ). The point of zero charge of SiO (278 m g −1 ) is 3–4 (refs., ), so that in an alkaline solution its zeta potential is negative.

During high-temperature calcination, atomically dispersed Ce species self-assemble into ultrasmall CeO x nanocrystallites. These ultrasmall, isolated CeO x nanoclusters act as functional nanoglues to localize metal atoms and to provide active oxygen species. By judiciously adjusting the aqueous solution pH so that CeO x nanoclusters are positively charged, negatively charged Pt-containing species selectively adsorb onto the CeO x nanoclusters.

This CO dissolution can be avoided in practical operations by continuously recycling the deionized water stream. The CO bubble formation within the PSE layer was found to have little impact on the middle-layer pressure or the device operational stability (Supplementary ). Furthermore, the recovered gas product was confirmed to be high-purity CO through gas chromatography analysis (up to 99.7% without considering water vapour; Supplementary ), allowing for direct integration with downstream utilization or storage processes without the typical energy-intensive secondary purification processes. No CO reduction gas or liquid products were detected during this carbon-capture process (Supplementary ). As shown in, with 13.9% CO concentration, the CO -capture rate increased almost linearly with the ORR current density ranging from 10 to 500 mA cm −2. By estimating the slope of the CO -capture (or crossover) rate as a function of the ORR current, we found that, for every two-electron transfer during which two OH − ions were generated, there was one CO molecule captured, suggesting that the CO crossover is mainly through the carbonate ion instead of bicarbonate because of the high local interfacial pH. This conclusion is supported by the well-matched CO -capture rates with the theoretical guideline, which assumes 100% carbonate crossover and is consistent with observations reported in previous studies,,,.

The FE carbonate was maintained over 90% across a wide range of cell currents under 13.9% CO, suggesting a high utilization efficiency of generated OH − ions. However, at high current densities, FE carbonate showed a slight decrease owing to the competition between the rate of carbonate formation and OH − migration. There were sufficient CO molecules around the catalyst–membrane interface at low current densities to react rapidly with the generated OH − ions before they were transported across the membrane by means of carbonate ions form. For high ORR currents, a large number of OH − ions were generated, depleting the surrounding CO molecules at a fast rate. This limits the mass diffusion of CO and allows some OH − ions to move directly across the AEM without reacting with CO molecules, resulting in lowered FEs.

Although some approximations were made and thus uncertainties were introduced, it was still helpful to understand the complexity of Rh speciation, and a set of representative structurally reasonable models were accordingly proposed (Supplementary ). It is known that even a small fraction of Rh species exposed on the external surface of zeolites may make a substantial contribution to the overall catalytic performance,. Despite the high efficiency in encapsulation of Rh into the MEL pores, the deposition of a small amount of Rh species on the external surface was still inevitable, which may have a negative impact on the regioselective hydroformylation of propene. On the basis of this rationale, we sought to use large organosulfur molecules to selectively poison the external Rh sites and only allow the hydroformylation reaction to take place within the zeolite channels. Specifically, 2,4-dimethylbenzenethiol (DMBT) was used as the ideal organosulfur molecule because its kinetic diameter (8.1 Å) exceeded the aperture width of MEL ) and thus its diffusion into the zeolite channels was probably restricted.

Our DFT calculations were carried out only at 4 MPa, which was same as the pressure chosen for the experimental studies, and we reasoned that such an option was appropriate.

To visualize the structure and distribution of the La species, we performed atomic-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping with single-atom sensitivity on an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM),. Direct discrimination of the La species from the Z-contrast STEM high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images is infeasible due to the small difference in La and Mo atomic numbers. Instead, atomic-scale STEM-EELS mapping using the characteristic La M-edge signals shows that the La signals are mostly confined within sparsely distributed single bright pixels of 0.2 nm (Supplementary ). Note that the pixel size we chose for STEM-EELS mapping is shorter than the La–La or the La–O–La bonds, indicating that most La species are atomically dispersed over γ-Mo N. Furthermore, the overlay of the La EELS map and the simultaneously acquired STEM-HAADF image shows that La species appears on the periphery of the projected profiles of the catalyst particles.

Following the same strategy, we developed a 0.2Pt/5La-Mo N catalyst with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading but a higher (5 wt%) La loading. The increased La nano-overlay coverage and atomically dispersed Pt species in this catalyst were verified by STEM-HAADF imaging and EELS mapping (Supplementary Figs. and ).

The electron ion interaction was described with the projector augmented wave method. The electron exchange and correlation energy were treated within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof function. A cutoff energy of 500 eV, force convergence lower than 0.02 eV Å −1 and Gaussian electron smearing method with σ = 0.1 eV were used. Brillouin zone sampling was employed using a Monkhorst–Pack grid. The nudged elastic band method was used to locate the transition states of the reactions. A single-layer periodic slab with (4 × 4) supercell g-C N was utilized, and all atoms were fully relaxed. The vacuum slab was set to 15 Å. PCN was modelled with a graphitic carbon atom of the pristine g-C N replaced by a phosphor atom (Supplementary ). The Pt surface was modelled using a four-layer slab with 15 Å vacuum slab and a (3 × 3) supercell (Supplementary ). The bottom two layers were fixed at the bulk position and the top two layers were fully relaxed for the calculations. The oxidation states of Co atoms are estimated by evaluating the Bader charges and by normalizing them to the Bader charges of bulk compounds with known oxidation states. For example, for phthalocyanine cobalt( ii ) (CoPc), where the Co is coordinated with four N atoms, and its coordination environment is close to Co /PCN in our work, the Bader charge of Co is 0.87 e. When normalizing to CoPc, the nominal oxidation state of 2.05 is obtained for the ex situ Co /PCN sample. Similarly, for the cobalt( ii ) hydroxo complex C H N OBCo, the Co is coordinated with three N atoms and one hydroxyl group, and its coordination environment is close to HO–Co /PCN (open-circuit sample), the Bader charge of Co is 1.14 e. When normalizing to C H N OBCo, the nominal oxidation state of 2.16 is obtained for HO–Co /PCN, confirming the more positive oxidation state of Co under open-circuit conditions. The Cartesian coordinates of the relaxed models are provided in Supplementary Data –."

The in situ XANES results are shown in. The existence of N x H y species on the surface of Ru/TiO under the reaction conditions is shown by the presence of absorptions (centred at 398.1 and 401.0 eV) arising from transitions from the K shell (N 1 s ) to the unoccupied π * orbital, and absorptions (centred at 405.5 and 413.0 eV) from transitions into the σ * orbital. The intensities of the absorption peaks centred at 401.0, 405.5 and 413.0 eV decrease with temperature, which is presumably associated with the desorption of molecular N at increased temperature. By contrast, the absorption peak at 398.1 eV, which can be ascribed to the =N– group in the N H x species, exhibits an intensity enhancement with temperature. This indicates a dominance of an asymmetric species such as N H, which is in good agreement with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations reported below, which showed that it is kinetically more favourable for N H to form on the Ru/TiO surface than a symmetric species such as N H. The in situ FTIR results are shown in –f. In the presence of N and H on Ru/TiO,d ), the IR bands at 3,375 and 3,478 cm −1 could be assigned to the ν(N–H) stretching vibrations of N x H y species, and the primary IR band at 1,623 cm −1 could be tentatively attributed to the ν(N=N) stretching of N H x species, whereas no IR band was observed at atmosphere pressure (Supplementary ). Moreover, the intensity of the ν(N=N) IR band at 1,623 cm −1 increased gradually with elevated temperature, which is consistent with the results from in situ nitrogen XANES measurements. It is generally accepted that the O−H deformation vibration of surface hydroxy groups is located at 1,630 to 1,660 cm −1. To exclude the possibility that the IR band at 1,623 cm −1 originates from the vibration of O−H, a set of experiments were executed, including introducing only H (Supplementary ) into the reaction system, H"

Here, we demonstrate that platinum single atoms on carbon carriers are substantially more stable (up to 1,073 K) than their gold counterparts (up to 473 K), enabling facile and scalable preparation and precise tuning of their coordination environment by simple temperature control. By combining kinetic analysis, advanced characterization, and density functional theory, we assess how the Pt species determines the catalytic performance and thereby identify Pt( ii )−Cl as the active site, being three times more active than Pt nanoparticles. We show that Pt single atoms exhibit outstanding stability in acetylene hydrochlorination and surpass the space–time yields of their gold-based analogues after 25 h time-on-stream, qualifying them as a candidate for sustainable vinyl chloride production.

A site in our model is defined as a coordinatively unsaturated Lewis-acidic metal atom and a bridging oxygen atom. Three types of sites exist: Ti cus O br /TiO, Pt–O /TiO and Pt–O /TiO. This approach allows us to model the different local environments of oxygen, which possess different thermodynamic and kinetic properties based on the presence and coordination of Pt.

In brief, 25 g of NaOH (reagent grade ≥98%) was dissolved in 30 ml of demineralized water. A solution of 2.17 g of Ce(NO )∙6H O (99% purity) in 5 ml of demineralized water was prepared. Subsequently, the two solutions were poured together, and the obtained slurry was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Next, the volume was increased to ~100 ml by adding demineralized water and the slurry was transferred into a 125 ml Teflon liner. This liner was then sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave, which was placed in an oven for 24 h at 100°C. After cooling in a water bath, the obtained precipitate was washed with five cycles of centrifugation, decantation and redispersion until a pH of ~7–8 was obtained. The resulting solid was dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 80°C and then calcined in air at 500°C. Subsequently, a Pd wet impregnation of CeO nanorods using Pd(NO )∙2H O as the Pd precursor was performed. An appropriate amount of Pd salt was dissolved in demineralized water (10 ml) and poured onto the calcined CeO powder. The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min at room temperature and then slowly heated to evaporate the water without boiling. The obtained solid was dried overnight at 110°C and subsequently calcined in air at 300°C. The calcined samples were denoted as 1PdRods and 5PdRods, depending on the intended Pd loading. The FSP synthesis was performed using a commercial TETHIS NPS10 apparatus. The principal scheme of the synthesis set-up can be found in Supplementary. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Ce(acac)∙H O (99.9% purity) and Pd(acac) ∙H O (99% purity) salts (acac, acetylacetone) in glacial acetic acid (99.7% purity), which gave rise to a 0.1 M Ce precursor solution, and the Pd molarity was varied to target a particular Pd loading. To increase the solubility of the salts, the solution was heated slightly to ~50°C and stirred for 0.5 h. The fully transparent solution was then transferred into the syringe of the FSP set-up. The solution was injected at a feed rate of 5 ml min −1 into the methane/oxygen flame (1.5 l min −1 of methane and 3.0 l min −1 of oxygen). An oxygen flow of 5.0 l min −1 was used for the dispersion of the solution, which gave rise to an overpressure at the nozzle of ~2.5 bar. On pyrolysis in the flame, the NPs were formed and deposited on the quartz fibre filter in the upper part of the set-up (Supplementary ). The powders collected from the filter were denoted as 1PdFSP and 5PdFSP, depending on the intended Pd loading."

To prepare engineered CeO, tetraamineplatinum nitrate solution was impregnated onto CeO powder by conventional wet impregnation, followed by drying at 120°C for 12 h. The powder was then calcined at 800°C for 10 h in flowing air. The obtained materials were denoted as 1Pt@CeO and 3Pt@CeO, corresponding to the Pt loadings of 1 and 3 wt.%, respectively. The high temperature treatment causes a drop in BET surface area, from 135 m g −1 for the as-received ceria to 60 m g −1 for the pure ceria (PS ceria), 78 m g −1 for 1Pt@CeO and 100 m g −1 for the 3Pt@CeO sample.

The benchmark catalysts, based on Pd, still face challenges such as water poisoning and long-term stability. Here we report an approach for catalyst synthesis that relies on the trapping of metal single atoms on the support surface, in thermally stable form, to modify the nature of further deposited metal/metal oxide. By anchoring Pt ions on a catalyst support we can tailor the morphology of the deposited phase. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) rafts of PdO x are formed, resulting in higher reaction rates and improved water tolerance during methane oxidation. The results show that modifying the support by trapping single atoms could provide an important addition to the toolkit of catalyst designers for controlling the nucleation and growth of metal and metal oxide clusters in heterogeneous catalysts.

Moreover, WT analysis results of Aza-CMP-Co and Aza-CMP-Co (posted) exhibit similar intensity maxima at 3.90 and 3.87 Å −1, respectively, suggesting that Aza-CMP-Co exists as mononuclear metal centres after OER ). Notably, the redox features and catalytic current density of Aza-CMP-Co are preserved after 400 CV scans in various electrolytes, revealing good stability of single-site cobalt toward OER under broad pH conditions (Supplementary ). For Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated), aggregation of the cobalt component was observed in EDX elemental mapping images –l and Supplementary ). shows numerous cobalt sites present in the selected area after catalysis. However, nano-oxide clusters and crystalline oxide slices were also generated during OER,o ). Compared with the XPS spectra of Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) before and after catalysis, the shifted Co 2p peak at 779.7 eV and the new O 1s peak at 529.8 eV confirm the presence of cobalt oxide species,q ). The FT–IR features of the used Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) correspond to those of Aza-CMP-Co rather than those of pristine Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) in the sections marked 1, 2 and 3, implying a decrease in coordinated cobalt sites after catalysis ). In summary, the dynamic evolution of the cobalt composition in Aza-CMP varied with metal site loading: with a relatively low metal loading, Aza-CMP-Co showed excellent structural stability while the increase in cobalt site loading to approximately 20 wt% (most SACs have a low metal content of <1 wt% ( )) resulted in distinct decomposition of cobalt sites owing to the high concentration of molecular cobalt in the confined local area. Additionally, the formation of oxide phases explains the lower TOFs of Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) compared with those of Aza-CMP-Co and the asymmetric redox peak in Supplementary."

In brief, 0.95 mM Zn(NO ) ·6H O and 0.05 mM FeSO ·7H O as metal sources, and 8.21 g of 2-methylimidazole as the organic linker, were mixed with methanol to form Fe-doped ZIF-8. The excess organic linker and metal sources were removed by washing the product three times with absolute ethanol. After drying in a vacuum oven at 80°C overnight, Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursor was directly heat-treated in Ar gas (99.99% purity) at 1,000°C for 1 h to derive the final Fe–N–C catalyst. Atomically dispersed Fe atoms were uniformly distributed on the N–C framework without further acid washes. The weight of Fe loading in the final catalyst was around 2.0 wt%. According to our previous work, impregnation of Fe–N–C with an ultralow Pt loading could significantly promote the durability of Fe–N–C, but it did not present a noticeable activity improvement, especially in the kinetic region. In this follow-up work, ammonia heat treatment was designed to expose more active sites and tailor the properties of the carbon support and the coordination number of single atoms. Secondary Ar pyrolysis after ammonia treatment is designed to stabilize the carbon framework. Thus, Fe-doped ZIF-8 was used as the support for Pt impregnation in this work to simplify heat treatment protocols. Pt(II) acetylacetonate (10 mg) was homogeneously dispersed in 3 ml of ethanol via ultrasonication until the solvent became transparent. In the meantime, 110 mg of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol was added to the Pt solution to provide a sufficient nitrogen source for Pt coordination. Around 400 mg of Fe-doped ZIF-8 was added to the above solution to form a uniform suspension. After drying at 60°C in a vacuum oven overnight, the solid was collected and ball milled (ZrO ball, 350 revolutions per minute (r.p.m.), 4 h) to uniformly distribute Pt and N sources on the Fe-doped ZIF-8 support. The mixed precursors were first treated in NH gas at 900°C for 15 min and then transferred to an Ar atmosphere at 1,000°C for 1 h to remove Zn in the precursor and stabilize the whole carbon framework to produce the final catalyst, Pt-Fe-N-C. The Pt and Fe loadings were around 1.7 and 2.0 wt%, respectively. As a reference electrocatalyst, Pt–N–C was prepared from a ZIF-8 support, which was formed by mixing 1 mM Zn(NO ) ·6H O and 8.21 g of 2-methylimidazole in a methanol solvent and following the same collecting and drying protocols as for Fe-doped ZIF-8. Similarly, 10 mg of platinum(II) acetylacetonate was homogeneously dispersed in 3 ml of ethanol via ultrasonication until the solvent became transparent. In the meantime, 110 mg of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol was added to the Pt solution to provide a sufficient nitrogen source for Pt coordination. Around 400 mg of ZIF-8 was added to this solution to form a uniform suspension. After drying at 60°C in a vacuum oven overnight, the solid was collected and ball milled (ZrO ball, 350 r.p.m., 4 h) to uniformly distribute the Pt and N sources on the ZIF-8 support. The mixed precursors were also initially treated in NH gas at 900°C for 15 min and then transferred into an Ar atmosphere at 1,000°C for 1 h. The final catalyst, Pt–N–C, had a Pt loading of 2.3 wt%."

The Debye–Waller factor scales to the width of the bond length distribution of the X-ray absorber–scatterer pairs ). Hence, when the temperature of a material rises, the level of structural disorder goes up, leading to a broader bond length distribution and an increased Debye–Waller factor, thus damping the EXAFS signal. More quantitatively, at higher temperatures, the Debye and Einstein models describe that σ ( T ) follows a quasi-linear relation with the temperature T )."

All reagents for the synthetic part of the work were purchased from commercial suppliers and used directly without any further purification. Ni −nCN was prepared through a modified published SA x procedure.1–3 In brief, graphitic carbon nitride (gCN ) was first prepared using dicyanamide as a source of carbon x and nitrogen. In a typical experiment, dicyanamide (10 g) was placed in an alumina crucible and heated in air at 550°C for 3 h, at a heating rate of 10°C min−1. To prepare the nanosheets, gCN (750 mg) was thinly spread out x in the alumina combustion boat, making good contact with air, and then heated at 520°C for 4.5 h, using a heating rate of 2°C min−1.

It is obviously shown that Ni S phases were always detected in the situation of relative 3 2 low N-doping content below 20 at%. These experimental results together with the theoretical investigations evidenced that constructing N-doped carbons with very high N contents should been critically important for triggerring the metal sulfide particles into highly loaded Ni–N coordinated single atoms, matching well with the discussions in the Introduction section. Supplementary XRD patterns analyzing the intermediate species variation during the pyrolysis in 600, 700 and 800 oC for the samples with 25 % addition of melamine relative to that of UHDNi–N–C SACs. Generally, although the peak strength of NiS intermediate decreased to some extent as the temperature increased (Supplementary, suggesting the decomposition of partial NiS particles, there was a lack of sufficient N dopants to stabilize the Ni atoms and they thus reaggregated into Ni S particles. These experimental results suggest that competing 3 2 atomization and sintering processes occur when the N-doping content in the carbon support is low. In the situation where the N-doping content is not enough, the competing metal sintering reaction dominates the atom migration pathway, distinct from the case in the"

Pollutant degradation for wastewater treatment The model pollutant solution or wastewater was first prepared, and a certain amount of Fe–N–C was added. If necessary, the pH of the reaction solution was adjusted to the target value using NaOH or HCl. The mixture was stirred well to evenly distribute the components, and PMS was then added. At the required time, the sample was removed from the reaction solution, filtered and detected in a timely manner. Long-term degradation experiment The catalyst (20 mg) was introduced before the start of the reaction. To 100 ml of the reaction solution, 20 mg l −1 of phenol and 20 mg of PMS were added during each reaction cycle, and the phenol concentration in the reaction solution was measured at the end of each cycle. Three long-term degradation cycles were conducted daily. When the catalyst became deactivated, it was washed with ethanol and reused for pollutant degradation. Measurement of CODs for catalyst and reaction solution For measuring the COD of the solution, 3 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and filtered, and 2 ml of the filtrate was used as the sample. For measuring the COD of catalyst, 50 ml of the reaction mixture was membrane filtered, and the powder was collected and ultrasonically redispersed in an equal volume of pure water. Subsequently, 2 ml of the dispersion was used as the sample for measuring the COD. Data availability The data that support the conclusions of this study are available within the manuscript and Supplementary information."

A CeO slab model (11.5 Å × 13.3 Å) with three triatomic layers was adopted to investigate the evolution of interfacial structures from that incorporating isolated single Pt O x species to Pt n clusters. The total energy calculations were performed using a 2 × 2 × 1 grid and a plane-wave cut-off energy of 400 eV. A vacuum space greater than 15 Å was added in the z direction to avoid interaction with each slab. Atoms in the bottom triatomic layer of a catalyst model were fixed, and all the other atoms, including adsorbates, were allowed to relax until the force on each ion was less than 0.02 eV Å –1.
