                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_nature21672_synthesis, Methods Preparation of catalysts α-MoC support . Ammonium paramolybdate ((NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 •4H 2 O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. A grinded powder of ammonium paramolybdate was calcined in a muffle oven to 500°C at a rate of 10°C min −1 to synthesize the precursor MoO 3 . Then 0.8 g MoO 3 was loaded into a quartz tube reactor and placed in a vertical furnace. The powder was heated to 700°C in NH 3 (100 ml min −1 ; pre-purified gas) at a rate of 5°C min −1 and kept at 700°C for 2 hours. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the gas was then switched to a CH 4 /H 2 mixture (100 ml min −1 ; 20/80 v/v), and the temperature was increased to 700°C at 5°C min −1 and held at 700°C for 2 hours. Finally, the sample was passivated at room temperature using a 0.5% O 2 /He gas mixture 29 . Elemental analysis finds that the Mo/C ratio of α-MoC is around 1/0.8. β-Mo 2 C support . β-Mo 2 C was synthesized using the same precursor as α-MoC, as follows: 0.8 g MoO 3 was loaded in the quartz tube and carburized with a CH 4 /H 2 mixture (100 ml min −1 ; 20/80 v/v), with the temperature being increased at 5°C min −1 to 300°C, then at 1°C min −1 to 700°C. After carburization at 700°C for 2 hours, the sample was cooled to room temperature and passivated using a 0.5% O 2 /He gas mixture. 2%Pt/β-Mo 2 C catalyst . The passivated β-Mo 2 C support was transferred to a deaerated, aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 •6H 2 O) to achieve the desired loading. The slurry was stirred for 3 hours, dried using evaporation, and then transferred to a freeze dryer overnight to remove any moisture. Before catalytic evaluation, the catalyst was activated with a CH 4 /H 2 mixture (15/85 v/v). The activation temperature program heated the sample to 300°C and held it there for 1 hour. The temperature was then increased to 590°C at a rate of 5°C min −1 and held there for another 2 hours. 2%Pt/α-MoC and 2%Pt/MoC-2 catalysts . An appropriate amount of H 2 PtCl 6 •6H 2 O was loaded onto a homemade MoO 3 support, using a wetness impregnation method. (To synthesize MoO 3 , an appropriate amount of ammonium paramolybdate was dissolved into pure water, adjusting the pH of the solution to 3.7. The solution underwent ultrasonication for 2 hours. The precipitates thus generated were separated by evaporation of solvent and dried at 60°C under a vacuum overnight. The precipitates were then grinded into powder and calcined in air at 500°C for 4 hours.) After being dried at room temperature under vacuum, the sample was calcined at 500°C for 4 hours. For Pt/α-MoC, the calcined Pt/MoO 3 was carburized using the same procedure as for the synthesis of β-Mo 2 C. For Pt/MoC-2, MoO 3 impregnated with H 2 PtCl 6 was carburized directly without calcination in air at 500°C. 2%Pt/MoC-3 catalysts . An appropriate amount of H 2 PtCl 6 •6H 2 O aqueous solution was added into the ammonium paramolybdate solution dropwise under stirring. A yellow precipitant was thus generated. The solvent was evaporated at 90°C and the precipitant was dried at 120°C for 3 hours to ensure that the powder was dried 30 . Then the sample was carburized (as for β-Mo 2 C) directly to obtain 2%Pt/MoC-3. 2%Pt/Al 2 O 3 and 2%Pt/TiO 2 . These reference catalysts were synthesized using wet impregnation of H 2 PtCl 6 •6H 2 O over commercial Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 supports 12 . The slurry was stirred for 3 hours in air to remove the liquid, using the rotary evaporator under vacuum at 35°C. The material was dried at 120°C for 3 hours, and then calcined in the muffle oven at 500°C. The Pt loading is 2%. The catalysts were reduced with H 2 before catalytic evaluation. Pt/α-MoC catalysts with different Pt loadings . Pt/α-MoC catalysts with 2.2 wt%, 3.1 wt%, 5.1 wt% and 7.4 wt% Pt loadings were prepared as for Pt/α-MoC. Samples with 0.2 wt% and 0.7 wt% Pt loading were prepared using the wetness impregnation method with activated α-MoC as the support. The catalysts are denoted x %Pt/α-MoC, where x denotes the rough weight concentration of Pt ( x = 0.2, 1, 2, 3, 5 or 7)."

All other chemicals, including Au(OH) 3, HAuCl 4, NaOH pellets, and (NH 4)2CO 3, were supplied by Alfar Aesar. The Au/TiO 2 sample made by deposition precipitation (DP) was used as reference. Typically, 150 mL of HAuCl 4 aqueous solution was added into a 250 mL water suspension of 5 g titania. After stirring the slurry for 1 h, 1 mol/L of (NH 4)2CO 3 solution was slowly added to keep the pH around 8. The slurry was heated to 70 oC and aged for 1 h. The fresh samples were obtained by filtering the slurry, continuously washing with 70 oC water, then drying in vacuum at room temperature (RT) overnight. The obtained powder catalysts were calcined at 200 oC for 2 h (ramping rate: 2 oC/min) to obtain the 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO 2 (DP) sample.

We mixed a Ir(acac) 3 /Zn(NO 3 ) 2 methanol solution with a 2-methylimidazole methanol solution to in situ-encapsulate Ir(acac) 3 within ZIF-8 during ZIF-8 crystallization. Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra of Ir(acac) 3 and Ir(acac) 3 @ZIF-8 showed consistent bands in the 290–325 nm and 415–450 nm ranges, which suggests that Ir(acac) 3 was encapsulated within ZIF-8 (Supplementary ). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments revealed rhombododecahedron-shaped Ir(acac) 3 @ZIF-8 nanocrystals (Supplementary ). The X-ray-diffraction pattern of Ir(acac) 3 @ZIF-8 was well matched with that of ZIF-8 (Supplementary ), indicating that Ir(acac) 3 did not disturb ZIF crystallization. : Synthesis and structural"

The Ga 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 , Ga 2 O 3 –Ir/Al 2 O 3 and Ga 2 O 3 –Ir–K/Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. Using Ga 2 O 3 –Ir–K/Al 2 O 3 as an example, Ga(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O, IrCl 3 ·3H 2 O and KNO 3 were used as precursors and dissolved in deionized water. A γ-Al 2 O 3 support was impregnated with this solution at room temperature for 12 h, followed by drying at 100°C overnight and calcination at 600°C for 4 h. The Ga, Ir and K loadings were ∼ 3, ∼ 0.05 and ∼ 0.25 wt%, respectively. A commercial CrO x –K/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was synthesized according to the Fridman method 52 . Briefly, the desired amounts of CrO 3 and KOH were separately dissolved in water. Then, the two solutions were mixed. Afterwards, γ-Al 2 O 3 was added to the mixture. The catalyst was collected after drying and calcination at 760°C for 4 h. The Cr and K loadings were ∼ 19.8 and ∼ 0.98 wt%, respectively. The loadings of M (M = Ga, Cr) were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), based on the weight ratio of M to Al 2 O 3 . Catalytic testing The catalysts were tested in a quartz fixed-bed reactor (8 mm inner diameter and 24 cm length) under atmospheric pressure. A mixture (1 ml) of 30–200 mg catalyst and quartz sand (20–40 mesh size) was loaded into the tubular quartz reactor. The catalysts were first heated to 600°C at a rate of 10°C min −1 in N 2 (50 ml min −1 ). Afterwards, a mixture of C 3 H 8 , H 2 and N 2 was fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 50 ml min −1 . The inlet concentrations of C 3 H 8 and/or H 2 were varied from 0 to 40 vol% by changing the flow rate of C 3 H 8 , H 2 and N 2 while keeping the total flow rate constant. For the pre-reduction, after heating to 600°C, the catalysts were treated in 42 vol% H 2 /N 2 (50 ml min −1 ) for 1 h and then purged in N 2 (50 ml min −1 ) for another 1 h. The gas products were analysed in an online gas chromatograph (GC-2060, Shanghai Ruimin Instrument Co. Ltd.) equipped with a flame ionization detector (Al 2 O 3 plot column) and a thermal conductivity detector (TDX-01 column). The conversion of C 3 H 8 ( X (C 3 H 8 )), selectivity for C 3 H 6 , CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 4 ( S ( i )) and coke ( S (coke)), and C 3 H 6 formation rate ( r (C 3 H 6 )) were calculated using equations ( 1 )–( 4 ), respectively: $$X\\left({\\text{C}}_{3}{\\text{H}}_{8}\\right)=\\frac{F_i^{\\;\\text{in}}-F_i^{\\;\\text{out}}}{F_i^{\\;\\text{in}}}$$ $$S\\left(i\\right)=\\frac{n_i}{n_{{\\text{C}}_{3}{\\text{H}}_{8}}}\\frac{F_i^{\\;\\text{out}}}{F_{{\\text{C}}_{3}{\\text{H}}_{8}}^{\\;\\text{in}}-F_{{\\text{C}}_{3}{\\text{H}}_{8}}^{\\;\\text{out}}}$$ $$S\\left(\\text{coke}\\right)=1-{\\sum }_iS(i)$$ $$r\\left({\\text{C}}_{3}{\\text{H}}_{6}\\right)=\\frac{F_{{\\text{C}}_{3}{\\text{H}}_{6}}^{\\;\\text{out}}}{m_{\\text{cat}}}$$ where \\({F}_{i}^{\\;{\\rm{in}}}\\) and \\({F}_{i}^{\\;{\\rm{out}}}\\) are the rates of flow of gas-phase components at the reactor inlet and outlet (mmol min −1 ), respectively, m cat is the mass of the catalyst, and \\(n_{\\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_8}\\) and n i are the numbers of carbon atoms in propane and the product i (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 4 and C 3 H 6 ), respectively. A first-order deactivation model was used to evaluate the catalyst stability: $${k}_{{\\rm{d}}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{1-{X}_{{\\rm{Final}}}}{{X}_{{\\rm{Final}}}}\\right)-\\,\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{1-{X}_{{\\rm{Initial}}}}{{X}_{{\\rm{Initial}}}}\\right)}{\\tau }$$ where X Initial and X Final are the conversions of C 3 H 8 measured in the initial and final stages of the reaction, respectively, τ is the reaction time (h) and k d is the deactivation rate constant (h −1 ). High k d values indicate rapid deactivation, that is, low stability."

Subsequently, the fine powder mixture underwent a two-stage pyrolysis and carbonization process (first stage: from 25 to 600°C at a ramping rate of 3°C min –1 , maintain at 600°C for 2 h; second stage: from 600 to 900°C at a ramping rate of 2°C min –1 , maintain at 900°C for 1 h) in a tubular furnace (Carbolite, UK) in argon atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was successively leached at 80°C in 1 M HCl for 12 h and 1 M HNO 3 for another 24 h to remove metal particles and unstable species. Afterwards, the sample was heated again at 850°C in Ar for 1 h to recover the crystallinity of carbon. Nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) was prepared by pyrolyzing a mixture of graphene oxide (100 mg) and melamine (500 mg) at 1,000°C for 2 h in a tube furnace under argon atmosphere. To prepare metallic Ni-nanoparticle-decorated nitrogen-doped graphene (Ni-NG), 100 mg of graphene oxide was first dispersed in 30 ml of deionized (DI) water by ultrasonication, followed by addition of 2.5 mg of nickel( ii ) acetate tetrahydrate. The mixture was kept stirred over a water bath at 80°C for 2 h, then freeze dried for 24 h to remove DI water. Subsequently, the dried product was ground with 500 mg of melamine into a homogeneous mixture, followed by a pyrolysis process at 900°C for 2 h in argon atmosphere. The Ni-NG was obtained by cooling to room temperature."

The reaction mixture was then heated to 70°C and kept for 3 h with magnetic stirring and argon protection. The black mixture was then partitioned between water (150 ml) and dichloromethane (DCM, 150 ml). The aqueous phase was separated and extracted with DCM (200 ml × 3). The solvents of the combined organic phase were removed under reduced pressure and the product was purified by flash chromatography with DCM as the eluent to give 4-methoxyphthalonitrile (2.7 g, 73% yield). 4-Methoxyphthalonitrile (2.7 g) and nickel acetate tetrahydrate (1.35 g) were then added to a Schlenk flask equipped with a stir bar, followed by adding 50 ml of sulfolane. After several cycles of vacuum and refilling with argon, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (0.6 ml) was added, followed by another three cycles of vacuum and refilling with argon.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( m / z ): 770.04838 (M + ). Analysis: C 40 H 8 N 16 Ni, 770.04768. Preparation of MPc MDEs NiPc and CoPc were obtained from Alfa Aesar. To prepare MPc MDEs, 30 mg CNTs (C-Nano, FT 9000) were dispersed in 20 ml DMF by high-power sonication for 1 h (Xinzhi SB-5200D, 360 W). A calculated amount of the original or substituted NiPc/CoPc was dissolved in 10 ml DMF with high-power sonication and added to the CNT suspension. The mixed suspension was sonicated for another 30 min and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. NiPc has low solubility in DMF, and thus the high-power sonication step is important for mixing. The MPc MDE materials were separated by centrifuge and washed with DMF, ethanol and water (Milli-Q water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm at 25°C was used throughout the experiments), followed by lyophilization to obtain the final products. Synthesis of P-NiNC The synthesis adopted a previous report with minor modifications 33 . Briefly, zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.9 g) and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (0.9 g) were dissolved in 120 ml methanol. The solution was then mixed with 2-methylimidazole (2.0 g dissolved in 40 ml methanol) and stirred at room temperature for 18 h. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 8,000 r.p.m. for 6 min to collect the precipitate, which was further washed with methanol three times and dried in a vacuum oven at 80°C overnight. The solid was subjected to heat treatment at 1,000°C (at a ramping rate of 5°C min −1 ) in a tube furnace for 3 h under 100 sccm argon flow.

                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41563-019-0349-9_synthesis, Catalyst Preparation Our analysis focuses on catalysts synthesized using strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) principles to deposit 0.025% wt. Pt on 5 nm diameter anatase TiO2 crystals, described previously.1 This loading corresponds to ~0.4 Pt atoms/TiO2 particle, ensuring that Pt cluster (or even dimer) formation is minimized. In a typical synthesis of 0.025 wt % Pt catalyst, 1 g of TiO2 was crushed, sieved to a powder finer than 75 µm, and dried in a vacuum oven at 120°C overnight prior to synthesis. Twenty-five milliliters of deionized water was mixed with 75 mL of NH4OH to suspend the TiO2 support, resulting in a solution pH of 12.2. Separately, 10 mg of TAPN was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water from which 300 µL were taken and added to 25 mL of NH4OH to create a precursor solution with a pH of 12.2. The 25 mL TAPN solution was injected over 12.5 hours into the support solution while constantly stirring to achieve a final total solution volume of 125 mL with a surface loading of 2900 m2/L. Following the slow precursor addition, the final solution was heated to 70°C until completely dried. The catalyst was calcined in a tube furnace at 450°C for 4 hours in flowing air after ramping up to temperature at a rate of 10°C/min. The high temperature and extended duration of the calcination ensured removal of all remaining amine or nitrate ligands from the TAPN precursor, which are completely decomposed under these conditions. To ensure consistency, results were verified across synthesis batches, and the same batch of catalyst exhibited consistent behavior over the course of months. ICP-OES ICP-OES measurements were performed to quantitatively determine the accuracy of the SEA model at predicting metal uptake. A series of Pt/TiO2 catalysts with a target weight loading of 0.75% were identically prepared and then pH adjusted. For each catalyst, 1.71 mg of TAPN (corresponding to a final concentration of 25 ppm) was added to 6 mL of water. Separately, 100 mg of anatase TiO2 was dispersed in approximately 24 mL of water with microliter additions of acid or base to achieve the targeted pH under continuous stirring. The precursor solutions and corresponding support solutions were separately and continuously stirred overnight. To compensate for buffering effects, just prior to mixing, the pH of each support solution was checked and adjusted as necessary (no pH adjustment was found necessary for the precursor solutions). After combining a precursor-support solution pair, the final solution was allowed to mix for 1 hour. The final solution was then vacuum filtered using a 0.45 µm mixed cellulose ester membrane filter (Grainger, 14A842), and the filtrate was collected for analysis of the Pt concentration using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The difference between the theoretical maximum Pt concentration, and the concentration of Pt collected in the filtrate must equal the amount of Pt taken up by the support. Thus, the concentration of the filtrate provides a direct means of measuring the Pt uptake. A 1000 ppm Pt standard (Sigma-Aldrich, 19078) was purchased and a calibration standard series of five Pt concentrations was prepared ranging from 0 to 200 ppm for ICP-OES spanning across the maximum Pt concentration of 25 ppm. For each of the filtrates, Pt concentrations were obtained at three Pt optical emission lines, 203.6, 214.4, and 265.9 nm and an average of the expected Pt concentration was measured. Catalyst"

Pt NPs were prepared by thermal decomposition of platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac) 2 , 99.98%) by colloidal synthesis using standard Schlenk techniques following a previously reported procedure 2 . First, 10 ml trioctylamine (95%), 0.66 ml 1-oleylamine (70%) and 2.5 ml oleic acid (90%) were added to 79 mg Pt(acac) 2 in a three-necked flask. The reaction content was degassed (<2 torr) for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 220 μl trioctylphosphine (97%) was added to the reaction mixture. The flask was further degassed at 120°C for 30 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 350°C at a rate of ~20°C min −1 and kept at this temperature for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction content was split into two centrifuge tubes, and each was washed with a mixture of 10 ml isopropyl alcohol and 20 ml ethanol and recovered by centrifugation (8,586 g , 3 min). Finally, the NPs were suspended in hexanes. Pd NPs were synthesized using 77 mg Pd(acac) 2 , 4.5 ml of 1-octadecene (ODE), 5.5 ml tetradecene, 1.66 ml 1-oleylamine and 0.567 ml trioctylphosphine. The reaction content was degassed at 50°C for 30 min, heated to 225°C under nitrogen at a rate of ~20°C min −1 and kept at this temperature for 30 min. For the Pd–Pt NP synthesis, 3.3 ml 1-oleylamine, 1.6 ml oleic acid and 40 ml 1-octadecene were added to 200.7 mg Pt(acac) 2 and 157 mg Pd(acac) 2 in a three-necked flask. The reaction content was degassed for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 550 μl trioctylphosphine was added to the reaction mixture. The flask was further degassed at 50°C for 30 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 300°C at a rate of ~20°C min −1 and kept at this temperature for 15 min. The NPs were washed following the procedure described above. Synthesis of Pt@POF The POF was prepared using standard air-free Schlenk techniques following a previously reported procedure 19 . First, 9.3 g melamine (99%, Acros Organics) and 15 g terephthalaldehyde (99%, Acros Organics) were added to 495 ml dimethylsulfoxide (99.9%, Fisher) in a three-necked flask. The content was degassed at room temperature for 15 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 180°C at a rate of ~20°C min −1 and kept at this temperature for 72 h. The solid product was washed with acetone three times and dried under vacuum (~150 torr) at 80°C for 24 h to give a yield of 64%. Then, 8 mg Pt NPs in hexanes was added dropwise to 400 mg POF dispersed in 10 ml of a 1:9 mixture of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and hexanes under vigorous stirring. The mixture was stirred for 20 min to allow the NPs to adsorb onto the support. The observation of colourless supernatants indicated the complete adsorption of the NPs. The solvents were then removed by centrifugation (8,586 g , 3 min) and the powder was dried at 80°C for 3 h. Organic ligands were removed by calcination in air at 300°C for 20 min. The NPs were then encapsulated by growing an additional POF layer around the preformed Pt/POF material: 0.75 g Pt/POF was added to 1.18 g melamine and 1.87 g terephthalaldehyde dissolved in 61 ml dimethylsulfoxide. The mixture was heated to 180°C as above, but for 24 h. The final material was washed three times with acetone as described above to obtain Pt@POF in a yield of 64%. Synthesis of Pt@Al 2 O 3 First, 18 g Al(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O (>98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100 ml ethanol. Next, 1.2 g Pt@POF was added to the solution. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min, then ethanol was slowly removed in a rotary evaporator at 60°C (water bath temperature) at 900 mbar for 1 h and then at 150 mbar for 1 h. The material was then dried under vacuum (~150 torr) at 80°C for 24 h. The final product was obtained by calcining the sample at 600°C for 5 h at a ramp rate of 0.5°C min −1 . This procedure resulted in purely mesoporous Al 2 O 3 . For the synthesis of a mix of micro- and mesoporous Al 2 O 3 , an ammonia solution in ethanol (24 ml ethanol mixed with 18 ml ammonia solution (2 M in ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich)) was added to the sample; ethanol was removed in the rotary evaporator, before removing the ammonia solution, again following the procedure described above. Synthesis of supported Pt and Pd–Pt The appropriate amount of Pt or Pd–Pt NPs was added to the alumina support dispersed in hexanes under vigorous stirring to achieve a nominal metal loading of 0.5 wt%. The mixtures were stirred for 20 min to allow the NPs to adsorb onto the support, and the catalysts were recovered by centrifugation (8,586 g , 3 min). The observation of colourless supernatants indicated the complete adsorption of the NPs for each solution. The powders were then dried at 80°C for 3 h and sieved below a grain size of 180 µm. Organic ligands were removed by fast calcination of the catalysts at 700°C for 30 s ( ). Catalyst characterization Bright-field TEM was performed on a FEI Tecnai microscope operating at 200 kV. HAADF-STEM images were acquired using a FEI/Thermo Fisher TitanX device operating at 300 kV at the National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) facility of the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. To prepare powder samples for imaging, catalyst powder was shaken with lacey C/Cu grids. STEM tomography was performed at 300 kV using a FEI/Thermo Fisher TitanX device at NCEM with a 7 mrad convergence semi-angle and a beam current of ~3 pA. Images were acquired at tilt angles from −70° to +68° in steps of 2°. The tilt angle series was aligned using tomviz 1.9.0 ( www.tomviz.org ). The reconstruction was accomplished using the SART algorithm implemented in the Astra toolbox (version 1.9.0dev11) with 350 iterations. Visualization of the tomogram was accomplished using tomviz 1.9.0. STEM-EEL spectral data were collected at the Molecular Foundry on a TEAM I instrument, which is a double-corrected transmission electron microscope on the Thermo Fisher Titan platform with a Gatan Continuum GIF. Electron energy loss (EEL) spectra were recorded on a post-GIF K3 detector in electron counting mode with a dispersion of 0.18 eV per pixel. Sample thickness maps were acquired with 300 keV electrons with a 17.1 mrad convergence semi-angle and a 65 mrad collection semi-angle. Spectrum images were acquired using an 80 pA probe current, a 50 ms dwell time and 2 nm pixels with 16 × 16 sub-scanning of each STEM pixel. Sample thickness was estimated from the low-loss portion of the EEL spectrum image using the log-ratio method 32 . N 2 physisorption experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics 3Flex instrument. Powders were degassed under vacuum at 90°C for 1 h and then at 300°C for 5 h prior to N 2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. The micropore volume was calculated using non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) Advanced pore size distribution (PSD) using the slit geometry and carbon model. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a TA Instruments TGA-500 device. Pt NPs in hexanes were heated at a ramp rate of 10°C min −1 under a flow of air of 45 ml min −1 . Powder catalysts were pretreated at 300°C in air and then heated to 800°C at a ramp rate of 10°C min −1 . XPS measurements were carried out in a PHI VersaProbe I and III scanning XPS microprobe equipped with a hemispherical electron analyser with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1,486.6 eV) and an argon ion sputter gun. All samples were deposited on conductive carbon tabs on an aluminium holder, outgassed at 10 −4 mbar, and then transferred to the ion-pumped analysis chamber. The pressure was kept below ~5 × 10 −7 Pa during data acquisition. The incident X-ray spot size was 100 µm, and an excitation of 100 W at 20 kV was used for the radiation source. The binding energies were referenced to the C 1 s peak (284.8 eV) to account for charging effects. Given the Al Kα radiation energy (1,486.6 eV) of the XPS source and a Pt 4 d binding energy of 315 eV, Pt 4 d photoelectrons were emitted with a kinetic energy of 1,171.6 eV. This corresponds to an escape depth of ~1–2 nm ( ). XRF fluorescence measurements were collected on a XEPOS X-ray spectrometer. The spectrometer was equipped with a solid-state detector and samples were analysed at four different energies. PXRD samples were ground to fine powders, placed on amorphous silicon wafers and pressed down into the holders with a thin film of silicon grease. The samples were then placed on a Miniflex 600 diffractometer with Bragg–Brentano geometry equipped with a one-dimensional solid-state detector. Samples were scanned for 1.5 h to achieve the desired signal-to-noise ratio. All NMR data were collected with a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer (14.1 T field, 156.25 MHz for 27 Al) using a Varian ‘T3’ probe with a 3.2 mm zirconia rotor spinning at 20 kHz. The background signal from the rotor was negligible. Spectra are referenced to 0.1 M aqueous Al(NO 3 ) 3 at 0 ppm. The radiofrequency power was ~100 kHz; single pulse acquisition was used with 0.2 μs pulses, corresponding to a radiofrequency tip angle of ~20° for solids with quadrupolar coupling. Relaxation delays of 1 s between pulses allowed averaging of typically 40,000 acquisitions, yielding very high signal-to-noise ratios. Data collected with delays of 10 and 60 s showed no or only minor increases in intensity. Differential relaxation among signals for different Al sites was generally negligible, except in several samples that seemed to contain large proportions of both the AlO 5 -rich amorphous phase and the AlO 5 -poor crystalline transition alumina, which relaxed slightly more slowly. The relative proportions of four-, five- and six-coordinated Al (AlO 4 , AlO 5 and AlO 6 ) were estimated by the fitting of ±1/2 to ±3/2 spinning sidebands, which are less affected by second-order quadrupolar broadening than central transition resonances. XAS spectra of the platinum catalysts were recorded at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) at wiggler beamline 9-3 using a liquid nitrogen-cooled Si double-crystal monochromator with harmonic rejection and focusing optics. The storage ring was operated at 3 GeV with a ring current of 494–500 mA in top-off mode. A beam cross-section of 1 mm × 4 mm was used. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and EXAFS spectra were recorded at the Pt L 3 -edge (11,564 eV) and Pd K-edge (24,350 eV) in fluorescence mode using a passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) diode. The transmission spectra of Pt and Pd reference foils were collected simultaneously for internal energy calibration using nitrogen- or argon-filled ion chambers. Samples typically consisted of 60 mg catalyst pressed into a 7-mm-diameter pellet and mounted at 45° to the incident beam. The sample mass was specifically calculated to minimize self-absorption during the fluorescence measurement. Ex situ EXAFS spectra were acquired at room temperature. The XAS spectra were energy-calibrated, merged and normalized, and the resulting EXAFS spectra were extracted using the Athena interface of the Demeter software package 36 . EXAFS modelling was performed using the Artemis interface of the Demeter software 36 . S 0 2 was determined to be 0.79 ± 0.06 for the Pt L 3 -edge from fitting the Pt foil. Models were fitted in R space using k 1 , k 2 and k 3 weightings. For the Pt catalyst samples, the EXAFS spectra were modelled with an R range of 1.9–4.9 Å and a k range of 3.6–14.3 Å −1 . The Pt–Pt scattering path was simulated using FEFF in Artemis based on a Pt foil cif input file (ICSD code 243678). The EXAFS data from all catalysts were modelled simultaneously to minimize errors. The fitting was conducted using symmetric expansion parameter α . The average size of Pt from the fitted EXAFS data was calculated using the Pt–Pt coordination numbers from the first scattering path and fitting parameters determined in previously published work 22 . The XAS spectra of the Pd–Pt catalysts were collected during a separate beam time shift at 9-3. The EXAFS data of the Pd–Pt catalysts were modelled using S 0 2 values of 0.78 and 0.81 for the Pt L 3 -edge and Pd K-edge, respectively, with R ranges of 1.2–3.0 Å (Pd) and 1.7–3.2 Å (Pt), and k ranges of 2.7–12.5 Å −1 (Pd) and 3.1–12.0 Å −1 (Pt). The Pd–O, Pd–Pd, Pd–Pt, Pt–Pd and Pt–Pt scattering paths were simulated using FEFF in Artemis based on the following cif input files: Pt foil (ICSD code 243678), Pd foil (ICSD code 77885) and PdO (ICSD code 24692). Pd–Pt alloys were prepared by substituting Pt for Pd in the bulk Pd structure for Pd–Pt coordination, and Pd for Pt in the bulk Pt structure for Pt–Pd coordination. For each catalyst, the EXAFS data from the two edges were modelled simultaneously to minimize errors. DRIFTS measurements were performed using a Thermo Fisher Nicolet iS50 FT infrared spectrometer with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector. Powder samples were loaded into a Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFTS reaction cell. Measurements were carried out at room temperature, and 64 spectra were averaged for each spectrum to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Before the measurements, catalysts were pretreated for 30 min under O 2 (20 vol.%)/He at 300°C (ramp rate of 10°C min −1 ), for 10 min under He and for 30min under H 2 (5 vol.%)/He."

Carbon black (0.4 g; Cabot, BP2000) was then added and dispersed by stirring for 18 h under room temperature to ensure uniform distribution. Next, the mixture was dried by using a rotary evaporator and the remaining powder was collected. The powder was annealed in a flowing Ar/H 2 (5% H 2 ) atmosphere at 900°C for 2 h and then annealed in air at 250–550°C (450°C as the optimized temperature) for 3 h. After annealing, 50 mg of product was added to 20 ml of 1 M HCl and mixed at room temperature for 12 h to perform acid leaching, then centrifuged and washed with deionized water three times. Finally, the sample was dried at 80°C in an oven for 12 h to obtain the Ni-RuO 2 catalyst. Ru a Ni b O x -AL samples with different amounts of Ni dopant were also prepared following the same procedure, except that the level of precursors was tuned in the first step. In addition, RuO 2 with no Ni incorporated was prepared in a similar method using RuCl 3 as precursor. M-RuO 2 (M=Fe, Co, Zn, Cu) samples with different metal dopants were also prepared using the same procedure, except that the precursors used in the first step were different—FeCl 3 , CoCl 2 , Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O, and CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O. Of note, the weight ratio of total metal content in precursors to carbon black support was fixed at 1:4 in all catalyst synthesis."

Typically, Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (12.75 g) and 2-methylimidazole (29.15 g) were dissolved separately in deionized water (1,000 ml). Then the two aqueous solutions were rapidly mixed and vigorously stirred for 2 h. The resulting white precipitate was left undisturbed for 12 h. The product was collected by centrifugation, then washed with water and ethanol, and subsequently dried at 80°C overnight. To prepare NC, the 2D-ZIF-8 (5 g) was mixed with KCl (100 g) in deionized water (400 ml) and then dried under rotary evaporation. After drying (120°C overnight), the KCl intercalated powder was heated to 700°C (heating rate, 2°C min −1 ) for 5 h in a nitrogen flow. The product was washed with hydrochloric acid (2 M), deionized water and ethanol, then dried at 80°C overnight. Synthesis of Ni 1 /NC To achieve 30 wt% metal feeding, NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O (174 mg) and NC (100 mg) were dispersed in 20 ml ethanol solution, sonicated for 10 min, and dried first by rotary evaporation and then in an oven at 80°C.

Synthesis of PCN Bulk PCN was prepared by calcining dicyandiamide at 550°C (heating rate, 2.3°C min −1 ) in a crucible for 3 h in static air. Exfoliated PCN was obtained via the thermal exfoliation at 500°C (heating rate, 5°C min −1 ) for 5 h in static air. Synthesis of Ni 1 /PCN To achieve 30 wt% metal feeding, NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O (174 mg) and PCN (100 mg) were dispersed in ethanol solution (20 ml) and sonicated for 10 min, followed by rotary evaporation to dry. The oven-dried powder (80°C) was subsequently heated to 450°C (heating rate, 5°C min −1 ) for 5 h in a nitrogen flow. Using a water–ethanol mixture, the obtained powder was washed thoroughly and then dried in an oven at 80°C. Finally, the powders were heated to 550°C (heating rate, of 2°C min −1 ) and kept for 5 h under the protection of a nitrogen flow. Synthesis of CeO 2 Ce(CH 3 COO) 3 · x H 2 O was heated in air at 350°C (heating rate, 5°C min −1 ) for 2 h, then the temperature was increased to 600°C (heating rate, 5°C min −1 ) for 5 h. Synthesis of Ni 1 /CeO 2 To achieve 10 wt% metal feeding, NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O (45.5 mg) and CeO 2 (100 mg) were dispersed in ethanol solution (20 ml) and sonicated for 10 min, followed by rotary evaporation to remove the solvent. The powders were dried in an oven at 80°C and then heated to 300°C (heating rate, 5°C min −1 ) in static air. The obtained powders were washed thoroughly using a water–ethanol mixture and dried in an oven at 80°C. Finally, the powders are heated to 550°C (heating rate, of 1°C min −1 ) and kept for 5 h under static air. Synthesis of Ni 1 Pd 1 /NC NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O (24 mg), PdCl 2 (20 mg) and NC (100 mg) were dispersed in 0.5 M HCl solution (20 ml), sonicated for 10 min and dried first by rotary evaporation and then in an oven at 80°C. For the low-temperature annealing, the powder was heated to 200°C (heating rate, 5°C min −1 ) for 5 h in a nitrogen flow. After thorough washing using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and water, the dried powder (80°C) was subjected to a high-temperature annealing at 500°C (heating rate, 2°C min −1 ) for 5 h in a nitrogen flow. Synthesis of Ni 1 Pd 1 Pt 1 /NC NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O (20 mg), PdCl 2 (14 mg), H 2 PtCl 2 .6H 2 O (42 mg) and NC (100 mg) were dispersed in 0.5 M HCl solution (20 ml), sonicated for 10 min, and dried by rotary evaporation and in an oven (80°C). For the low-temperature annealing, the powder was heated to 200°C (heating rate, 5°C min −1 ) for 5 h in a nitrogen flow. After thorough washing with DMSO and water, the dried powder (80°C) was subjected to a high-temperature annealing at 500°C (heating rate, 2°C min −1 ) for 5 h in a nitrogen flow. The synthesis of other metal UHD-SACs follows the same steps by using the appropriate metal precursor, solvent, annealing temperatures and atmospheres (Supplementary Table 1 ). Automated synthesis The automated catalyst preparation was carried out in a Chemspeed Flex Isynth synthesis platform. The distinct carriers (100 mg) were dispensed into the reaction block using an in-built extruder for precision dosing. After addition of ethanol (5 ml, ACS reagent grade, Millipore Sigma), the nickel precursor solution (NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O, 99.9% purity, Sigma Aldrich, in ethanol) of the desired molarity was added gravimetrically (5 ml). The resulting slurries were shaken (300 r.p.m.) for 30 min, and the solvent was subsequently removed under vacuum (80°C, 7 h). The dry powders were transferred to ceramic boats and annealed in flowing nitrogen (20 ml min −1 ) at 300°C (ramp, 5°C min −1 ). The annealed powders were subsequently washed (water:ethanol, 1:1, 15 ml) and vacuum-filtered (frit pore diameter, 16–40 µm) three times and then dried (80°C, vacuum) in the synthesis robot. Finally, the powders were subjected to a second annealing step to 550°C (ramp, 2°C min −1 ) in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere. Material"

No synthetic chemicals or solvents (including water) are used in the preparation process and therefore no by-products or waste are generated. Because kinetic energy is the driving force of the reaction, the processing cost can be further reduced by directly using natural sources of kinetic energy, such as wind or hydro power. In some cases, mild thermal treatment can further enhance the ratio of single atoms (from 75% to 96% for the Fe–N–C system) and render the SACs more thermodynamically stable. Because one metal cluster equals tens of single atoms, these clusters are so scarce as to be very difficult to detect by morphological"

Platinum chloride was dissolved in deionized water (0.002 g ml –1 ) and boiled at 100°C for 1 min. Subsequently, the prepared trisodium citrate solution (0.011 g ml –1 ) and sodium borohydride solution (0.76 mg ml –1 ) were added to the platinum chloride solution. The resulting mixture solution was stirred at 80°C for 10 min, and the colour change of the solution from yellow to black indicated the successful synthesis of Pt NPs. The final Pt NP solution, with acetone as an anti-solvent, was centrifuged at 1,555 rpm for 20 min. The concentration of Pt NPs was measured using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICPS-8100) at the National Center for Inter-University Research Facilities, Seoul National University. Synthesis of Pt/TiO 2 cryoeaeorgels The Pt NP solution (20 mg ml –1 ) was added to TiO 2 NP dispersion to obtain a Pt/TiO 2 colloidal solution (17 wt% Pt). The Pt/TiO 2 colloidal solution was homogeneously mixed using an ultrasonic liquid processor (Vibcra-Cell, VCX-750) for 2 h (40% amplitude), and the mixed solution was added dropwise to liquid nitrogen. After flash freezing for 10 min, the frozen solution was brought to a freeze dryer (Operon, FDU-7003) and kept under a vacuum (<20 mtorr) for 48 h. Synthesis of Cu-SA/TiO 2 NPs The synthesis procedure is based on a previously reported method 2 with appropriate modifications. Synthesis of silica NP template. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (0.86 ml) was added into mixed solutions of H 2 O (4.30 ml) and EtOH (23.00 ml) and stirred for 6 h. The products were centrifuged and washed with water and EtOH and redispersed in anhydrous EtOH (40 ml) for the next procedure. TiO 2 coating on the SiO 2 template. Acetonitrile (14.0 ml) and 28–30 wt% ammonia solution (0.4 ml) were added into the previously made SiO 2 NP solution (solution 1). The mixture was sonicated for 10 min. Another solution (solution 2) was made with titanium ( iv ) butoxide (0.8 ml) dissolved in a mixture of anhydrous EtOH (6.0 ml) and acetonitrile (2.0 ml). Solution 2 was added to solution 1 and stirred for 3 h. The products were centrifuged and washed with EtOH and water twice each and redispersed in H 2 O (40 ml) for the next step. Cu-SA adsorption on TiO 2 -coated SiO 2 NPs. Copper ( ii ) chloride dihydrate (4.0 mg) was added to the previously made TiO 2 -coated SiO 2 NP solution. The mixture was stirred for 3 h. The light-blue powder was centrifuged, washed with water and redispersed in H 2 O for the following procedure. Wrapping SiO 2 . Polyvinylpyrrolidone (0.4 g) was added to the solution in above and stirred overnight. The polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated product was centrifuged and redispersed in a solution of EtOH (46 ml) and H 2 O (9 ml). Tetraethyl orthosilicate (1.6 ml) and 28–30 wt% ammonia solution (1.2 ml) were added to the above solution. The reaction was conducted for 4 h. The product was centrifuged and washed with EtOH and water. The resulting powders were dried at 80°C in an electric oven overnight. Redistribution of Cu atoms. The product obtained in step was calcined at 900°C for 2 h. Etching SiO 2 for hollow Cu-SA/TiO 2 NPs. The calcined powder in step was dispersed in a 0.5 M sodium hydroxide solution. The solution was heated to 180°C with stirring. After 6 h of reaction, the product was centrifuged and washed with H 2 O and EtOH. The resulting powder was dried at 80°C in an electric oven overnight. Synthesis of Pt/g-C 3 N 4 NPs For the synthesis of g-C 3 N 4 , 5 g of urea was transferred to an alumina boat and calcined at 550°C for 2 h inside a muffle furnace. Then, 50 mg of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 was dispersed in a 20 ml gas-tight vial with 10 ml of 20% methanol aqueous solution. Chloroplatinic acid with an equivalent amount of 4 wt% Pt regarding g-C 3 N 4 was added to the reaction solution. The solution in the reaction cell was irradiated with ultraviolet–visible light (100 mW cm –2 ) under vigorous stirring. After 2 h, the product was washed with water and EtOH and dried at 50°C in an electric oven overnight. Fabrication of floatable photocatalytic elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposites To fabricate the photocatalytic layer, 3 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50.0 wt%) was prepared and EtOH was added to set the concentration of HPU as 10.5 wt%. NaCl was added to the HPU solution (final concentration of NaCl, 0.032 g ml –1 ), and 30 mg of photocatalysts was added to the HPU solution. After vigorous stirring, PPG was added to the HPU solution with a volume ratio of 1:2 (PPG:HPU). A mixed sol–gel state was obtained after the addition of PPG, and the gel phase was separated after 24 h. After moulding the gel into a circular shape with a diameter of 6 cm, EtOH and water in the gel phase were removed by drying at 60°C for two days, and the gel phase was reswollen in water to remove NaCl granules in the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite. The separated gel phase (photocatalytic layer) was fully swollen in water, and hydrophobic silica aerogel was added to the top surface of the photocatalytic layer. The fabrication of a supporting layer follows the same procedures, except starting with 16 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50 wt%) and skipping the addition of photocatalysts. The bilayer system of the nanocomposite was fabricated by integrating the photocatalytic layer and supporting layer with the aid of EtOH. EtOH was added dropwise on the top surface of the supporting layer, and the photocatalytic layer was attached to the supporting layer. The bilayer system was dried at 60°C for 24 h to remove EtOH and reswollen in water. Fabrication of PAM nanocomposites The acrylamide/bis-acrylamide solution (19:1) was added to the as-prepared acrylamide solution (0.156 g ml –1 ). Subsequently, a 10 wt% ammonium persulfate solution was added to the solution. The solution was degassed for 5 min. Then, 30 mg Pt/TiO 2 cryoaerogel and tetramethylethylenediamine solution were sequentially added. The resulting solution was poured into a circular mould with a diameter of 6 cm, and cured under ultraviolet irradiation for 2 h. Material"

Different molecular precursors including metal salts (M2+), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and thioacetamide were introduced in this one -pot synthesis. The thioacetamide precursor used here plays a remarkable role, namely “killing two birds with one stone”. Firstly, the decomposition o f thioacetamide during hydrothermal reaction not only provides S sources for the formation of 2H -phase MoS 2 host but also creates the desired acidic environment (Equation 1 -4) to facilitate the synthesis of atomically dispersed single atoms embedded into the carrier lattice by suppressing the formation of metallic nanoparticle. Such a process can be described b y the chemical equations 1-4 bellow . The key innovation in creating operando acidic conditions enables us to incorporate a high density of substitutional magnetic single -atom doping beyond the regime that has not been accessed by other hydrothermal synthes is methods.

After vigorous stirring for 12 h, CuZSM SA was successfully obtained. The obtained products were thoroughly washed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by centrifugation. Subsequently, they were dried in an oven at 60°C to remove any residual solvents, resulting in the final CuZSM SA product. The dried product was meticulously ground into a fine powder for further use. Subsequently, the porcelain boat-containing CuZSM SA was gradually heated to 550°C at a heating rate of 5°C min − 1 in a 5% H 2 /Ar atmosphere. The sample was maintained at this temperature for 6 h to ensure complete reduction. Upon natural cooling to room temperature, CuZSM SACL was successfully obtained. During the typical synthesis process of CuZSM CLNP, 1 g of ZSM-5 and 1 mg of CuSO 4 ·5H 2 O were first mixed thoroughly grinding. Subsequently, the mixture was heated to 550°C at a controlled heating rate of 5°C min − 1 in a 5% H 2 /Ar atmosphere. It was maintained at this temperature for 6 h to ensure complete reduction. The sample was naturally cooled to room temperature, resulting in the formation of CuZSM CLNP. The product was washed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by centrifugation, and then dried overnight at 60°C. Synthesis of Cu NPs-5 nm, Cu NPs-20 nm and Cu NPs-100 nm In a typical preparation of Cu NPs-5 nm, 13.3 mg Cu(acac) 2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 27 mg ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 ml oleylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 ml oleic acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) were mixed and ultrasonicated for approximately 0.5 h in a sealed vial (30 ml). Then, the vial was transferred into an oil bath and heated at 180°C for 3 h ( ). The resulting colloidal products in the vial were collected by centrifugation and then washed with an ethanol/cyclohexane mixture to obtain Cu NPs-5 nm. The preparations of Cu NPs-20 nm and Cu NPs-100 nm were similar to that of Cu NPs-5 nm but without adding oleic acid and ascorbic acid, respectively."

                "input": "How to synthesize Rh@MEL?",
                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41586-024-07342-y_synthesis, Synthesis of Rh@MEL materials The encapsulation of Rh within MEL zeolitic channels has never been reported previously, to our knowledge, and the syntheses of our new Rh@MEL materials were modified from the precedent one-pot hydrothermal crystallization recipe, in which encapsulation of Pt and Rh into the MFI channels was successfully achieved 26 , 27 . In the representative synthesis of the 0.17Rh@MEL , a gel solution was prepared by dissolving 0.030 g of KOH (0.5 mmol) in 2.32 ml of deionized H 2 O and then mixing with 3.880 g of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (6.0 mmol) and 4.120 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (19.8 mmol). A metal precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.0045 g of Rh(III) chloride hydrate (0.017 mmol) and 100 μl of ethylenediamine in 100 μl of deionized H 2 O. This metal precursor was added dropwise into the gel solution with vigorous stirring. The gel solution was then hydrolysed at 30°C for 10 h with stirring (500 r.p.m.). The molar composition of the obtained gel was 66.7 (K 2 O):5,282.6 (SiO 2 ):1,600.8 (TBAOH): 6,8921.1 (H 2 O):4.0 (Rh):400.2 (NH 2 CH 2 CH 2 NH 2 ). The resultant yellow solution was transferred into a 50-ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 130°C for 24 h under static conditions. Following the hydrothermal crystallization, the solid product was isolated by centrifugation and sequentially washed with deionized water and ethanol. Subsequently, it was dried at 80°C for 12 h in ambient air. The obtained solid sample was further calcined in static air at 560°C for 5 h and then reduced under a flow of H 2 /Ar mixture at 600°C for 2 h. The as-prepared sample was denoted 0.17Rh@MEL . Synthesis of Rh OD @MEL materials A CO pretreatment was subsequently conducted to disrupt Rh clusters into isolated atoms and thus generate the atomically dispersed Rh sites on the original 0.17Rh@MEL sample. For details, the 0.17Rh@MEL sample was loaded into quartz tubes and subjected to heating under a continuous flow of CO (0.5 MPa) at 90°C for 2 h. The Rh loading in the resulting 0.17Rh OD @MEL samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis. The syntheses of 0.05Rh OD @MEL and 0.33Rh OD @MEL were succeeded under identical conditions, except using different amounts of Rh(III) chloride hydrate (0.0012 g and 0.0092 g, respectively) within the previously mentioned synthesis procedure.

                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41586-024-08483-w_synthesis, Methods Synthesis of γ-Mo 2 N γ-Mo 2 N was synthesized using a temperature-programmed nitridation technique. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O) powder (10 g) was calcined in a muffle furnace at 500°C for 10 h to synthesize MoO 3 . Subsequently, 2 g of untreated MoO 3 powder was nitridated in pure ammonia flow (200 ml min −1 ) by the following temperature-programmed procedure: heated from room temperature to 350°C at a rate of 10°C min −1 , then to 450°C at 0.5°C min −1 and finally to 785°C at 2°C min −1 . The sample was held at 785°C for an additional 4 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subjected to passivation using 0.5% O 2 /Ar (60 ml min −1 ) as the passivation gas overnight to yield the γ-Mo 2 N powder. Synthesis of La and other metal modified γ-Mo 2 Ns La 2 O 3 (45.3 mg, 2 wt% La) or an adequate amount of other metal oxides or metal salts (Y 2 O 3 , Pr 2 O 3 , Ho 2 O 3 , CsNO 3 , Ca(NO 3 ) 2 and Sr(NO 3 ) 2 ) and 2 g MoO 3 powders were mechanically mixed and calcined in a muffle furnace at 500°C for 10 h to obtain the La 2 O 3 (or other metal oxides)-loaded MoO 3 precursor, which was subsequently subjected to nitridation using the same temperature-programmed nitridation method as for γ-Mo 2 N. Synthesis of α-MoC α-MoC was synthesized through a two-step temperature-programmed nitridation–carburization approach. Initially, 1 g of MoO 3 powder was heated in pure ammonia (160 ml min −1 ) from room temperature to 700°C at a rate of 5°C min −1 and maintained at 700°C for 2 h. After the nitridation process, the sample was cooled down to room temperature, then heated in 20% CH 4 /80% H 2 (160 ml min −1 ) to 700°C at 5°C min −1 and held at 700°C for 2 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subsequently subjected to passivation using 0.5% O 2 /Ar as the passivation gas overnight to obtain the α-MoC powder. Synthesis of Pt/γ-Mo 2 N, Pt/M-Mo 2 N and Pt/α-MoC A total of 400 mg of passivated γ-Mo 2 N (or M-Mo 2 N, α-MoC, where M = La, Pr, Y, Ho, Cs, Ca, Sr) powder was introduced into 15 ml of H 2 PtCl 6 solution of appropriate concentration and stirred in pure argon atmosphere for 1 h. The suspension was subsequently evaporated at 30–35°C to yield the corresponding Pt/γ-Mo 2 N (or Pt/M-Mo 2 N, Pt/α-MoC) catalyst. The Pt/γ-Mo 2 N and Pt/M-Mo 2 N catalysts were reduced at 350°C for 2 h under 10% H 2 /90% Ar, and the Pt/α-MoC catalysts were reduced at 590°C for 2 h under 15% CH 4 /85% H 2 before catalytic evaluation or characterizations. Synthesis of Pt/SiO 2 catalyst The reference Pt/SiO 2 catalyst was synthesized using the wetness impregnation method. H 2 PtCl 6 solution (800 µl) of appropriate concentration was added to 1 g of hydrophilic SiO 2 powder. The mixture was stirred until dry and further dried in a vacuum oven at 60°C overnight. The catalyst was reduced at 350°C for 2 h under 10% H 2 /90% Ar before catalytic evaluation or characterizations. Elemental analysis of catalysts Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy was used to determine the concentrations of metal elements in the sample series using a Prodigy 7 instrument. Before analysis, the samples were dissolved in aqua regia and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction patterns were acquired on a PANalytical Powder X-ray diffractometer using a Cu-Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 40 mA. Before analysis, the samples were subjected to passivation to ensure stability under ambient conditions. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms Analyses were performed at −196°C using an ASAP 2020 Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry System. The samples were pretreated under a dynamic vacuum for 12 h to eliminate guest molecules and adsorbed moisture. Passivation was performed before analysis to maintain stability in an air atmosphere. Scanning transmission electron microscopy Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization was conducted on an aberration-corrected Nion HERMES-100 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV with a convergence semi-angle of 32 mrad. The collection semi-angles for STEM-HAADF imaging and EELS chemical mapping were 75–210 mrad and 0–75 mrad, respectively. The energy dispersion of EELS was set to 0.39 eV per channel or 0.89 eV per channel. As the low-dispersion settings have an inevitable nonlinearity of the energy dispersion at the two ends of the spectrometer prism, the onsets of the La L 3 edges were shifted to 832 eV to correct the slight offsets of the absolute energy-loss values. The EELS spectra shown in and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13 were normalized by integrating the signals within the energy-loss range of 800–820 eV. The EELS analyses of other elements were carried out in the same manner with La. The catalyst samples were embedded in resin and sectioned into approximately 30 nm slices using ultramicrotomy for STEM-EELS characterization. Moreover, a subset of STEM-HAADF images, EELS spectra and EDS spectra were obtained using aberration-corrected FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 and JEOL GrandARM2 microscopes operating at 300 kV and 200 kV with the convergence semi-angles of 25 mrad and 32 mrad, respectively. For STEM-EDS analysis, the samples were prepared by depositing ethanol-sample suspensions onto grids coated with holey carbon film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Quasi-in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of various catalysts were measured on an Axis Supra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical) using a monochromatized Al Kα radiation source. After activation or reaction, all catalysts were transferred to the measurement chamber without exposure to air. XPS with tunable photon energy for Pt/γ-Mo 2 N and Pt/La-Mo 2 N catalysts were acquired at beamline BL02B01 at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The activated samples were transferred to the chamber under the protection of Ar in a glove bag. For XPS measurements at SSRF, the typical X-ray spot size is about 120 μm (H) × 15 μm (V) and the incident angle is 15°, giving an elongated X-ray beam projection of around 460 μm (H) × 15 μm (V) on the sample. All these XPS spectra were processed using CasaXPS software. X-ray absorption spectroscopy Pt L 3 -edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra were measured at the beamline 1W1B of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility, which operates at 2.5 GeV with a current of 250 mA, and beamline BL14W1 SSRF, which operates at 3.5 GeV with a current of 350 mA. An Si double crystal monochromator was used. The data were acquired in fluorescence mode using Lytle or a 19-element Ge solid-state detector as detectors. The samples were sealed in Kapton films under an argon atmosphere following activation and transferred to a glove box without air exposure. The XAS data were processed and analysed using the Demeter software package 36 . Raman spectroscopy Raman experiments were performed on a Horiba JY HR800 Raman spectrometer, whereas in situ and quasi-in-situ experiments were conducted using a Horiba LabRAM HR Raman spectrometer. The excitation laser wavelength was 532 nm. After a 36-h methanol-reforming reaction (150 mg catalysts, 200°C, 5 bar, methanol/H 2 O = 1/3 (mol), weight-hourly space velocity of MeOH (WHSV MeOH ) = 12.87 h −1 ), an accelerated-deactivation experiment (water treatment experiment) by feeding pure water vapour (200°C, WHSV water = 21.72 h −1 , 350 kPa) into the reactor containing 1Pt/α-MoC, 1Pt/γ-Mo 2 N or 1Pt/2La-Mo 2 N catalyst for 12 h. The catalysts at fresh state (state i), and those after 36-h methanol-reforming reaction (state ii) and then the 12-h water treatment (state iii) were transferred into a Raman chamber without air exposure (by a glove box) for measurement (b ). For in situ experiments (results shown in Supplementary ), the samples were reduced in a Raman chamber first in 10% H 2 /90% Ar at 350°C for 2 h, then cooled down to room temperature. After heating to 200°C in Ar with a heating rate of 10°C min −1 , the methanol–water vapour mixture was introduced into the chamber and the Raman spectra were measured at the same time. The products were simultaneously analysed with Agilent 990 Micro Gas Chromatography (Supplementary ). Temperature-programmed surface reaction and temperature-programmed desorption experiments The desorption behaviours of methanol on the catalysts were examined by the temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectroscopy technique. Before the reaction, γ-Mo 2 N, Pt/γ-Mo 2 N and Pt/SiO 2 catalysts were reduced in 10% H 2 /90% Ar at 350°C for 2 h with a heating rate of 10°C min −1 . Then the system was purged by Ar flow (30 ml min −1 ). After that, saturated methanol vapour was introduced into the system from a bubbler that was maintained at 30°C by 30 ml min −1 Ar flow until saturation adsorption. Then, the system was further purged by Ar flow until no signal of physisorbed methanol ( m / z = 31) could be detected. Signals for H 2 ( m / z = 2), CH 4 ( m / z = 16), H 2 O ( m / z = 18), CO ( m / z = 28), CH 3 OH ( m / z = 31), Ar ( m / z = 40) and CO 2 ( m / z = 44) were recorded using a Pfeiffer Vacuum OMNIstar mass spectrometer. The methanol–water temperature-programmed surface reaction experiments use a similar experimental procedure as CH 3 OH temperature-programmed desorption, except for the adsorption stage. The water-to-methanol molar ratio in the liquid phase was maintained at 5:1 to ensure that the partial pressure of water was slightly higher than that of methanol in the gas phase at 30°C. Transient kinetic analysis Water TKA experiments were conducted using α-MoC, γ-Mo 2 N and 2M-Mo 2 N (M = La, Pr, Cs, and Sr) catalysts at 100°C. TKA setup is equipped with a dual-channel tube furnace with a reactor tube and a bypassing tube, and an online mass spectrometer system 9 . A four-way valve with an air actuator allowed for the switching of reaction gases between the reaction tube and the bypass tube. The reactor tube was loaded with 20 mg of passivated catalyst, whereas the bypass tube was not. After reduction, the TKA experimental procedures were started. First, 10 ml min −1 Ar was switched into the reactor to protect the catalyst, then 10 ml min −1 reactant gas mixture (H 2 O:Ne:Ar = 1:4:75) was prepared in flow-controlled manifolds and detected by the mass spectrometer until the signals were stabilized. The water was introduced into the system by 2 ml min −1 Ar passing through the water bath at 303 K. Second, after the signals of reactant gas stabilized, the downstream four-way valve was switched, and the outflow from the reactor tube was detected by the mass spectrometer. Third, a switch from 10 ml min −1 Ar to 10 ml min −1 H 2 O:Ne:Ar = 1:4:75 was performed quickly without any pressure fluctuation, and the transient signals were recorded by an online mass spectrometer. Finally, after 20 min, the 10 ml min −1 reactant gas was switched back to 10 ml min −1 Ar. Until the signals stabilized, the water TKA experiments were repeated (d ). In the experiments, when the fresh catalyst initially contacts with water, it undergoes both reversible and irreversible adsorption processes. For the irreversible adsorption part, a fraction of the water molecules dissociate, producing hydrogen in the effluent, and hydroxyls on the surface of the catalyst 37 . In the subsequent second water TKA experiment, as the catalyst interacts with water for the second instance, merely reversible adsorption happens, and no obvious production of hydrogen is observed. By subtracting the water signal ( m / z = 18) of the first round of TKA experiments from that of the second TKA experiment, the amount of irreversible water adsorption under this specific reaction condition can be obtained (e ). By calibrating the signal of H 2 ( m / z = 2) and H 2 O ( m / z = 18) relative to Ar ( m / z = 40), the production of hydrogen produced and the irreversible adsorption of water can be estimated (the results are shown in f ). Theoretical calculations All calculations were executed within the density functional theory (DFT) framework using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (refs. 37 , 38 ). The projector-augmented wave method was used to describe the interaction between the ions and electrons. Electron–electron exchange and correlation interactions were characterized using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional within the generalized gradient approximation 39 . A plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV and Gaussian electron smearing with a sigma of 0.02 eV was used to ensure accurate energies. The structures were relaxed using either the conjugate gradient algorithm or the quasi-Newton scheme until forces on all unfixed atoms were less than 0.01 eV Å −1 . The γ-Mo 2 N unit cell in Fm3m crystallographic symmetry was used. The calculated lattice parameters (4.17 Å) closely matched the experimental data (4.16 Å). A six-atom-layer slab modelled the γ-Mo 2 N surface. Vacuum thickness was set to 15 Å to separate the slab in the z directions, which was sufficient to avoid electronic coupling between adjacent slabs in test calculations. During geometry optimization, atoms in the bottom two layers were fixed as those in the bulk structure, whereas atoms in the four upper surface layers and the adsorbate were relaxed. For the methanol-reforming mechanism calculation, γ-Mo 2 N , Pt 1 /γ-Mo 2 N and Pt with 2 × 2 supercells were chosen, using (3 × 3 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack k-point sampling. For LaO x adsorption on γ-Mo 2 N , a six-layer 4 × 4 supercell slab model was used. The DFT + U method was applied to the f orbitals of La, with a validated U eff value of 7 eV for La from previous work on La 2 O 3 ( ). The energy profile of the reaction routes was described starting from CH 3 OH and H 2 O molecules. The energy profile of the intermediate relative to CH 3 OH and H 2 O and the clean catalyst slab model was defined as E binding = E (adsorbates/slab) − E (CH 3 OH) − E (H 2 O) − E (slab), where E (slab), E (CH 3 OH), E (H 2 O) and E (adsorbate/slab) represent the optimized clean slab, free CH 3 OH, H 2 O and relaxed adsorbates–slab complex energies, respectively. The activation barriers for elementary steps were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method 41 . Furthermore, the product adsorption energy was defined as E ads = E (product/slab) − E (product) − E (slab), where E (slab), E (product) and E (product/slab) represent the optimized clean slab, free product molecule and relaxed product–slab complex energies, respectively. According to the aforementioned definition, a negative value signifies an exothermic process, whereas positive values indicate endothermic processes. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functionals were combined with D3 dispersion corrections to account for dispersion force fields 37 . Furthermore, vibrational frequencies were used to compute the zero-point energies of adsorbate intermediates and free molecules. Note that the energies of all configurations presented in this work include corrections for dispersion (D3) and zero-point energy."

By aging the sample in the presence of reactants at 900°C, we did not observe the formation of CeAlO 3. However, treatment at 1,150°C led to complete transformation of ceria into ~ 25nm CeAlO 3 crystals as evidenced by XRD and microscopy The fraction of Ce3+ and Ce4+ was determined by two different methods (described below). Note: CeO 2 has a very small pre -edge peak (5.719 keV) and 3 peaks at 5.7241, 5.7280 and 5.7352 keV (ChemPhysChem 2016, 17, 3494 – 3503); Ce3+ has a single peak at lower energy. Also, as an L 3 edge, the XANES shape and energy is dependent on the exact number of bonds and bond distance to the absorbing atom. Thus, determination of a Ce3+ XANES from this oxide is necessary to get a more precise XANES fit for the composition. Previously, many papers use Ce(NO 3)3 x H 2O for Ce3+ XANES fitting; however, these oxides likely have a different CN and R, thus, a better choice is a Ce3+ from the phase that is present. L3 Ce XANES from 5.68 -5.75 keV for Ce 4+ and Ce3+ CeA08 Oxides CeAl08 CeO 2 (Ce4+ as received) CeAl08 Ce 2O3 NOTE: The Ce3+ CA08 oxide was obtained by: 1) The fraction of Ce4+ (0.34) in the reactively 900°C CeAl08 aged sample reduced in H 2 400 C was determined by the ratio of the height of the peak in both samples at 5.7352 keV where there is no peak in Ce3+ samples; 2) The XANES of the Ce4+ CeAl08 (as received) sample, was multiplied by 0.34 and subtracted from the C eAl08 aged sample reduced in H 2 400 C sample; and 3) The difference XANES spectrum, i.e., Ce3+ CeAl08 oxide, which represents 66% of the Ce in the sample, was normalized by dividing by 0.66. Note: CeO 2 has a very small pre -edge peak (5.719 keV) and 3 peaks at 5.7241, 5.7280 and 5.7352 keV (ChemPhysChem 2016, 17, 3494 – 3503); Ce3+ is a single peak at lower energy. 1. CA08 as is XANES energy shape, EXAFS and higher shells are identical to the CeO 2 Standard a. CeO 2 has a very small pre -edge peak (5.719 keV) and 3 peaks at 5.7241, 5.7280 and 5.7352 keV ( Physica Scripta 2005, T115, 802 –806; ChemPhysChem 2016, 17, 3494 – 3503) b. CeAl08 has the same 4 peaks as CeO 2 at the same energies; this is used at the Ce4+ XANES reference. c. Method 1: Ce3+ compounds do not have a XANES peak at 5.7352 keV (see reference literature compounds). The fraction of Ce4+ was determined from the height of this peak (above the normalized edge step) compared to that for CeO 2 (CeAl08). d. Method 2: A Ce3+ reference for this oxide was determine by determining the fraction of Ce4+ for sample C eAl08 aged reduced at 400°C in H 2. The ratio of the heights (method 1) gave 34% Ce4+. The XANES of C eAl08 was multiplied by 0.34 and subtracted from CA08 aged reduced at 400°C in H 2. The difference file gave no peak at 5.7352 keV indicating all the Ce4+ had been removed from the spectrum. The resulting XANES was due to 66% of the Ce in the sample. This Ce3+ XANES was normalized by dividing the spectrum by 0.66 and used as a C e3+ CeAl08 oxide to fit the other mixed valent state CA08 oxides. e. The fraction of Ce3+ in the other samples was determined by a linear combination of the Ce3+ and Ce4+ CA08 oxides. There is a n agreement between these two methods in estimating the relative fractions of Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ (the only two oxidation states of ceria in our samples) for various C eAl08 samples."

                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41929-018-0146-x_synthesis, synthesis of these materials often require tedious procedures and lack appropriate interactions between the metal atoms and supports. Here, we report a simple and practical strategy to access the large-scale synthesis of single-atom catalysts via direct atoms emitting from bulk metals, and the subsequent trapping on nitrogen-rich porous carbon with the assistance of ammonia. First, the ammonia coordinates with the copper atoms to form volatile Cu(NH 3 ) x species based on the strong Lewis acid–base interaction. Then, following transportation under an ammonia atmosphere, the Cu(NH 3 ) x species are trapped by the defects on the nitrogen-rich carbon support, forming the isolated copper sites. This strategy is readily scalable and has been confirmed as feasible for producing functional single-atom catalysts at industrial levels.

Various synthetic strategies, including physical and chemical approaches, have emerged in recent years as enabling platforms to access SACs. The physical methods, such as mass-selected soft-landing 17 and atomic layer deposition 3 , 18 , suffer from low yields and high costs that are not favourable for large-scale production. The chemical routes involve tedious synthetic processes, including the adsorption of metal precursors, followed by reduction and stabilization on defect-rich supports 19 , 20 , 21 . The reported chemical synthesis routes are also relatively difficult to scale up because of the complex operating steps and sensitive conditions. Furthermore, under a high reactive temperature, aggregation and sintering of small nanoparticles and single atoms on the support is inevitable to some extent, which greatly hinders the practical applications of SACs. Therefore, the development of a practical and straightforward strategy for the synthesis of SACs with high thermal/chemical stability and ease of mass production is particularly attractive in the field. In a recent interesting and pioneering example, Datye and co-workers described the preparation of platinum single atoms supported on CeO 2 by thermal diffusion from platinum nanoparticles 4 , 22 . In contrast with the synthesis of SACs from nanoparticles, studies of the direct fabrication of SACs from cheap and readily available bulk metal materials have rarely been reported. Here, we describe a facile gas-migration strategy to directly transform bulk materials into single atoms onto a support with great potential for large-scale production. A schematic of the reaction is shown in a : copper foam and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) were placed separately in a porcelain boat. The formation mechanism of copper single atoms supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu-SAs/N-C) is proposed in b . First, the ZIF-8 was subjected to a pyrolysis process under an argon atmosphere at 1,173 K, forming pyrolysed ZIF-8 with empty zinc nodes and abundant defect sites. Under an ammonia atmosphere, ammonia molecules haul the surface copper atoms out of copper foam to form volatile Cu(NH 3 ) x species based on strong Lewis acid–base interactions. Then, the Cu(NH 3 ) x species were trapped by the defects of the nitrogen-rich carbon support, generating the isolated Cu-SAs/N-C catalysts. In addition, a series of M-SAs/N-C (M = Co or Ni) could be fabricated using this gas-migration method, demonstrating its generality to access a variety of functional SACs. : Schematic of the preparation of Cu-SAs/N-C. a , Apparatus diagram. b , Proposed reaction mechanism.

The Ir nitrate precursor (8.7 wt% Ir, Furuya Metal Co.) was added into the pH-adjusted solution. The MgAl 2 O 4 support was then added into the solution while stirring. The final pH of the solution was 9.5. The nominal Ir weight loading was 0.0025%. After 12 h of stirring, the solution was filtered out and the solid sample was dried in air for 24 h at room temperature.

The dried materials were then heat treated in a number of ways and tested for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-NS. For a typical catalyst preparation (2 g), the requisite amount of aqueous hydrogen hexachloroplatinic acid solution (9.6 mg Pt ml –1 , assay 30.21% H 2 PtCl 6 , Johnson Matthey) was diluted to 16 ml using deionized water, and heated in an oil bath to 60°C with vigorous stirring (800 r.p.m.) before the addition of the requisite amount of support (TiO 2 , Evonik P25). The temperature was subsequently increased to 95°C for 16 h to dry the slurry in air. The resultant material was then ground thoroughly (referred to as the ‘fresh dried-only’ sample). A portion (500 mg) of the dried-only sample was either calcined in static air or reduced under a steady flow of 5% H 2 /Ar. Heat treatments were carried out at 450°C for 4 h with a heating rate of 10°C min −1 . All of these materials were tested as catalysts without any further treatment unless stated otherwise. Hydrogenation of 3-NS Liquid phase chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-NS was performed in a 50 ml round-bottomed glass Colaver reactor. In a typical reaction, 3-NS (0.2 ml), toluene (8 ml) and catalyst (50 mg) were charged in the reactor that was then purged with N 2 to remove traces of air before being immersed in an oil bath set at 40°C. After purging the reactor three times with 3 bar H 2 while stirring, the reaction was commenced. After a pre-determined reaction time, the reactor was cooled to <5°C using ice, after which aliquots of the reaction mixture were collected and centrifuged to remove the solid catalyst.

The mixture was stirred for 1 h and then added dropwise to TiO 2 (0.24 g). In the wet-impregnation method for preparing the catalyst, the water volume used was larger than that needed to saturate the TiO 2 surface, so a suspension liquid (Supplementary ) rather than a glue-like sample was formed. The formation of the suspension liquid allowed the mixtures to be stirred vigorously for 2 h and then the sample was dried overnight in an oven at 120°C and subsequently reduced in H 2 at a flow rate of 20 ml min –1 and a heating rate of 2°C min –1 to 400°C, with the target temperature held for 3 h. The sample was subsequently cooled to room temperature and protected under N 2 for 1 h prior to removal from the tube reactor for the catalytic reactions or other tests. The other ruthenium catalysts, including Ru/Al 2 O 3 and Ru/ZrO 2 , were synthesized according to similar recipes, except the support. RuCl 3 , Ru/C, TiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Subsequently, the two solutions were mixed with vigorous stirring for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the as-obtained mixed solution was transferred to a sealed container and placed into a constant-temperature oven at 35°C for 2 h. Finally, the as-obtained ZIF-8 was centrifuged, washed with methanol and dried at 80°C for 12 h. For the synthesis of Fe/ZIF-8@PZM, 160 mg of bis(4-aminophenyl) ether and 80 mg of phosphonitrilic chloride trimer were dissolved in 50 ml methanol.

CeO 2 nanorods were prepared according to a procedure reported elsewhere 35 , 36 . The synthesis scheme is depicted in Supplementary a . In brief, 25 g of NaOH (reagent grade ≥98%) was dissolved in 30 ml of demineralized water. A solution of 2.17 g of Ce(NO 3 )∙6H 2 O (99% purity) in 5 ml of demineralized water was prepared. Subsequently, the two solutions were poured together, and the obtained slurry was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Next, the volume was increased to ~100 ml by adding demineralized water and the slurry was transferred into a 125 ml Teflon liner. This liner was then sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave, which was placed in an oven for 24 h at 100°C. After cooling in a water bath, the obtained precipitate was washed with five cycles of centrifugation, decantation and redispersion until a pH of ~7–8 was obtained. The resulting solid was dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 80°C and then calcined in air at 500°C. Subsequently, a Pd wet impregnation of CeO 2 nanorods using Pd(NO 3 )∙2H 2 O as the Pd precursor was performed. An appropriate amount of Pd salt was dissolved in demineralized water (10 ml) and poured onto the calcined CeO 2 powder. The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min at room temperature and then slowly heated to evaporate the water without boiling. The obtained solid was dried overnight at 110°C and subsequently calcined in air at 300°C. The calcined samples were denoted as 1PdRods and 5PdRods, depending on the intended Pd loading. The FSP synthesis was performed using a commercial TETHIS NPS10 apparatus. The principal scheme of the synthesis set-up can be found in Supplementary b . The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Ce(acac)∙H 2 O (99.9% purity) and Pd(acac) 2 ∙H 2 O (99% purity) salts (acac, acetylacetone) in glacial acetic acid (99.7% purity), which gave rise to a 0.1 M Ce precursor solution, and the Pd molarity was varied to target a particular Pd loading. To increase the solubility of the salts, the solution was heated slightly to ~50°C and stirred for 0.5 h. The fully transparent solution was then transferred into the syringe of the FSP set-up. The solution was injected at a feed rate of 5 ml min −1 into the methane/oxygen flame (1.5 l min −1 of methane and 3.0 l min −1 of oxygen). An oxygen flow of 5.0 l min −1 was used for the dispersion of the solution, which gave rise to an overpressure at the nozzle of ~2.5 bar. On pyrolysis in the flame, the NPs were formed and deposited on the quartz fibre filter in the upper part of the set-up (Supplementary ). The powders collected from the filter were denoted as 1PdFSP and 5PdFSP, depending on the intended Pd loading."

                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41929-021-00680-4_synthesis, Catalyst preparation The initial experiments to investigate the role of atom-trapped Pt were performed with the commercial ceria (Solvay-Rhodia HS 5, also referred to as HSA ceria since it has a higher surface area than the ceria prepared by calcination of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 , which was used for the Pd–Pt catalysts). To prepare engineered CeO 2 , tetraamineplatinum nitrate solution was impregnated onto CeO 2 powder by conventional wet impregnation, followed by drying at 120°C for 12 h. The powder was then calcined at 800°C for 10 h in flowing air. The obtained materials were denoted as 1Pt@CeO 2 and 3Pt@CeO 2 , corresponding to the Pt loadings of 1 and 3 wt.%, respectively. The high temperature treatment causes a drop in BET surface area, from 135 m 2 g −1 for the as-received ceria to 60 m 2 g −1 for the pure ceria (PS ceria), 78 m 2 g −1 for 1Pt@CeO 2 and 100 m 2 g −1 for the 3Pt@CeO 2 sample. The Pt interacts strongly with the ceria surface, pinning defect sites and slowing the rate of ceria sintering 26 , 35 . The nucleation and growth of Pt on PS CeO 2 support (precalcined at 800°C in air for 10 h) and the 1Pt@CeO 2 (subjected to a similar thermal treatment) helped identify the role of trapped Pt atoms during catalyst preparation. An appropriate amount of tetraamineplatinum nitrate (Pt(NH 3 ) 4 (NO 3 ) 2 ) was added to each support followed by drying at 120°C for 12 h and calcination at 500°C for 4 h in air. The total Pt loading for each catalyst was 3 wt.% Pt and the samples were denoted as 3 wt.%Pt/PS ceria and 2Pt/1Pt@CeO 2 . For the methane oxidation study, we used ceria powder prepared in the laboratory via decomposition of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 , as described in our previous work 26 . This ceria powder has a BET surface area of 85 m 2 g −1 as prepared. To prepare the engineered catalyst support, we used 2 wt.% Pt via impregnation, drying in air, calcination at 500°C following by ageing in air at 800°C for 10 h. This catalyst support is denoted as 2Pt@CeO 2 . Palladium nitrate (1.09 wt.% Pd) was deposited on the 2Pt@CeO 2 by wet impregnation, followed by drying at 120°C for 12 h and calcining at 500°C for 4 h in air. The catalyst was denoted as 1Pd/2Pt@CeO 2 . To provide a comparison, we also prepared two reference samples of 1Pd/CeO 2 (1.09 wt.%Pd) and (1Pd + 2Pt)/CeO 2 containing the same loading of metal as the 1Pd/2Pt@CeO 2 . For the reference (1Pd + 2Pt)/CeO 2 catalyst (BET surface area 64 m 2 g −1 ), the palladium(II) nitrate solution was impregnated onto the CeO 2 first, then dried at 120°C in air for 12 h. After calcination at 500°C in air for 4 h, tetraamineplatinum nitrate (2 wt.% Pt) was impregnated onto the material progressively, followed by drying at 120°C for 12 h in air and calcining at 500°C for 4 h in air. The Pd/CeO 2 (1.09 wt.%Pd) sample was prepared by impregnating appropriate amount of palladium(II) nitrate solution onto the CeO 2 . Then, the sample was obtained after drying at 120°C in air for 12 h and calcining at 500°C in air for 4 h. The morphological properties of this set of catalysts are shown in Supplementary Table 1 .

Next, the graphite die was transferred into a spark plasma sintering system (Fuji-211lx) where it was sintered at 1,450°C for 60 minutes and subjected to a uniaxial pressure of 30 MPa. The synthesized Mo 2 TiAlC 2 disk was then hand-pulverized in a synthetic sapphire mortar to pass through a 400-mesh screen. The Mo 2 TiAlC 2 powder was etched with HF (48%) at 55°C for 72 hours.

The working electrode was the catalyst-coated carbon paper mentioned above, and a Pt mesh was deployed as the counter electrodes. A leak-free Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference. The current density was normalized to the working electrode’s geometrical area (1 cm 2 ). All the electrochemical experiments were performed in a CO 2 -purged electrolyte (CO 2 flow rate, 30 ml min –1 ). The pH value of each is presented in Supplementary Table 1 . Product analysis A Shimadzu 2014 on-line gas chromatograph was utilized for product quantification. The gas stream was separated by Hayesep Q + R columns and then analysed by a thermoconductivity detector and flame ionization detector. The thermoconductivity detector detects the volume percentage of the H 2 product, and the flame ionization detector measures the CO after methanization. On all the NiNC type catalysts, no liquid product was found after the electrolysis. Calculations of the production rate, partial current density and Faradaic efficiency are given in the Supplementary Methods . Data availability All computational data, which include the adsorption energies of CO 2 , COOH and CO, optimized atomic coordinates, data for plotting density of states and microkinetic analysis are available at https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:ws-7t .

The Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst was prepared by the deposition–precipitation method 27 . In a typical synthesis, 1.0 g of CeO 2 nanorods was dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred at 400 r.p.m. for 1 h; at this stage it is termed CeO 2 aqueous dispersion. Then, 5.6 mg of Rh (III) nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, ~36% Rh basis), which provided ~2.0 mg of Rh metal, was weighed and dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water. The prepared Rh salt solution was slowly introduced into the prepared CeO 2 aqueous dispersion by syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min –1 while the aqueous solution was being stirred, creating an aqueous mixture containing both Rh 3+ and CeO 2 nanorods. This aqueous mixture of Rh 3+ and ceria nanorods was continuously stirred for an additional 3 h. The pH of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradual introduction of ammonium hydroxide solution (Aldrich, 28%) while the aqueous mixture was being stirred, followed by continuous stirring for an additional 5 h. The aqueous mixture was then centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, after which the upper layer was decanted. The solid product thus obtained was dried at 60°C in an oven overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 250°C for 2 h to obtain the as-synthesized Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst. The actual loading of Rh on CeO 2 nanorods of the as-synthesized catalyst was measured by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry, and was found to be 0.17 wt%. Thus, either 0.17 wt% Rh/CeO 2 or Rh 1 /CeO 2 is used interchangeably to denote the as-synthesized catalyst in the following sections. Catalytic tests The catalyst (50 mg) was mixed with 300 mg of quartz for SRM. The catalytic performance of the Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst was evaluated in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the temperature range 350–600°C. A K-type thermal couple was inserted into the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature, which was controlled by a proportional integral derivative controller. The catalyst was pretreated in H 2 (5% in Ar, 20 ml min –1 ) at 500°C for 1 h before catalysis. Water was introduced by syringe pump, in the form of vapour formed in a vaporization chamber held at 120°C, before entering the reactor. Water vapour flow rate was kept at twice that of CH 4 (10% in Ar, 20 ml min –1 ), which was premixed with water vapour before being flowed into the reactor. To ensure that water vapour could be fully delivered to the catalyst bed, all stainless steel tubing and valves between the vaporization chamber and reactor were heated and maintained at 120°C during"

                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41929-023-00996-3_synthesis, Catalyst preparation Au/TiO 2 catalysts were synthesized in a foil-wrapped flask via urea deposition–precipitation 35 . The desired amount of HAuCl 4 •3H 2 O and urea (2.52 g, 0.42 M) were added to 250 ml H 2 O with stirring. This yellow/orange solution was heated with stirring until the temperature was stable at 80°C. TiO 2 powder (6 g) was then added, and the slurry was stirred at 80°C for 4 h. After 4 h, the stirring was stopped and the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature, resulting in a yellow paste and clear solution. The solid was isolated via vacuum filtration and washed thoroughly with ~100 ml H 2 O followed by ~100 ml 0.1 M NH 4 OH, and then H 2 O until the filtrate was pH 7; the absence of Au and Cl − were confirmed with NaBH 4 and AgNO 3 tests, respectively. The washed solid was dried at room temperature under vacuum for 16 h and stored at 4°C under air. The Au/TiO 2 catalysts were prepared by heating the supported precursors in flowing 50% v/v H 2 and N 2 . The material was loaded into a tube furnace, heated at 5°C min −1 to desired temperature (Supplementary Table 1 ) and held at the reduction temperature for 1 h, cooled to room temperature and stored at 4°C under air. Volumetric H 2 adsorption All volumetric adsorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Previously pre-treated catalysts (that is, previously reduced supported Au precursor) were used for H 2 adsorption studies. The sample (200–300 mg) was loaded into a U-tube, evacuated at 150°C for 1 h and then reduced in flowing H 2 at 150°C for 1 h to remove any adsorbed oxygen. Following the pre-treatment, the sample was evacuated, purged with helium for 30 min and cooled to the analysis temperature under an active vacuum. A series of two isotherm H 2 adsorption experiments were performed at 60, 90 and 120°C; the sample was evacuated to at least 10 μm Hg for 1 h at the adsorption temperature between isotherms. We note any adsorbed oxygen in the system must be removed before reversible H 2 adsorption can be observed either via volumetric adsorption or with Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy. Once care is taken to remove adsorbed oxygen, the first and the second isotherms are essentially indistinguishable. Therefore, for all further volumetric adsorption measurements described hereafter, reported hydrogen uptakes were determined by averaging the first and second isotherms at each pressure point. FTIR spectroscopy IR spectra were collected on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 470 FTIR spectrometer in a home-built heated (20–300°C) transmission flow cell. Gas flow rates were controlled using rotameters calibrated with a bubble flowmeter. Water in the feed gases was minimized by passing the reactive gas through a dry ice–isopropanol moisture trap immediately before entering the IR cell. For H 2 adsorption experiments, ~40–50 mg of catalyst sample was pressed (3 tons of pressure for 10 s) into a 13 mm circular pellet, which was mounted in the flow cell. The sample pellet was pre-treated under 25 standard cubic centimetres per minute (SCCM) of N 2 at 300°C for 1 h to eliminate surface carbonates, and then cooled to 50°C. The vapour pressure of water at −78°C is 0.5 mTorr (660 ppb). Even with the dry ice–isopropanol bath, sub-ppm levels of residual water from the gas stream adsorb on the surface at lower temperatures. We allowed the surface water coverage to equilibrate until the water bending band at 1,620 cm −1 was stable before conducting further experiments. On the basis of our previous work and the absorbance of the δ HOH bending vibration, we estimate the surface water coverage to be around 2–3 H 2 O molecules nm −2 ( ). After stabilization of the water bending mode, a mixture of 20 SCCM H 2 and 25 SCCM N 2 was flowed over the catalyst at 50°C for 1 h to ensure no weakly adsorbed O 2 remained on the pellet. Catalysts were kept under N 2 flow to ensure the weakly adsorbed H 2 is removed. H 2 adsorption experiments were then performed at desired temperatures by flowing the desired ratio of H 2 and N 2 over the catalyst. Transmission electron microscopy Gold particle sizes were determined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Catalysts were imaged with scanning/transmission electron microscopy using an FEI Talos F200X microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. A small quantity of each sample was crushed in an agate mortar and dispersed in ethanol with sonication. A few drops of this suspension were placed on a Cu TEM grid (Ted Pella) and allowed to dry before inserting into the microscope for analysis. The number-averaged diameter for Au nanoparticles was determined with ImageJ from the measurement of >200 particles (Supplementary ). Supplementary Table 1 compiles TEM, and BET"

Notably, despite its similar initial ORR activity with Fe 0.5 NC, the Fe 0.5 NC–Pt reveals much better retention of ORR activity during a 2 h potentiostatic hold (−35% and −60% for Fe 0.5 NC–Pt and Fe 0.5 NC, respectively; a ). The GDE/EFC/ICP–MS results measured under Ar flow show ~3 times less Fe leaching from Fe 0.5 NC–Pt than Fe 0.5 NC (that is, 465 and 1,285 μg Fe g catal −1 , respectively; b ), without discernable Pt dissolution (Supplementary ). Unlike Fe 0.5 NC (e ), the lifetime-dependent stability diagram of Fe 0.5 NC–Pt shows a close interrelation of j loss with a decrease in TOF, rather than a decrease in SD (Supplementary ). Thus, these results imply that the enhanced stability of Fe 0.5 NC–Pt may result from the stabilization of Fe–N 4 sites against demetallation as a consequence of the introduction of isolated Pt sites in the carbon matrix. : Proof-of-concept strategy with isolated Pt ion as a stabilizer of Fe–N 4 sites. a , b , ORR current density ( a ) and real-time Fe dissolution under Ar flow ( b ) of Fe 0.5 NC/GDE and Fe 0.5 NC–Pt/GDE obtained by online GDE/EFC/ICP–MS during 2 h potential hold at 0.6 V RHE and 353 K.

For comparison, the initial PRR polarization curve of Pt/C is also shown. Full size image We further found that the enhanced stability, concluded from the GDE/EFC/ICP–MS system, was also transferred to the PEMFC. At the beginning of operation, the Fe 0.5 NC–Pt cathode showed similar PEMFC performance to that of the Fe 0.5 NC cathode. However, PEMFC with Fe 0.5 NC–Pt cathode exhibited much superior stability during 50 h of operation at 0.5 V (c,d ; the cell voltage corresponds to the cathode potential of ~0.6 V RHE considering the anodic overpotential and Ohmic loss in PEMFC 38 ). To identify whether the enhanced stability is attributed to a possible artefact originating from the operando agglomeration of isolated Pt sites into ORR-active particles, the Fe 0.5 NC–Pt cathode was separated from the membrane–electrode assembly (MEA) after the test and post-mortem characterized. In the HAADF-STEM image, no discernible changes were observed in the atomic distribution of the Pt species after 50 h of PEMFC operation (e ). In addition, the FT- and WT-EXAFS plots for the aged Fe 0.5 NC–Pt revealed a dominant Pt–N interaction, without a perceptible signal from Pt–Pt interaction (f and Supplementary ), almost identical to that for the pristine Fe 0.5 NC–Pt. More evidently, the aged Fe 0.5 NC–Pt recorded a PRR onset potential of 0.81 V RHE, which is much lower than that of Pt/C (0.92 V RHE ) and pristine Fe 0.5 NC–Pt and Fe 0.5 NC (0.83 V RHE ), and similar to that of aged Fe 0.5 NC (0.81 V RHE ; g ). The results therefore indicated no formation of highly active Pt nanoclusters and particles during PEMFC operation. In addition, it can be safely ruled out that Pt single atoms could lead to improved stability by acting as peroxide scavengers (Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary ). Therefore, the fundamental origin of the enhanced stability of PEMFC with Fe 0.5 NC–Pt cathode is unveiled as isolated Pt-induced stabilization of catalytic Fe–N 4 sites against demetallation. Finally, even though a noble element Pt is used and the Pt-modified catalyst is not optimized in the present study, this proof-of-concept study validates that various synthetic approaches can be established to avoid Fe demetallation of active Fe–N 4 sites, a critical degradation path dominating a rapid performance drop during the initial PEMFC operation. Conclusions In this work, we quantitatively resolve the two key phenomena behind the rapid performance loss of Fe–N–C cathodes at an early stage of PEMFC operation. A time- and potential-resolved diagnosis, enabled by the online GDE/EFC/ICP–MS system, elucidates the strong dependence of Fe leaching from active Fe–N 4 moieties on operating variables, such as temperature and gas atmosphere. The former triggers Fe dissolution and determines its total amount, whereas the latter yields different fates of dissolved Fe ions. In addition, this operando study further enables differentiation of a real-time modification of SD and TOF values from the apparent ORR activity drop, a lifetime-dependent stability diagram that presents a clear shift of a prime deactivation path from SD loss to TOF decrease under realistic PEMFC operating conditions. Finally, we conclude that Fe demetallation is a crucial phenomenon responsible for the rapid performance drop observed during the first few hours of PEMFC operation. We show that prohibiting undesirable Fe demetallation and consequently enhancing PEMFC stability are synthetically available by introducing site-isolated Pt ions onto the Fe–N–C catalyst, the concept inspired by previous works and our DFT calculations. Therefore, this understanding suggests that the development of synthetic routes involving non-PGM stabilizers of Fe–N 4 sites could bring hope for the future reality of Fe–N–C catalysts for commercial PEMFCs. Methods Catalyst synthesis Fe 0.5 NC catalyst was prepared from Fe II acetate (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen; ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Zn II zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8, Basolite Z1200, BASF). One gram of the precursor mixture containing 0.5 wt% Fe and a mass ratio of phen/ZIF-8 of 20/80 were mixed using dry ball-milling for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm. A ZrO 2 crucible with 100 ZrO 2 balls of 5 mm diameter was used in this procedure. The resulting precursors were pyrolysed at 1,323 K under Ar flow for 1 h. Fe 0.5 NC contained Fe content of ca. 1.5 wt%, as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES). For the synthesis of Fe 0.5 NC–Pt, 0.5 wt% Pt was impregnated on Fe 0.5 NC by conventional wet impregnation and subsequent H 2 reduction. 0.1 g Fe 0.5 NC was dissolved and dispersed in 100 ml of de-ionized water containing 1.3 mg of H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O (≥37.5%, Pt basis, Merck), and then the solvent was evaporated at 353 K. The resultant powder sample was dried at 353 K under vacuum overnight and reduced at 523 K for 3 h under H 2 flow (5%, 200 ml min −1 ). Commercial Pt nanoparticle (HiSPEC 3000, 20 wt% Pt) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. For the synthesis of Fe 2 O 3 /NC, the NC catalyst was first prepared identically to Fe 0.5 NC, except for the addition of Fe II acetate during the ball-milling step. Note that owing to the presence of trace amounts of Fe impurities in the commercial ZIF-8 (>100 ppm) ( ), Fe-free ZIF-8 was used for the synthesis of NC, which was prepared by mixing 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Zn nitrate hexahydrate (Zn salt; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) in aqueous solution (Zn salt/2-MeIm/water molar ratio of 1/60/2228) ( ). Afterwards, Fe 2 O 3 /NC was synthesized by a dry ball-milling of 98 mg NC and 2 mg commercial Fe 2 O 3 (96%, Sigma-Aldrich) for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm without heat treatment. The Fe content in Fe 2 O 3 /NC was ca. 1.3 wt%, as confirmed by ICP–OES. Commercial Fe–N–C catalyst (no. PMF-0110904, Pajarito Powder) was purchased from Pajarito Powder Inc, which is synthesized via hard templating with fumed silica. The carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported Fe-N-C catalyst (FeNC/CNT) was synthesized using a silica-protective-layer-assisted approach 41 . Then 100 mg of nitric acid-treated CNTs (Carbon Nanomaterial Technology) were mixed with 200 mg of Fe III TMPPCl (Porphyrin Systems) in an agate mortar for 5 min. The mixture was heated in a quartz-tube furnace, starting from room temperature to 673 K, at a ramping rate of 275 K min −1 and kept at that temperature for 3 h under N 2 gas (99.999%) flowing at a rate of 1 l min −1 . Afterwards, the heat-treated CNT/Fe III TMPPCl composite was mixed with 0.5 ml of TEOS in a mortar, followed by mixing with 0.5 ml of formic acid. The resulting mixture was transferred to an alumina crucible and dried in a 333 K oven for 3 h. Subsequently, the composite was heated to 1,073 K at a ramping rate of 275 K min −1 and maintained at that temperature for 3 h under N 2 gas flowing at a rate of 1 l min −1 . To etch the silica, the resulting composite was mixed with 2:1 (v/v) solution of ethanol and 10% aqueous HF, and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was then filtered and washed with ethanol multiple times. The HF etching process was repeated following the same procedure, and the resulting sample was dried at 333 K to obtain FeNC/CNT samples. Physicochemical"

                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41929-024-01133-4_synthesis, Preparation of TiNS TiNS were synthesized by solid-state calcination of TiO 2 :K 2 CO 3 :LiCO 3 in a mole ratio of 1.0:0.23:0.078 according to previously reported procedures 45 . The mixed powder was finely ground for 30 min and calcined in two steps: heating at 900°C for 1 h and gentle grinding after natural cooling to room temperature, and heating at 1,000°C for 20 h and natural cooling to room temperature. In both calcination steps, the temperature rose at 10°C min − 1 to reach the set point. The obtained layered parent microcrystals were washed three times with hot water to remove unreacted K 2 CO 3 and LiCO 3 . The washed K 0.8 Ti 1.73 Li 0.27 O 4 layered oxide was protonated by soaking in HCl solution (0.5 M) at room temperature for 3 days, and the solution was replaced daily with a fresh batch. To produce TiNS, the protonated titanate crystals (H 1.0 Ti 1.73 O 4 ) were dispersed in an aqueous solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) and then shaken gently for 2 days. The molar ratio between TMAOH and the protonated solid was 1:1, and the solid-to-solution ratio was controlled at 4.0 mg ml − 1 . To avoid the deleterious impact of TMAOH molecules in electrocatalytic applications, TiNS was purified by adding an appropriate amount of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 (0.5 M). Then, the suspension was separated by centrifugation for 30 min at 1,610 g at room temperature. The supernatant containing TMA + NO 3 − was discarded, and TiNS was collected as a precipitate. The precipitate was re-suspended in HCl (1 M) and sonicated for 30 min, to convert residual Mg(OH) 2 into MgCl 2 and remove it with the supernatant after centrifugation (2,862 g ). Finally, TiNS was dispersed in EG by a simple shaking process. Preparation of Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS TiNS loaded with Ru and Pt (denoted as Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS, respectively) were prepared by a modified polyol method. An appropriate amount of RuCl 3 or H 2 PtCl 6 precursor was added to isolated TiNS to reach 25 wt.% Ru or 20 wt.% Pt. Typically, TiNS (200 mg) was first dispersed in EG (50 ml) by shaking. Then, the Ru precursor solution (103.13 mg RuCl 3 · x H 2 O dissolved in 10 ml deionized water, equivalent to 50.25 mg of Ru) was added dropwise to TiNS dispersed in EG. In the case of Pt@TiNS, the Pt precursor solution (107.92 mg H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O dissolved in 10 ml deionized water, equivalent to 40.63 mg of Pt) was added dropwise to 200 mg TiNS dispersed in EG. The end product was heated for 3 h at 190°C in an N 2 environment. The final step involved centrifuging Ru@TiNS or Pt@TiNS after washing them three times in acetone. For comparison, Ru (or Pt) loaded onto TiO 2 nanoparticles (TiO 2 -NP) was synthesized with the same procedure but replacing TiNS with TiO 2 . Preparation of the catalyst ink and working electrode To study the electrocatalytic performance, a uniform ink dispersion was prepared by sonicating 2.0 mg of the electrocatalyst in 0.95 ml ethanol and 0.05 ml Nafion solution (5 wt.%) for 30 min, followed by stirring for 10 h. The obtained ink was sprayed onto the surface (1.5 cm 2 ) of a clean carbon paper (CP) on a hotplate at 120°C. The catalyst loading was accurately measured by weighting the CP with a microbalance with and without the electrocatalyst. The catalyst inks were sprayed onto one side of CP at a weight density of 1 mg cm − 2 . Considering that the electrocatalyst contained 25 wt.% of Ru or 20 wt.% of Pt, the Ru or Pt mass density was about 0.25 and 0.2 mg cm − 2 , respectively. Preparation of perovskite-based photocathode ITO/glass substrates were treated with UV/ozone for 30 min and then transferred to a N 2 -filled glovebox with both H 2 O and O 2 levels below 0.1 ppm. A PTAA solution (2 mg ml − 1 in toluene) was spin-cast at 4,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 100°C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, a PFN-Br solution (0.5 mg ml − 1 in methanol) was deposited onto the PTAA films. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving caesium iodide (CsI; 0.06 M), formamidinium iodide (FAI; 1 M), methylammonium bromide (MABr; 0.2 M), lead iodide (PbI 2 ; 1.1 M), lead bromide (PbBr 2 ; 0.2 M) and oleylamine (0.1 wt.%) in 1 ml of dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvent (4/1, v/v). The perovskite layer was deposited using a two-step spin-coating procedure at 1,000 rpm for 5 s and then 5,000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 150 µl of chlorobenzene as an antisolvent was quickly dropped on the centre 10 s before the end of the whole spinning process. The film was annealed at 100°C for 30 min. The perovskite film was coated with PMMA (1 mg ml − 1 in ethyl acetate) and spun at 5,000 rpm before being heated at 100°C for 5 min. The electron transporting layer was deposited by spin-casting a PC 61 BM solution (25 mg ml − 1 in chlorobenzene) at 1,000 rpm for 30 s and a BCP solution (1 mg ml − 1 in isopropyl alcohol) at 4,000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 150-nm-thick Ag electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation at <10 − 6 Torr. Ru@TiNS was sprayed on a piece of CP. After drying, the Ru@TiNS loaded on CP was connected to the Ni foil (0.6 cm × 0.6 cm, thickness ~0.1 mm, Alfa Aesar) with the silver (Ag) paste. This configuration was then attached to the Ag layer (top electrode of the perovskite solar cell) using FM, where it was melted at its melting point (62°C), followed by cooling to room temperature according to a previous report 28 . The edges were then covered with epoxy resin. Finally, to complete the fabrication, small, enamelled piece of copper wire was connected to the samples via Ag paste, leaving them for at least 24 h to dry completely. Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NITRR) All NITRR experiments were performed in a three-electrode H-cell configuration, with constant stirring at 500 rpm in both compartments. CP with sprayed catalyst ink was used as the working electrode; Hg/HgO or Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in alkaline or acidic medium, respectively; and a piece of clean Pt wire as the CE. The applied potential was expressed relative to the RHE using the following equation for conversion: $$E,{V}_{{{\\mathrm{RHE}}}}=E,{V}_{\\frac{{{\\mathrm{Hg}}}}{{{\\mathrm{HgO}}}}}\\left({{\\mathrm{or}}\\; E},{V}_{\\frac{{{\\mathrm{Ag}}}}{{{\\mathrm{AgCl}}}}}\\right)+0.59\\,{{\\mathrm{pH}}}.$$ The two compartments in the H-cell were separated by a Nafion membrane. The concentrations of NH 3 and NO 2 − were measured periodically in the anolyte part to check product diffusion from the catholyte to the anolyte cell. When needed, a replenishment system was utilized to supply fresh NO 3 − electrolyte solution in the catholyte compartment. In the experiments, the H-cell was filled with 50 ml electrolyte solution in each half, and the system was connected online to the gas chromatograph to analyse the HER. It was also equipped with a sealed syringe to enable online sampling and measurement of NH 3 and NO 2 − concentrations (using the indophenol blue and Griess reagent protocols, respectively; Supplementary ). The FE for NH 3 and NO 2 − and the current density for NH 3 were calculated as follows: $${{{\\mathrm{FE}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{NH}}}3}=\\frac{\\left(8\\times F\\times {C}_{{{\\mathrm{NH}}}3}\\times V\\,\\right)}{Q}$$ $${{{\\mathrm{FE}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{NO}}}2}=\\frac{\\left(2\\times F\\times {C}_{{{\\mathrm{NO}}}2}\\times V\\,\\right)}{Q}$$ $${{{\\mathrm{FE}}}}_{{\\mathrm{H}}2}=\\frac{\\left(2\\times F\\times {C}_{{\\mathrm{H}}2}\\times V\\,\\right)}{Q}$$ where F is the Faraday constant, V is the volume of the electrolyte, Q is the transferred charge in the electrocatalytic reaction, C NH3 and C NO2 are respectively the molar concentrations of NH 3 and nitrite, m is the catalyst mass and t is the reaction time. Furthermore, the onset potential, which we define here to mean to the voltage at which 0.5 mA cm − 2 is reached. Electrochemical glycerol oxidation In the electrochemical glycerol oxidation experiment, Pt@TiNS sprayed on CP (loading: 1 mg cm − 2 ) was used as the working electrode, Pt wire as the CE, and Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. A two-compartment cell was filled with 50 ml of 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M glycerol as electrolyte on each side. The product concentration and selectivity were measured by a Waters 2535 high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with UV and refractive index detectors and a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H sugar column. PEC measurement PEC measurements were performed on each individual photocathode utilizing a half-cell reactor in 1.0 M KOH with various KNO 3 concentrations in a conventional three-electrode system. The working, reference and counter electrodes were integrated perovskite photocathode, Hg/HgO (1.0 M NaOH), and Pt mesh (1 cm × 1 cm). All potentials were measured against the Hg/HgO reference electrode and converted to the RHE reference scale using the equation E ( V versus RHE) = E ( V versus Hg/HgO) + 0.059 × pH + 0.118. For the unassisted measurement system, PEC tests were performed to reveal the long-term stability and concentration of formed products using 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M KNO 3 (50 ml) as the catholyte and 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M glycerol (50 ml) as the anolyte. The home-made glass reactor was used to conduct the unassisted experiments. A Nafion 117 membrane that had been pre-activated by soaking in deionized water for 2 h divided this two-compartment reactor in the middle. The geometric area of the photocathodes was used to normalize all current densities, and a 10 mV s − 1 scan rate was maintained. The simulated AM 1.5 G one-sun irradiation was achieved by using a water filter and a 300 W xenon lamp. By aligning a silicon reference cell (approved by Newport Corporation; PEC-SI01, Peccell Technologies) parallel to the light beam from the xenon lamp, the light intensity was adjusted on the ITO side (backside illumination) to one sun. The device was covered by black tape except for an aperture area of 0.096 cm 2 , which determined the illumination area. The absorbance measurements were conducted on a UV–Vis spectrometer (Agilent Cary 5000). The thickness of the PMMA layer was measured by first depositing the layer on thin ITO glass and then conducting ellipsometry (Elli-SE-UaM8). Indophenol blue method UV–Vis spectroscopy was utilized to measure NH 3 concentration by the indophenol blue method 29 , 37 , 46 . The samples were collected through the gas-sealed syringe line and diluted enough to be within detectable range. Then, into 1 ml mixed solution containing 1 M NaOH, 5 wt.% salicylic acid and 5 wt.% sodium citrate, 1 ml of diluted sample was added. In the next step, 0.5 ml NaClO (0.05 M) was added and mixed by pipetting method. Finally, 0.1 ml sodium nitroferricyanide solution (1.0 wt.%) was added, mixed and kept for 1 h under dark before UV–Vis spectrophotometry measurement. The peak absorbance at 655 nm was recorded, and the NH 3 concentration was calculated by calibration curve obtained using NH 4 Cl solutions (Supplementary a,b ). The NH 3 concentration was also measured by 1 H-NMR (500 MHz) according to a previous reported procedure 46 . The sample was diluted to the detection range and mixed with 0.1 ml DMSO, and its NMR spectrum was acquired on a Liquid Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer. The NH 3 concentration was evaluated using a standard calibration curve (Supplementary ). Nitrite detection The nitrite concentration was measured using a spectroscopy procedure reported elsewhere 29 . p -Aminobenzenesulfonamide (2.0 g) was dissolved in 50 ml deionized water. Another solution was prepared by mixing ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.1 g) and phosphoric acid (3.94 ml) in 50 ml deionized water. Both solutions were stored in the refrigerator and mixed in 1:1 volume ratio (colouring agent) just before the UV–Vis measurement. Then, 1.0 ml of the collected sample was diluted to reach the detection range, and 2.0 ml H 2 SO 4 (0.5 M) was added and finally 1.0 ml of the above prepared colouring agent. By using UV–Vis spectrophotometry, the intensity of the spectral peak at 540 nm was determined (UV-2600). A calibration curve was used to determine the concentration (Supplementary c,d ). Isotopically labelled ammonia ( 15 NH 3 ) detection To exclude the possibility of NH 3 detection by another source of contaminations (N 2 reduction reaction, electrode contamination or NH 3 injection through gas line or in air) isotopically labelled K 15 NO 3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 atom% 15 N) was utilized as N-source and the corresponding 15 NH 3 + was quantified by 15 NH 3 + (Agilent (Varian) VNMRS-600MHz spectrometer). Due to the clear identification of 15 NH 3 + with doublet 15 NH 3 + from triplet peaks of 14 NH 3 + , overestimation of NH 3 concentration and consequently FE, percentage can be cancelled effectively. Isotopically labelled experiments were conducted for both electrocatalytic and PEC conversion of K 15 NO 3 to 15 NH 4 + . The sample was taken from electrolyte at different time after starting reaction and then acidified to pH 3 by adding appropriate 3 M HCl. The sample then mixed with 0.1 ml DMSO, and its 1 H-NMR spectrum was obtained. The 15 NH 4 + concentration was quantified based on the calibration curve acquired by a set of 15 NH 4 Cl (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 atom% 15 N) standard solutions (Supplementary ). Anolyte product quantification A certain amount of aliquot was analysed after each experiment using HPLC to calculate selectivity of the products via an Agilent 1260 infinity 2 chromatography equipped with a Hi-Plex H (7.7 × 300 mm, 8 μm) column. The selectivity of products was calculated by the following equation: $${{\\mathrm{Selectivity}}}=\\frac{{N}_{{\\mathrm{D}}}}{{N}_{{\\mathrm{T}}}}\\times 100$$ $${\\rm{Yield}}, \\% =\\frac{{N}_{{\\mathrm{D}}}}{{a\\times N}_{{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\times 100$$ where N T is the total sum of desired and undesired products, N i is the initial concentration of glycerol and N D is the desired product. For its quantification, the standard calibration curve was plotted on the basis of the concentration and integrated area in HPLC. Here the solvent for standard solution was H 2 SO 4 with proper concentration recommended for column."

The as-synthesized 2 mg photocatalyst ( Ni 5W10/Ni6W10) was dispersed in a mixed solution of 1 ml ethanol and 10 μL Nafion D-520 dispersion solutions. The mixture was sonicated for a while to generate a homogeneous suspension. Subsequently, 200 μL of suspensions was transferred and unifor mly covers on ITO glass plates (1 cm × 2 cm) via a simple drop-coating, then dried at room temperature. Mott-Schottky plot measurements. The Mott-Schottky plots were measured over an alternating current (AC) frequency of 500 Hz, 1,500 Hz and 2,500 Hz. The experime nts were performed with an SP-150 electrochemical workstation via a conven tional three-electrode system in a 0.5 M Na 2SO 4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.8). The Ag / AgCl electrode was employed as the respectively. Photocurrent measurements. Photoelectrochemical measurements were si milar to Mott-Schottky measurement with CHI 660e electrochemical workstation in a standard three-electr ode electrochemical cell with a working electrode, a platinum pl ate as counter electr ode and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode . The detailed preparation of working electrodes was in line with the above experiments. A Xe non light with UV-Vis spectra (λ = 350 - 780 nm) was applied as the light source for Photocurrent, and 0.5 M Na 2SO 4 aqueous solution was used as the elect rolyte. During the photoelectrochemical measurements, the distance between th e light source and three-electrode electrochemical cell was about 20 cm, and a -5 .0 mV bias potential was applied for the testing of photocurrent-time (I-t) curves. When the background current was stabilized, the working electrode was illuminated for 20s (light on) and then the light source was shielded for 20s (light off) , repeated the above operation and recorded the photocurrent- time (I-t) curves through the electrochemi cal workstation, and finally obtained the photocurrent curve.

The scan range is between -1.5 V to 1.0 V. A ll experiments were run at a scan rate of 50 mV s-1 in an acetonitrile containing 2 mM substrate and 0.1 M electrolyte, unless otherwise noted. Supplementary Note 5: Detailed Procedures of Photocatalytic and Triple Tandem Reaction experiments. General Procedure for Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction Experiments. The photocatalytic CO 2RR was carried out in a 25 mL qua rtz reactor at a temperature of 25°C maintained by using a circulating-water bath to en sure constant temperature. These crystalline catalysts were milled into pow ders using an agate mortar, catalyst (5 mg) and [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2·6H 2O (0.027 mmol) were added into the mixed solution which contained acetonitrile (4 mL), TEOA (1 mL, 7.5 mmol) and deionized water (200 μL) and dispersed by constant magnetic stirring in solution. The reaction system was saturated by CO 2 for 15 min at 1 atm CO 2 partial pressure and th en irradiated using a Xenon lamp (350nm - 780 nm, 300 W). The typi cal test is 8 hours. The gas products in the headspace of the reactor were measured using GC with an FID detector to analyze CO/CH 4/CO 2 and a TCD detector to analyze H 2. Tandem selective hydrogenation reaction (one pot method). All reactions were done in only one cham ber (A chamber). The photocatalytic CO reduction experiment was prep ared according to the above general procedure, then addition of different amounts (0.01-0.1 mmol) of alkyne organics before the end of filling with CO 2 gas. The mixed solution wa s irradiated under vi sible light for 8 h. The reaction product was detected and quantifie d by mass spectromet ry (5977B Agilent Technologies), and NMR analysis after pu rification by column chromatography on silica gel. The gas products were measured us ing GC with an FID detector to analyze CO/CH 4/CO 2 and a TCD detector to analyze H 2. Triple Tandem Reaction Experiments (dual-chamber method). These experiments were performed in two- chamber system. All organic measurements were carried out under equivalent experiment al conditions. Achieving high gas density in the reaction volume, the relatively small volume of the chamber reactor (Schlenk tube) was selected (A chamber, 25 mL a nd B chamber, 10 mL). chamber A was used for tandem selective hydrogenation reaction acco rding to the protocol above (substrate: 5 μL phenylacetylene). The reaction conditions in chamber B was loaded with aryl iodide (0.1 mmol), Pd(PPh 3)4 (0.025 mmol), Et 3N (139.0 μL, 1.0 mmol), and the corresponding terminal alkyne or amine or aryl boronic ac id (0.2 mmol). Subsequently, anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (3 mL) was added to the reactor. The two chambers were chained together by a short linker, all joints were in a closed stat e. Subsequently, only open the joint of B, and the B chamber was then flash froze n at 77 K (liquid N 2 bath) and degassed by three freeze-pump-thaw cycles, and evacuated to an internal pressure of ~100 mTorr. Then warm to room temperature, A chamber was placed under photocatalytic conditions, the B chamber was placed in an oil bath. After 8h photocatalytic reacting, inject ions of 5.2 mL MeCN was made in A chamber to increase the density of the gas in the container. S ubsequently, A’s joint was slowly opened and B chamber was stirred at 65°C for 16 h in the oil bath. The reaction product was detected and quantified by mass spectrome try (5977B Agilent Technologies) and NMR analysis after purifica tion by column chromat ography on silica gel. Supplementary Note 6: Computational details Calculation of exciton binding energy. In order to further verify the efficiency of exciton separation (or charge separation) in Ni 5 cluster and Ni5W10, we calculated the Coulomb attr action energies (Ec) between electrons and holes in 5 excited states (S1- S5). A smaller Ec value typically indicates a higher exciton separation efficiency. In this study, Geometry optimization and of all of the investigated gases a nd clusters was conducted using the density func tional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functiona l theory (TD-DFT) method at the B3LYP- GD3(BJ)/6-311G* level of theory and was accomplished with the aid of the Gaussian 16 software program 4. B3LYP-GD3(BJ), which is an exchange–correlation functional with the D3 version of Grimme’s dispersion correction encompassing the famous Becke-Johnson damping was utilized for this study as it serves best for accurately predicting weak interactions and also mostly applied for adsorption studies as seen in reported works of several authors5,6. We also used Multiwfn 3.8 to perform an electron- hole analysis7. Calculation of catalytic reactions. All the calculations of catalytic reactions are performed within the framework of DFT implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (V ASP)8-10. The generalized gradient approximation with the functi onal is described by the Perdew-Burke- Ernzerhof type (PBE)11. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method12-14 is applied to describe the wavefunctions in the core regions, while the valence wavefunctions are expanded as linear combinati on of plane-waves with a cu toff energy of 400 eV . The total energy is converged to 10-5 eV in the geometry optimizations, and the Hellmann– Feynman force on each relaxed atom is less than 0.02 eV/Å. Photocatalytic CO 2RR Process: In the first part, the Gi bbs reaction free energy of reaction for CO 2RR and HER of elemen tary steps involving (H+ + e–) pair transfer was calculated using computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model15. At U=0 V , ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + CPdT, where ΔE is the reaction energy difference between the product and reactant of the CO 2RR occurring on catalysts, which can be directly obtained from DFT computations; ΔEZPE, TΔS and CpdT are zero-point energy correction, entropy correction and enthal pic temperature correction at T=298.15 K respectively, which were calculated from the vibrational frequencies. The ΔEZPE, TΔS and CpdT for each reaction intermediates can be calculated by the following equations, respectively: 2ZPE i iE hv = 1ln(1 ) ( ) 1i B i Bhv KT Bi hv ii KTTS K T e hv e− −= − − − 1() 1i Bpi hv i KTCd T h v e= − where h, v and KB are Planck constant, vibrational frequencies and Boltzmann constant, respectively.

C. 2020, 124, 31, The second part of the calculation involve s the dynamic process of H transfer. To compare the kinetic energy barriers of the H+ transfers from the solvent to either the Ni site for HER or the C sites for the reducti on of alkynes, all elementary steps were calculated using the c limbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) approach16. The minimum energy path was examined using 8 images, including th e initial and final state, during the transition st ate search. we applied a hybrid explicit-impli cit approach to simulate the solvation effect. Specifi cally, we place a water network consisting of four water molecules on top the Ni site to construct a metal-solvent interface and to stabilize the H + in the solvent. We then use the implicit model to account for long range solvation effect and neutralizes the char ged ions, which is essential for periodic calculations, it presents the merits of a low computational cost and qualitatively accurate results. the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) as implement in V ASP (V ASPsol) is applied14. To validate our model, we compare the energy barriers for the V olmer and Heyrovsky steps with other system s and the results are in the reasonable range. It can be noted that the V olmer step is often in lower in energy comparing with the Heyrovsky step. The former step can be mainly contributed by the breaking of the hydrogen bonding of the proton in the water network (-0.31 eV)17,18. Only the entry 1 is calculated for the whole process and we assume the re action mechanism can be also applied to other systems. Supplementary Note 7: Ph otophysical experiments. Photoluminescent (PL) que nching experiments. The excitation wavelength was 400 nm when steady-state PL was measured using Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer. All of the solution systems were bubbled with CO 2 for 15 min to dissolve oxygen and maintain saturated conditions. At the end of ventilation, To probe the fluor escence quenching of [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2·6H 2O by Ni 5W10 / Ni6W10 catalysts or organic substrates, the photoluminescent quenching measurements were performed in MeCN / H 2O (20:1, 10 mL) mixed so lution containing 0.02 mM [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2·6H 2O. The steady-state PL spectra of a mixed solution containing [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2·6H 2O were performed upon the addi tion of increasing amounts of catalysts (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg) or phenylacetylene (0.00, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00 mM). Fluorescence intensity was then evaluated. Photoluminescence lifet ime experiments. The samples were excited by the incident li ght of 390 nm and the PL decay spectra at 605 nm were monitored using PICOQuant FT-300 spectrofluorometer. These solution systems were bubbled with CO 2 for 15 min to dissolve oxygen and maintain saturated conditions. The mixed solution contained aceto nitrile and deionized water (20:1). Then [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2·6H 2O (0.02 mM) was dissolved in 10 mL of the abovementioned mixed solution. Finally, 5 mg catalyst or 5 μL phenylacetylene was added and the solution underwent ultrasonication to disperse the catalyst uniformly. Photoluminescence lifetimes were tested subsequently. Supplementary Note 8: XPS measurements. First, these crystalline catalysts ( Ni5W10 and Ni6W10) were ground into powder and activated at 100 ℃ under vacuum. Second, the catalys t was mixed and stirred with MeCN solution containing phenylacetylene (100 μL/mL) for adsorption. The sample was collected by centrifugation and dried at 25 ℃ under vacuum for 24 h. Final, the resultant sample was used for XPS measurements19. In our work, the adsorption free energies of phenylacetylene on catalysts we re -0.65 eV or -0.73 eV , which mean that the chemisorption was a spontaneous proces s. Meanwhile, the XPS"

To further experimentally demonstrate th e critical role of CDs -induced confined pyrolysis towards high N -dopants , we conducted control experiments based on a two- stage technology . In the first stage, urea undergoes condensation to form g -C3N4. In the second stage , mixtures of CDs, NiCl 2 and thiourea are pyrolyzed to obtain carbon -based materials. As such, the bonding interactions between g -C3N4 and CDs -constructed carbon support are avoided. Remarkably, the typical out-of-plane sp3 C-N (located at ca. 286.5 eV) bonding bahevior8,9 is observed during the preparation of UHDNi –N–C SACs . However, in stark contrast, the sp3 C–N bond ing behavior is absent in the two - stage pyrolysis process ( as expected ). Benefiting from this , the total N content of the products obtained after 800 oC in the two-stage pyrolysis is as low as 8.0 at%, which is only 30.7 % of the value for UHDNi –N–C SACs (26.1 at%) .

Two typical reaction pathways are shown for the synthesis of C 2+ products: the CO 2 -modified Fischer–Tropsch pathway and the methanol-mediated pathway. SMSI, strong metal–support interaction; RWGS, reverse water–gas shift; CO-Hydro, CO hydrogenation, also named Fischer–Tropsch synthesis; OX-ZEO, metal oxides and zeolites. Yellow, O in the support; aqua, metal in the support; blue, metal active sites; green in the catalyst model, metal active sites affected by MSIs; dark blue in ZEO, Si; grey in ZEO, Al. Full size image The reaction pathways for C 1 products (CO, CH 4 , CH 3 OH and HCOOH) are well established compared to those for C 2+ products ( ). Generally, there are two main reaction intermediates, carbon monoxide (*CO) and formate (*HCOO). *CO can be produced from the reverse water–gas shift (RWGS, CO 2 hydrogenation to CO and H 2 O) process or CO 2 dissociation via direct C–O bond cleavage. The resulting *CO is hydrogenated to form the final products. Thus, the three reaction pathways for C 1 products are the RWGS + CO-Hydro (CO hydrogenation, also named Fischer–Tropsch synthesis) pathway, the direct C–O bond cleavage pathway and the formate pathway. If *CO or *HCOOH adsorption is weak, further hydrogenation could be inhibited, and these products can desorb from the catalyst surface to produce CO or HCOOH. Methane and methanol synthesis are proposed to involve at least four or three reaction pathways, respectively. The key determinant for the formation of CH 4 or methanol is dissociation of the second C–O bond, as the formation of CH 4 requires this dissociation. Therefore, efficient activation of the C–O bond at low reaction temperatures is essential when designing catalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation. For C 2+ products (such as light olefins, dimethyl ether, ethanol and gasoline), the typical reaction pathways are the methanol-mediated route with a hydrocarbon-pool mechanism or the CO 2 -modified Fischer–Tropsch route over bifunctional catalysts. Bifunctional catalysts contain Zn/In/Cu-based metal oxides or Fe-based metal oxides and zeolites (OX-ZEO). The metal oxides catalyse reactants to form methanol or *CO intermediates, which then further react to form C 2+ products via oligomerization, isomerization and aromatization steps over the zeolites. Therefore, although OX-ZEO catalysts can catalyse either route, different zeolites (HZSM-5 and SAPO-34) present different reaction pathways for the synthesis of different C 2+ products. For instance, ZnZrO/SAPO-34 generates 80.0% light olefins and ZnZrO/HZSM-5 generates 80.3% C 5+ products by CO 2 hydrogenation with the same methanol-mediated route ( , bottom), but with a different hydrocarbon-pool mechanism over the zeolites 9 , 10 . The Na-Fe 3 O 4 /HZSM-5 catalyst achieves 79.4% C 5+ products, but via the CO 2 -modified Fischer–Tropsch route ( , top) 11 . To control C 2+ -product selectivity, C–O activation and C–C coupling need to be regulated. Furthermore, *(CH 2 ) n and *CH x O intermediate adsorption and desorption over bifunctional catalysts are affected by the metal-oxide species, the porous structure and Brønsted acids of the zeolites, as well as proximity effects, demonstrating the effects of different combinations of multifunctional active sites on product distributions. Design principles for catalysts to vary selectivity The results of CO 2 hydrogenation performance testing (including CO 2 conversion, product selectivity and the main reaction conditions) for some representative studies on the design of catalysts to improve selectivity are summarized in Table 1 . These results indicate that CO 2 hydrogenation product selectivity is affected by a range of parameters, which are analysed with examples in the following. Specific principles for the tuning of product selectivity are proposed, including via chemical states, particle sizes, crystal facets, synergistic effects and unique structures for catalyst design. Table 1 Summary of product selectivity for CO 2 hydrogenation based on different catalyst design principles. Full size table Chemical states Transition metals are often the main active components of CO 2 hydrogenation catalysts, so product selectivity can be regulated by the design of the metal sites. Both the geometric and electronic structures of metals determine product distributions. Accordingly, we will first look at the effect of chemical states on tuning reaction selectivity. This is an inherent catalytic property of metals that is independent of external operating conditions. For example, Ni and Ru have high activity for CO 2 methanation (CO 2 hydrogenation to CH 4 ), whereas Cu and In tend to hydrogenate CO 2 to CO or methanol. Fe is usually used for the synthesis of light olefins and liquid fuels. However, product selectivity also varies greatly over the same metal-based catalysts when the geometric properties of the metals are adjusted. With transition-metal catalysts, before the CO 2 hydrogenation reaction, in situ reduction under a H 2 atmosphere is used to ‘activate’ the catalysts. As the chemical state of the active sites affects product selectivity, one area of focus is catalyst pretreatment methods. The formal valence states of the metals greatly affect selectivity (a ) 12 . The adsorption strength of CO on the metal centre is key, as the metal d orbitals donate electrons to the π * orbital of CO, which affects CO adsorption. Aitbekova and colleagues used oxygen to treat metallic Ru nanoparticles (NPs) supported on CeO 2 to generate a single-site RuO x /CeO 2 -ox catalyst, and the reaction pathways over the catalyst were altered, resulting in a switch in the reaction selectivity from CH 4 to CO (b and Table 1 ) 13 . This difference in selectivity is a consequence of the oxygen redispersing the initial Ru NPs into atomically dispersed RuO x species with weaker CO adsorption ability, which favours CO desorption. Metallic and oxidized Co components supported on Al 2 O 3 or TiO 2 can produce different products, with the oxidized CoO/TiO 2 -ox producing more CH 4 (~60%) and the metallic Co/TiO 2 -red producing more CO. The partial encapsulation of metallic Co by TiO 2− x via strong metal–support interactions (SMSIs, an interaction that is usually observed between metal NPs and reducible supports) 14 weakens the hydrogenation ability of Co/TiO 2 -red to produce more CO 12 . Oxidized CoO/TiO 2 -ox has also been reported to be more favourable for C 2+ synthesis (11%) via the hydrogen-assisted CO 2 activation pathway, whereas the metallic Co/TiO 2 -red favours the direct dissociation pathway (b ) 15 . : Chemical states of metals involved in regulating CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity. a , Gas (O 2 or H 2 )-treated Ru/CeO 2 or Co/TiO 2 catalysts to redisperse metal particles with different valence states (ox, oxidized; red, reduced), resulting in different selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. b , Catalytic performance of Ru/CeO 2 or Co/TiO 2 catalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation with different product selectivity.

Full size image Studies on the chemical states of Cu/Ni/Zn/Fe/Ce species have been reported 16 . Different metal species with similar particle sizes can influence the adsorption and conversion behaviours of both reactants and intermediates, and thus product selectivity. For instance, Cu exists as Cu 0 , Cu + and Cu 2+ species. There is an interplay between Cu + and Cu 0 . Cu + species are more active for CO 2 adsorption and activation to methanol by stabilization of the *CO intermediates, whereas Cu 0 species are the active sites for H 2 activation 17 . A Ni-doped CeO 2 catalyst with ionic Ni and Ce 3+ instead of metallic Ni as the active site has been reported for high-performance CO 2 methanation 18 . Fe species (such as Fe, Fe 3 O 4 , θ -Fe 3 C and Fe 5 C 2 ) with tunable selectivity have been studied systematically, and Fe 3 O 4 was found to be fully selective for CO synthesis, and θ -Fe 3 C selective for hydrocarbon products (>97%; c and Table 1 ) 19 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the adsorption of *CO intermediates and H 2 dissociation over Fe 3 C species are much stronger than over Fe 3 O 4 , improving the selectivity of the hydrocarbon products. The dynamic behaviour of Fe species revealed during CO 2 hydrogenation offers new insights into the origin of the catalytic activity. Zhu and colleagues reported the correlation between the dynamic structural evolution of Fe species and CO 2 hydrogenation performance, indicating that the formed Fe 5 C 2 -rich surface is favourable for C 2+ selectivity (d and Table 1 ) 20 . Strategies need to be developed for maintaining the active species under reaction atmospheres. Additionally, iron carbides rather than iron nitrides have been shown to be the active sites for the selective synthesis of C 2+ hydrocarbons 21 . For example, when Fe 5 C 2 was introduced to ZnFe 2 O 4 , the product selectivity switched from methanol (99.4%) to C 2+ OH alcohols (98.2% and Table 1 ) 22 . Also, the proximity of ZnFe 2 O 4 and Fe–Zn–Na affects the selectivity of higher alcohols, with the powder-mixing method achieving the highest selectivity for C 2+ OH (Table 1 ). Therefore, understanding the origin of the activity and selectivity as well as the catalyst reconstruction is a key research topic in this field. Particle size Regulating metal particle sizes is an effective strategy to control selectivity. Structure sensitivity is well known in heterogeneous catalysis, and the hydrogenation abilities of single atoms, clusters, small NPs and large NPs differ. Metal particle size can affect CO 2 dissociation as well as the adsorption energies of the reaction intermediates, and methanol synthesis is sensitive to cluster size 23 . Atomically dispersed Zn can improve the selectivity of methanol by suppressing formate decomposition over a Cu–Zn catalyst for CO 2 hydrogenation 24 . Larger Cu NPs are not active for CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol, but single-atom Cu 1 –O 3 units have 100% selectivity towards methanol, and small Cu clusters generate CO (a,b ) 25 . Zhang and colleagues used DFT to examine the effect of Cu NP size on CO 2 hydrogenation activity, finding that intermediate-sized Cu 19 clusters have the optimal CO 2 hydrogenation activity due to a moderate CO 2 coverage and a low CO 2 dissociation barrier. For C 1 products, small clusters and Ni/Ru/Re atomic species are selective for CO, but larger particle sizes of Ni/Ru/Re NPs are selective for CH 4 (refs. 13 , 26 , 27 , 28 ). Compared to smaller Ni NPs, larger Ni NPs with more metallic states facilitate the rate-determining step of H 2 -assisted CO dissociation and therefore enhance CO 2 conversion and CH 4 selectivity 27 . Interestingly, when Ni loading and Ni NP size are precisely controlled 29 , different activity and selectivity over Ni/β-Ga 2 O 3 is observed, with the smaller Ni NPs exhibiting higher activity for the RWGS reaction and the larger Ni NPs favouring hydrogen dissociation for methanol synthesis. A similar metal particle size effect is observed during the synthesis of C 2+ products. Smaller Fe NPs are sensitive to CO production, whereas CH 4 and C 2+ products are more likely to be generated over larger Fe NPs (c,d and Table 1 ) 26 . The main reason for this difference is that larger metal particles with more terrace sites are not only favourable for the formation of *HCOO species, but also exhibit higher chain-growth probability. : Particle size effect of metals on CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity. a , Effect of Cu particle size on CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol over the Cu/ZrO 2 catalyst 25 .

Full size image The correlation between metal particle sizes and CO 2 hydrogenation is still not well established, but it suggests that catalytic performance is sensitive to catalyst structure and should therefore be investigated further. Additionally, the size of the catalyst support should also be studied due to the influence of metal–support interactions (MSIs). For example, CeO 2 supports calcined at different temperatures (450 and 1,000°C) with different particle sizes (15.2 and 191.7 nm) have different MSIs and CO/H adsorption ability, resulting in different selectivity for CO compared with supported Co NPs 30 . The CO selectivity is tuned from 24% over Co/CeO 2 -450 to 49% over Co/CeO 2 -1000 (Table 1 ). C–O activation and C–C coupling processes should be considered from the perspective of the correlation between particle sizes and C 2+ products when designing highly selective catalysts. Crystal facets Product selectivity is also affected by the exposed crystal facets and the crystal phase of the support. The crystal phase can also be transformed during CO 2 hydrogenation, resulting in different reaction rates and product selectivity 31 . The crystal planes of Co 3 O 4 have been shown to influence CO 2 hydrogenation products. Rhombic dodecahedral Co 3 O 4 with {111} and {001} phases shows high selectivity for CH 4 , whereas nanorod Co 3 O 4 with {110} and {001} phases is more selective for CO ( ). This is because Co 3 O 4 {111} can produce more oxygen vacancies that promote the CH 3 O* intermediate dissociation and further hydrogenation. The crystal phases of the support are also important for tuning product selectivity. As shown in , TiO 2 with two different crystal phases used to support Ru or Co catalysts displays distinct CO 2 hydrogenation performances (a,b ). When Ru or Co catalysts are supported on rutile ( r ) TiO 2 they are selective for CH 4 , as shown with 1Ru/ r -TiO 2 and Co/ r -TiO 2 . However, the main product is CO when the reaction is performed over 1Ru/ a -TiO 2 and Co/ a -TiO 2 catalysts ( a , anatase; c and Table 1 ) 33 , 34 . An operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) study indicated that differences in electron transfer from Ru to TiO 2 induced by hydrogen spillover (the surface migration of activated hydrogen atoms from metal active sites onto the catalyst support) influence the adsorption and hydrogenation of the *CO intermediate 35 , resulting in different selectivities. The operando DRIFTS results indicate that Co/TiO 2 catalysts with varying support crystal phases catalyse different reaction pathways; Co/ r -TiO 2 follows the formate pathway and Co/ a -TiO 2 the CO pathway. Accordingly, the product selectivity can be manipulated 34 . In 2 O 3 supported on monoclinic ZrO 2 ( m -ZrO 2 ) is more selective for methanol, whereas In 2 O 3 / t -ZrO 2 ( t , tetragonal) shows relatively high selectivity for CO production (c,d ) 36 . This is because m -ZrO 2 can transfer more electrons to the In–O–In units of In 2 O 3 , enriching the electron density of In 2 O 3 , so the *HCOO intermediates are more easily hydrogenated to methanol. : Crystal facets of supports involved in regulating CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity. a , b , Regulation of the crystal facets of TiO 2 supports to tune CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity over Co or Ru/TiO 2 catalysts, where a represents anatase ( a ) and t represents rutile ( b ). c , Product selectivity of Ru/TiO 2 catalysts with different crystal facets.

Full size image These results demonstrate the importance of engineering crystal phases and planes to determine product selectivity. More extensive studies are needed to control product selectivity by engineering the crystal phases at the molecular level, which is important for obtaining the desired products. Transformation of the crystal phase under reaction conditions should be investigated to reveal the chemical states of the actual active phases. Synergistic effects Synergistic effects impact the electronic states and chemical properties of active sites as well as reaction intermediates. There can also be synergism between single atoms and NPs, interparticle interactions, metal and promoter interactions, as well as MSIs, and these can be used to tune product selectivity ( ) 37 . : Synergistic effects of metal active sites, metals and promoters, and metals and supports for regulating CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity. a , Illustration of tuning of the distance between dual active sites to regulate the synergistic effects of active sites and the hydrogen spillover, and thus product selectivity. b , Synergistic effects of metals and promoters tune the product from CH 4 to CO. c , SMSIs tune the product selectivity from CH 4 to CO. d , e , Corresponding in situ DRIFTS spectra of Rh 1 /ZrO 2 ( d ) and 1Na-Rh 1 /ZrO 2 ( e ), as well as DFT calculation results of CO 2 activation on ZrO 2 and Na-ZrO 2 surfaces.

DFT calculations further demonstrate that the formation of COOH* has a higher energy barrier than that for HCOO*, and the introduction of a Na promoter would decrease the energy barrier for both COOH* and HCOO*.

Full size image Regulating the distance between Cu NPs in a CuZnAl catalyst by controlling the amount of silica has been demonstrated to tune methanol selectivity; this could be increased from 35.5 mol% to 88.9 mol% by increasing the distance 38 . This occurs because the hydrogen spillover is regulated by the distance between the Cu NPs, suppressing the RWGS reaction and thus improving methanol selectivity. This distance effect could be extended to oxide–oxide and alloy systems, and bimetallic catalysts with dual-site distances. Different distances between Co 3 O 4 and ZnO induce different remote hydrogen spillover effects and local interface confinement, allowing tuning of the selectivity ratio between CO and CH 4 as well as the catalyst reactivity (Table 1 ) 39 . Diatomic Ir 1 Pd 1 –In 2 O 3 catalysts with different dual-site distance-dependent synergistic catalysis were designed for CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol. The proximity between diatomic sites could enhance methanol selectivity to 97% under high CO 2 conversion due to rapid hydrogen spillover on the adjacent Pd and Ir sites 40 . Recently, a graphene fencing approach was reported to control multiple active sites of Fe–Co bimetallic alloy catalysts, resulting in different hydrocarbon products 41 . For example, 50.1% light olefin could be produced over Fe–Co active sites on the surface of graphene fences. However, the product changes to 43.6% liquefied petroleum gas over spatial Fe–Co NPs separated by graphene fences. The proximity effect is more obvious in bifunctional catalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation to C 2+ products, as introduced in the next section. Promotion of the main metal catalytic sites (for example, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru and Pd) with other alkali, transition metals (such as Na, K, Cs, Cu and La) and non-metallic promoters (including Si, P and graphene) also alters the reaction selectivity due to modification of the electronic and chemical properties of the catalytic metals (b ) 42 , 43 , 44 . For instance, the steric effect induced by promoters can block some active sites, hindering the adsorption of certain reaction intermediates to reduce the formation of by-products 45 . Furthermore, the electronic effect induced by electron transfer between promoters and primary metals may regulate the electronic properties and therefore the adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates. For example, alkali-ion-modified single-atom Rh 1 /ZrO 2 catalysts can switch reaction selectivity from CH 4 (~100%) to CO (>99%) by changing the surface intermediate from formate to carboxy species (Table 1 ) 46 . Na + promotes stronger electronic Rh–O interactions and enhances CO 2 /*COOH adsorption while suppressing hydrogen activation, resulting in higher CO selectivity (d–f ). Similarly, modifying Ni 3 Zn 1 C 0.7 with K can switch the major product from CH 4 to higher alcohols 47 , and a carbon buffer layer modifies the electronic properties of ZnO x –Fe 5 C 2 –Fe 3 O 4 and can enhance the ethanol yield 48 . Additionally, the promoter effect of phosphine ligands and electron acceptors (such as Bi, In, Sn and halogen elements) can also adjust product selectivity. For instance, Ni/TiO 2 modified by a P promoter and Ru/CeO 2 modified by Bi adjust the selectivity from CH 4 to CO (Table 1 ) 49 , 50 . Bimetallic architectures, from core–shell structures to ideal solutions, have become important catalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation. Ni/Co/Ga doping has promotional effects on In- or Cu-based catalysts, generating a bimetallic system and enhancing methanol synthesis. After doping <10% wt% Ni into In 2 O 3 catalysts, CO 2 conversion and methanol yield are improved 51 . The reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis over Ni-promoted In 2 O 3 has been illustrated by Cannizzaro and colleagues 52 . When Ga is introduced into the Cu/SiO 2 system, abundant Cu + –GaO x interfaces are formed, and methanol synthesis is improved 53 . Additionally, a series of core–shell catalysts, such as Ni@Au ( ), Cu@Ni ( ), Pd@Zn ( ), CoFe/Fe 3 O 4 ( ) and Cu@TiO x ( ), have been reported for CO 2 hydrogenation with excellent product selectivity. Core–shell structures can be reconstructed to an alloy surface or inverse oxide/metal configuration during reactions 54 , 55 , 58 , improving CO selectivity and highlighting that dynamic changes in surface structure should be investigated. Bimetallic solid solutions, such as M a ZrO x (M = Zn, Cd, Ga) 59 , 60 , Ni x Mg 1− x O ( ), In 2 O 3 / m -ZrO 2 ( ) and Ru x Co 1− x catalysts 63 , demonstrate different selectivities and high stabilities compared to conventional supported catalysts. ZnO–ZrO 2 is considered to be a next-generation catalyst for methanol synthesis, and its active sites have been revealed as Zn–O–Zr ( ). Solid-solution catalysts with synergetic active sites are therefore interesting for the design of future CO 2 hydrogenation catalysts. Different supports can influence MSIs and therefore regulate product selectivity. For instance, the MSI over Cu/CeO 2 is weaker than that over Cu/ZrO 2 catalysts, meaning that Cu/CeO 2 catalysts have higher Cu dispersion and more oxygen vacancies, producing *HCOO intermediates for methanol synthesis 65 . The main reaction intermediate over Cu/ZrO 2 is *COOH, generating the CO product. Therefore, MSIs can regulate structural properties to change the reaction adsorption intermediates and tune the final product selectivity. Additionally, different metal–oxide interfacial sites exhibit different *CO/*CH 3 O adsorption abilities, resulting in tunable product selectivity, as demonstrated on Ni–ZrO 2 and Ni–FeO x interfaces 66 , as well as by a comparison of Ni/ZnO with other Ni/MO x catalysts. CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity can be changed by tuning the d ‑band centre over Ni–Zn dual sites, resulting in Ni/ZnO generating more CO product instead of CH 4 , which is produced over other Ni-based catalysts (Table 1 ) 67 . SMSIs or electronic metal–support interactions (EMSIs) have been investigated for improving catalytic performance by correlating metals and supports 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 (c ). The main reason behind the effects of metal/support particle size, metal loading, metal species and metal/support crystal phases on CO 2 hydrogenation is modulation of the chemical state of the metal species and the nature of the metal–oxide interfaces induced by SMSIs or EMSIs. Li and colleagues demonstrated that the SMSI between Ir species and Ce–OH supports could tune product selectivity during CO 2 hydrogenation; metallic Ir particles were found to catalyse CH 4 production, whereas partially oxidized Ir species were favourable for CO production 73 . When Ru NPs were encapsulated by MoO 3− x overlayers or TiO x with abundant oxygen vacancies, induced by the reaction gas and SMSI, selectivity changed from CH 4 to CO (Table 1 ) 74 , 75 . Li and colleagues used NH 3 treatment to disrupt the SMSI and obtained a Ni/ a- TiO 2 -NH 3 catalyst 76 . As a result, both CO 2 conversion and CH 4 selectivity were enhanced, whereas the original Ni/ a -TiO 2 catalyst was selective for CO (Table 1 ). It has also been observed that a Ni/ZrO 2 catalyst exhibits higher low-temperature activity and CH 4 selectivity than a Ni/SiO 2 catalyst due to an enhanced local electron density of active sites, and different reaction pathways induced by SMSIs and reconstructed ZrO 2 species 77 . Dynamic SMSIs under a CO 2 hydrogenation atmosphere and different reduction temperatures have been demonstrated by a series of operando"

The products were then collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water until the supernatant solution was neutral. After freeze-drying for 2 days, 0.15 g of the sample was treated in a tube furnace with 5 vol% H 2 /Ar gas at 150°C for 5 h to introduce defects. The resulting sample was named BWO. Palladium single-atom loading was performed by a typical incipient wet-impregnation method: to prepare 0.05 wt% Pd–O 3 /BWO, 50 mg of BWO nanosheet was impregnated with 100 μl of 0.25 mg Pd ml −1 PdCl 2 /acetonitrile solution. After impregnation, the sample was dried at 60°C for 30 min and then calcinated in a muffle furnace at 175°C for 3 h. The impregnation step remained the same for preparing 0.05 wt% Pd–O 4 /BWO, apart from changing the calcination temperature to 250°C. Palladium nanoparticle loading was followed by thermal reduction: for the preparation of 0.5 wt% Pd Np /BWO, 100 mg BWO, 7.5 mg ascorbic acid, 7.5 mg citric acid and 25 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (mol. wt, 55,000) were added to 9 ml deionized water at 80°C under vigorous stirring. After 30 min, 1.85 ml of 1 mg ml −1 K 2 PdCl 6 solution was injected into the solution dropwise and kept stirring for 4 h. Finally, the solid was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and dried at 60°C overnight, after which the supernatant was almost transparent, indicating the successful loading of palladium nanoparticles on the support. Catalytic evaluation Single-batch reaction system Typically, 5 mg photocatalysts and 0.1 mmol toluene were dispersed in 2 ml acetonitrile and transferred into a 10-ml quartz tube with continuous stirring. Then, O 2 was steadily bubbled through the solution. The photocatalytic reactions were performed on a WATTCAS Parallel Light Reactor (WP-TEC-1020HSL), using an 8-W, 400–405-nm purple LED, which was integrated with a water circulation system that maintained the temperature constant at 25°C (room temperature). The light power density was measured through direct contact with the light source by an optical power and energy meter (Thorlabs-PM 100D) as 130 mW cm − 2 . After irradiation for a specified time, the mixture was collected and the photocatalysts were separated by centrifugation. The obtained supernatant was detected and quantitatively analysed by GC–MS with an electron capture detector (Thermo Trace GC Ultra) and GC with a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC 2010 Plus). Flow reaction system Generally, 37.5 mg photocatalysts and 0.75 mmol toluene were thoroughly dispersed in 15 ml acetonitrile by sonication. Then, the mixture was transferred to a vessel with continuous stirring and water cooling to guarantee a constant room temperature (25°C). Subsequently, the mixture was pumped into the photochemical flow reaction reactor (9 ml liquid hold-up volume) via a peristaltic pump. Meanwhile, the compressed air was introduced and controlled by a flow meter to form monodispersed bubbles in the reactor channels. After the specified reaction time, the mixture was collected and centrifuged, and the contents finally detected and analysed. The flow reaction device is fitted with a 405-nm LED panel as the light source. This panel was clamped to the device and its light power density was measured through direct contact with the light source by an optical power and energy meter (Thorlabs-PM 100D) as 120 mW cm − 2 . The product detection and quantitative analysis were performed in the same way as for the single-batch system.

The catalyst was put into a ceramic cell and placed in the detection chamber. After pretreatment in a nitrogen atmosphere at 100°C for 30 min, the catalyst was cooled to room temperature to record the background spectrum. Subsequently, toluene was introduced into the chamber by nitrogen bubbling for 30 min. Then, the physisorbed toluene was removed by nitrogen flow (the signal remained almost unchanged after 14 min). Oxygen was introduced, and simultaneously a 405-nm light source was turned on. To acquire the analytical spectra, 128 scans were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm −1 .

Galvanic oxidation setup In order to validate the direct redox interaction between PMS and phenol on the surface of the catalyst, we undertook galvanic cell experiments using a two -chamber reactor setup. A carbon paper electrode (2 cm × 2 cm) was employed as the substrate for loading the catalyst. Initially, 10 mg of catalyst powder was combined with a mixture comprising 40 uL Nafion solution and 1 mL of isopropanol. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was subjected to 60 min of sonication to ensure formation of a homogeneous ink. A portion of the catalyst ink (0.2 m L) was then evenly applied to one side of the carbon paper and dried at room temperature. Within the galvanic cell system featuring two chambers, one cell was loaded with a solution containing 0.2 mM phenol and 50 mM Na 2SO 4 (as the electrolyte), while the other cell contained a solution of 50 mM Na 2SO 4.

After adsorption, the cotton with catalysts dried at 60 oC. Phenol solution is 5 ppm in this column system. Text S 10. Computational Details . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (V ASP)3,4. The electron -ion potential was described by the projected augmented wave method (PAW)5, and a plane -wave energy cut -off of 450 eV was set in this study. The Perdew -Burk -Ernzerhof (PBE) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to describe the exchange - correlation functional6. The convergence criterion of the force was -0.03 eV/Å and the convergence thresholds for the total energy was 10-5 eV . Since GGA cannot correctly describe strongly correlated systems containing partially filled d subshells, the GGA+U method is applied to describe partially filled d orbitals by taking into account Coulomb and exchange corrections. We used correlation e nergy (U) of 4 eV and exchange energy (J) of 1 eV for transition metal ™ d orbitals. The Brillouin -zone integration was approximated 4×4×1 by a grid using the Monkhorst -Pack k -point mesh. A vacuum space of 15 Å in the Z -direction was chosen to avoid arti ficial interaction. The effect of van der Waals (vdW) interactions was included for weak interaction cases using the semiempirical correction scheme of Becke -Jonson damping, DFT -D3 7. The adsorption energy of *PMS ( ΔE) on the catalyst surface was calculated by ΔE= E(*PMS) – E(slab) - E(PMS) in which E(*PMS), E(slab) and E(PMS) are the total energy of the catalyst slab with adsorbed PMS, the catalyst slab and the energy of PMS, respectively."

Low temperature activation of TiO 2 A certain amount of TiO 2 was weighed and transferred to a petri dish. The petri dish was placed in a vacuum drying oven, where the vacuum was applied, and the material was subjected to vacu um activation at 197°C for different durations. The resulting material was activated TiO 2. Text S14. Synthesis of TiO 2 3.0 g of Ti(SO 4)2 was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring for 1 hour until fully dissolved. After dissolut ion, 0.1 g of glucose was added and stirred until dissolved. Subsequently, 144 mg lanthanum nitrate was introduced, and the solution was stirred for an additional 4 hours. The resulting mixture was transferred into a hydrothermal reactor and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 180°C for 12 hours. TiO 2 was obtained by washing with a sintered glass funnel, vacuum drying at 60°C for 12 hours. S13 conventional methods primarily rely on van der Waals forces or charge -based attractions, OCTP involves the aggregation of low -polarity, poorly water -soluble reaction i ntermediates on the catalyst surface. This unique behavior is driven by the intrinsic properties of the intermediates — such as reduced polarity and solubility —which promote their preferential accumulation on the S47 catalyst surface rather than remaining dissol ved in the aqueous phase.

SiO 2 powder (360 mg) was sonicated in 100 ml deionized water to produce a nearly homogeneous slurry. Then, 0.4 mmol Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ∙6H 2 O was added and dissolved in the solution, followed by the rapid injection of 0.8 ml NH 3 ∙H 2 O (2M) under stirring for 3 min before vacuum filtration. The resulting solid particles were separated and air-dried overnight at room temperature. The dried powders were ground into finer particles and subsequently calcined in a muffle furnace at 500°C (with an initial temperature ramp of 5°C min –1 ) for 12 h. Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg CeO x /SiO 2 in 120 ml deionized water 22 . The pH value of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 51 μmol H 2 PtCl 6 and 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. With the slurry magnetically stirred for 5 h, the platinum-containing precursor solution was slowly added into the CeO x /SiO 2 slurry. After stirring for another 2 h, the mixture was separated by vacuum filtration to give platinum-containing solid particles, which were then washed several times with deionized water. The resultant powder was calcined at 600°C for 12 h to form the as-synthesized catalyst. Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 was reduced in flowing 10% H 2 /helium at 400°C for 1 h to produce the Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED samples containing platinum clusters.

The 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 sample was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg CeO x /SiO 2 in 120 ml deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 26 μmol H 2 PtCl 6 and 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. The adsorption, calcination and reduction steps were the same as those stated above to produce the as-synthesized 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 catalyst and 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED samples containing platinum clusters. The 0.8 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 sample was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg as-synthesized Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 (0.5 wt%, calcined at 500°C for 12 h) in 120 ml deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 26 μmol H 2 PtCl 6 and 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. The adsorption, calcination and reduction were done as stated above to produce the as-synthesized 0.8 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 catalyst and 0.8 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED samples containing platinum clusters. The 1.2 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 sample was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg as-synthesized Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 (0.5 wt%, calcined at 500°C for 12 h) in 120 ml deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 51 μmol H 2 PtCl 6 and 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. The adsorption, calcination and reduction were done as stated above to produce the as-synthesized 1.2 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 catalyst and 1.2 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED samples containing platinum clusters. XAS XAS was performed at beamlines 4-1 and 15-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. Conventional data were collected at beamline 4-1; this is a side station on a 20-pole wiggler beamline. The ring (SPEAR3) was operated in the top-off mode; the storage ring energy was 3 GeV and the stored current was 500 mA. To minimize harmonics at the platinum L 3 edge, the double-crystal Si monochromator was detuned by 20%–30% of the maximum intensity. Ex situ spectra were collected in the fluorescence yield mode with a 30-element germanium solid-state detector array. The samples were pressed into pellets and mounted on a plate, and the data were recorded at room temperature. In operando XAS experiments were done with approximately 40 mg samples loaded in a tubular flow-through quartz cell (inside diameter, 2.8 mm) through which the treatment gases flowed 24 . HERFD-XANES experiments were performed at beamline 15-2, which is equipped with a 56-pole, 0.9 T wiggler and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled double-crystal Si monochromator for selection of the incident-beam energy. A Rowland circle spectrometer having a radius of 1 m and equipped with three spherically bent Si analyzers and a silicon drift detector were used to select the platinum L α emission line 50 . In each HERFD-XANES experiment, an approximately 40 mg sample was loaded in the flow-through cell that was fed with the treatment gas. ATHENA and ARTEMIS software 51 were used to analyze the EXAFS data. Data alignment, edge calibration, deglitching, normalization and background subtraction were performed with ATHENA. The platinum L 3 edge energy was determined by the first inflection point of the absorption edge data characterizing a platinum-foil reference, calibrated to the reported energy of 11,564.0 eV. Data fitting was performed considering k 1 , k 2 and k 3 weightings. The fitting ranges in k space and R space in the data analysis for each sample were determined by the data quality. These values were used with the Nyquist theorem for the estimation of the justified number of fitting parameters, which was not exceeded in the reported fits. The amplitude reduction factor, S 0 2 , was determined by fitting the experimental platinum-foil data, and then fixed for further analysis of the data characterizing the various samples (Supplementary and Supplementary Table 1 ). The parameters characterizing the local structure environment including the CN, scattering path distance between the absorber and backscattering atoms ( R ), mean square relative displacement (Δ σ 2 , disorder term) and inner potential correction (Δ E 0 ) were allowed to vary in the fitting. Various plausible models were considered in the fitting. The quality of fit was determined by the minimization of the R factor. Standard procedures were used in the analysis of the XANES data 51 . STEM HAADF-STEM imaging was performed with an aberration-corrected JEOL ARM-200F microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and an image resolution of 0.08 nm in the HAADF imaging mode and, separately, with a double-aberration-corrected Themis Z microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV and an image resolution of 0.06 nm. The catalyst powders were loaded on lacey-carbon-coated copper transmission electron microscopy grids, and low electron probe currents were used to reduce the electron-beam-induced effects. Infrared spectroscopy A Bruker IFS 66v spectrometer (equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT) detector) and a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT-A) detector) were used to collect the DRIFTS data characterizing the powder samples. The spectral resolution was 4 cm −1 . The cell was partly filled with approximately 50 mg of inert KBr powder, followed by adding approximately 10 mg of catalyst packed onto the KBr. The cell was connected into a flow system that allowed the recording of spectra as the reactant gases (CO (10% in helium, Airgas), helium (Praxair, UHP grade), 13 CO (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 99.5%), ethylene (Airgas, UHP grade) and/or H 2 (Airgas, UHP grade)) flowed through the cell at the desired temperature. The background spectra were recorded at room temperature for the as-synthesized Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 and Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -OX samples in the presence of flowing helium (40 ml (NTP) min –1 ). CO adsorption was conducted by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min –1 of 10% CO/helium for 30 min. The CO desorption spectra were recorded following a helium purge at a flow rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 to remove gas-phase CO from the cell. To prepare and characterize the reduced catalyst, namely, Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED, H 2 reduction treatments were conducted with the sample in the cell before CO adsorption. The cell was heated in 10% H 2 /helium flowing at 40 ml (NTP) min –1 as the temperature was ramped from room temperature to 400°C at a rate of 10°C min –1 followed by a dwell time of 1 h at 400°C. Then, the cell was cooled to room temperature, and the gas feed was switched to a helium flow at 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . The background spectra were recorded at room temperature with the sample in helium flowing at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . Thereafter, CO adsorption experiments were conducted by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min –1 of 10% CO/helium for 30 min. The CO desorption spectra were recorded during a helium purge at a flow rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . In 13 CO adsorption experiments, the background spectra were recorded at room temperature with helium flowing through the cell at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . 13 CO adsorption was conducted by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min –1 of 25% 13 CO/helium for 20 min. 13 CO desorption spectra were recorded during the flow of helium purge gas at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 ; this treatment removed gas-phase 13 CO from the cell. To characterize the performance of the used Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 sample, the catalytic reaction was carried out with the sample in the DRIFTS cell in a mixture of H 2 flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min –1 + ethylene flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min –1 + helium flowing at 32 ml (NTP) min –1 at 70°C; the pressure was atmospheric, and the run continued for 176 h. Then, the cell was cooled to room temperature, and the gas feed was switched to helium flowing at 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . The background spectra were recorded at room temperature with helium flowing through the cell at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . Thereafter, CO adsorption was investigated by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min –1 of 10% CO/helium for 30 min. CO desorption spectra were recorded during a helium purge at a flow rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 to remove gas-phase CO from the cell. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry The platinum loading of each catalyst sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, performed using a Thermo Scientific XSERIES 2 instrument. XPS measurements The XPS measurements were performed with a K-Alpha Plus XPS/UPS analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1,486.6 eV) with the samples placed in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber. The system reached a stable pressure, typically in the mid 10 −10 torr range, after ~12 h without the sample, or in the 10 −8 torr range with the sample present. Samples were mounted on conductive silver tape. A vacuum transfer module was used to transfer samples directly from a glove box to the XPS chamber without air exposure. A flood gun was used during the measurements to dynamically compensate for sample charging. A step size of 0.1 eV and a pass energy of 50 eV were used for each spectrum. The spectra were calibrated by setting the Si 2 p signal of SiO 2 to 103.4 eV ( ). CasaXPS software version 2.3.25 was used for further data calibration and processing. XRD crystallography XRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a Philips X’Pert Pro Super diffractometer, equipped with a monochromatized Cu Kα radiation source at a wavelength of 0.1542 nm. Ethylene hydrogenation catalysis in a conventional flow reactor Ethylene hydrogenation catalysis experiments were done with a once-through temperature-controlled tubular plug-flow reactor (inside diameter, 4 mm) at various temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The products were analyzed with an online Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 50 m × 0.53 mm PLOT Alumina ‘M’ capillary column. Samples of the catalyst (Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 and Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED) powder (12 mg) mixed with 500 mg of inert non-porous α-Al 2 O 3 particles were loaded into the reactor, with the upstream and downstream sections packed with quartz wool. The catalyst masses were 12 mg and 6 mg for 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED and 1.2 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED, respectively, and the catalyst powders were mixed with 500 mg of inert non-porous α-Al 2 O 3 powders. In these catalysis experiments, the feed was a mixture of H 2 flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min –1 + ethylene flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min –1 + helium flowing at 32 ml (NTP) min –1 . The values of near-steady-state TOF were determined directly from the conversions of ethylene, which were <5.0% and shown to be differential 53 . After each catalyst reached steady-state operation, no substantial deactivation was observed at longer times on stream (176 h). Thereafter, the catalytic reaction experiments were carried out at various temperatures with the same feed gas to provide near-steady-state conversions at various temperatures. Each reported catalytic reaction rate (TOF) at each temperature is based on data from approximately 8 h of near-steady-state operation. n -Hexadecane hydrocracking n -Hexadecane hydrocracking was carried out in a stirred 50 ml Hastelloy slurry reactor at 260°C for 6 h. In a typical test, the reactor was flushed with H 2 ten times to remove any residual air after the addition of 200 mg of catalyst (100 mg Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED + 100 mg HY zeolite (Si:Al = 40, atomic)) and 2.00 g of n -hexadecane. HY zeolite was pretreated by calcination at 500°C for 5 h. The reactor was pressurized with 3.0 MPa of H 2 at room temperature and heated and held at 260°C for 6 h. The gas phase and products dissolved in n -hexadecane were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-2014). Computational methods Spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package code at the generalized gradient approximation level within the projector augmented wave/Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof formalism 54 , 55 . Hubbard U ( U eff = 5.0 eV) with effective on-site Coulomb interaction correction was used for the strongly correlated 4 f electrons of cerium 56 . A CeO 2 slab model (11.5 Å × 13.3 Å) with three triatomic layers was adopted to investigate the evolution of interfacial structures from that incorporating isolated single Pt 1 O x species to Pt n clusters. The total energy calculations were performed using a 2 × 2 × 1 grid and a plane-wave cut-off energy of 400 eV. A vacuum space greater than 15 Å was added in the z direction to avoid interaction with each slab. Atoms in the bottom triatomic layer of a catalyst model were fixed, and all the other atoms, including adsorbates, were allowed to relax until the force on each ion was less than 0.02 eV Å –1 . The cohesive energy ( E coh ) is defined as E coh = E clusters+slab – E slab – n * E Pt1 , where E clusters+slab , E slab , n and E Pt1 are the Gibbs free energy of optimized Pt n /CeO 2 and Gibbs free energy of optimized CeO 2 , the nuclearity of the platinum clusters and the energy of an isolated single platinum atom, respectively. To check the stability of the candidate cluster structures under the experimental conditions, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed. The selected structures after the standard structure optimization calculations were used to run the AIMD simulations for a period of 3 ps at 400°C by setting the canonical ensemble ( NVT ) with a Nose–Hoover thermostat. Then, the generated configurations were further optimized using standard DFT calculations to demonstrate the stability. The optimal adsorption configurations of the reactants (C 2 H 4 and H 2 ) on the selective Pt 1 O 5 H and Pt n clusters were searched. The adsorption energy ( E ads ) is defined as E ads = E adsorb/surf – E surf – E adsorb , where E adsorb/surf , E surf and E adsorb represent the total energies of the slab with adsorbate(s), the clean slab and the isolated adsorbate, respectively. For each elementary step in C 2 H 4 hydrogenation, the initial and final states were first optimized. The transition states were then searched using both the climbing image nudged elastic band method and the complete linear/quadratic synchronous transit method 57 , 58 . The accuracy of the transition states was confirmed by analyzing the vibrational frequencies. The Gibbs free energy change is defined as Δ G = Δ E + ΔZPE – T Δ S , where Δ E is obtained from DFT calculations and ΔZPE is the correction in zero-point energies.
