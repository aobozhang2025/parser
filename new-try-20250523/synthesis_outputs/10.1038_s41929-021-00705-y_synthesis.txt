==================================================

Synthesis of CoPc/CNT CoPc/CNT was synthesized following an analogous protocol reported in the literature 73 . CoPc (1 mg) was mixed with 30 mg of a multiwall CNT in 30 ml dimethylformamide solution and stirred for 24 h. The suspension became transparent. The final suspension was washed using EtOH and H 2 O within a centrifuge to remove the dimethylformamide, and after that was freeze-dried to give the final catalyst. Electrode preparation Carbon paper (1 cm × 2.5 cm, Freudenberg C2H23) was sonicated in ethanol and deionized water for 15 min and dried as the electrode substrate. The catalyst ink was prepared using 4.0 mg of catalyst mixed with 60 μl of Nafion solution (5% in ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 μl of isopropanol and 200 μl of deionized water. After 15 min of sonification, the ink was deposited on the microporous layer of carbon paper to achieve an area of 1 cm 2 with catalyst loading of 1 mg cm –2 . Electrochemical measurement The electrochemical CO 2 R performance was measured in a regular three-electrode H-cell divided by a Nafion N117 membrane. The working electrode was the catalyst-coated carbon paper mentioned above, and a Pt mesh was deployed as the counter electrodes. A leak-free Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference. The current density was normalized to the working electrode’s geometrical area (1 cm 2 ). All the electrochemical experiments were performed in a CO 2 -purged electrolyte (CO 2 flow rate, 30 ml min –1 ). The pH value of each is presented in Supplementary Table 1 . Product analysis A Shimadzu 2014 on-line gas chromatograph was utilized for product quantification. The gas stream was separated by Hayesep Q + R columns and then analysed by a thermoconductivity detector and flame ionization detector. The thermoconductivity detector detects the volume percentage of the H 2 product, and the flame ionization detector measures the CO after methanization. On all the NiNC type catalysts, no liquid product was found after the electrolysis. Calculations of the production rate, partial current density and Faradaic efficiency are given in the Supplementary Methods .
