The stability of DMAPA on Pd/SiO

was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Supplementary 
). Adsorbed DMAPA starts to desorb at 165 °C and removal is complete by 350 °C. The weight loss corresponds to 0.16 mmol of DMAPA adsorbed over 1 g of Pd/SiO

catalyst (Supplementary 
). The amount of desorbed DMAPA is almost equal to the number of surface Pd atoms. This suggests that the stoichiometric molar ratio between surface Pd atoms and adsorbed DMAPA molecules is about 1. The hydrogenation of toluene over D-Pd/SiO

was conducted in three consecutive cycles with no activity. This demonstrates the high stability of the DMAPA coverage on the palladium surface (Supplementary 
). However, calcination at 350 °C for 3 h recovers the activity of the catalyst (Supplementary 
). The regeneration of the DMAPA-poisoned Pd/SiO

catalyst by treatment at 350 °C therefore means that DMAPA adsorption for modification of the surface in these palladium catalysts can be performed multiple times.
The peaks observed in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) N 1s spectrum of D-Pd/SiO

confirm the presence of DMAPA on the catalyst surface 
). The N 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks with binding energies of 400.2 and 401.4 eV associated with N=C and N–C species, respectively, which are attributed to the adsorbed DMAPA molecules on the palladium surface. The presence of C=N on the D-Pd/SiO

sample indicates partial dehydrogenation of C–N to C=N on the palladium surface

. The dehydrogenation of DMAPA on the palladium surface has been further demonstrated by FTIR 
). The FTIR absorption peak at 1,695 cm
−1
corresponds to the imine groups on the surface of the D-Pd/SiO

catalyst

. The other FTIR peaks at 2,800–3,000 and 1,500 cm
−

were assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations of C–H bonds in DMAPA

. It is worth mentioning that spontaneous dehydrogenation of amines on the palladium surface has previously been reported

.
The poisoning of the palladium surface with DMAPA was further investigated. Temperature-programmed reaction combined with mass spectroscopy (TPR-MS) analysis confirms DMAPA desorption (fragment of

, Supplementary 
). Notably, no decomposition of DMAPA was observed when the Pd/SiO

catalyst was pretreated with DMAPA in cyclohexane in a batch reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere at 80 °C (Supplementary 
). Moreover, solid-state NMR analysis (

N,

H,

C) of D-Pd/SiO

confirmed the presence of DMAPA species on the palladium surface 
). The

C NMR spectrum has broad resonance peaks with maxima at approximately 25, 60 and 150 ppm, which can be attributed to the internal methylene CH

group, close to the methylated N and C atoms in the imine group. The additional narrow peak at 42.1 ppm corresponds to methyl groups and is less affected by interaction with the support

. The

N cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectrum exhibits a resonance peak at ~61.8 ppm, which can be assigned to the methylated amine group in DMAPA

. The nitrogen peak of the imine group is very broad due to the strong interaction with palladium. The

H NMR shows a broad peak between 1.3 and 5 ppm and a peak at ~6.8 ppm that could be ascribed to H linked to C and N atoms in DMAPA, respectively

. Interaction of DMAPA with palladium was additionally studied by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The positive ToF-SIMS spectrum of D-Pd/SiO

) contains the peaks attributed to the fragmentation of adsorbed DMAPA producing the C

H

N

ion (58.1 u, where u is 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom) as the main signal. It is interesting to note that the negative ToF-SIMS spectrum shows an isotopic pattern attributed to PdCN
−
, indicating chemical bonding of the C–N group with Pd 
). Thus, DMAPA adsorbs molecularly on the palladium surface during the imprinting procedure.
The concept of imprinting implies the preservation of the morphology and electronic properties of the palladium nanoparticles after poisoning by DMAPA. 
summarizes the X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and XPS (Pd 3d) data of the Pd/SiO

and D-Pd/SiO

catalysts. Three well-resolved XRD peaks observed on both D-Pd/SiO

and Pd/SiO

catalysts correspond to Pd , Pd and Pd planes, respectively

. The D-Pd/SiO

catalyst has the same X-ray diffraction pattern as the parent Pd/SiO

, indicating the palladium phase has similar crystallographic properties before and after poisoning

. Similar palladium morphology and particle size were also confirmed by TEM analysis ,d
). Low-temperature N

adsorption also shows similar textural properties of the catalyst before and after poisoning (Supplementary 
). The XPS Pd 3d core-level spectra of both Pd/SiO

and D-Pd/SiO

samples show a dominating doublet with Pd 3d

binding energy of 335.3 eV, corresponding to the metallic state of palladium 
). A small doublet with a Pd 3d

peak at 337.1 eV for Pd/SiO

catalyst is assigned to Pd

. In the spectrum of D-Pd/SiO

, the Pd
2+
-related doublet is shifted to lower Pd 3d
5/2
binding energies of 336.6 eV. This shift could be attributed to the effect of interaction between Pd and DMAPA. The DMAPA nitrogen species with a lone pair of electrons will donate electrons to Pd, leading to Pd sites with a higher electronic density and which exhibit a lower XPS binding energy

. Although the electronic properties of surface Pd have changed, most of the Pd in the nanoparticles is still in the same metallic electronic state as in the parent Pd/SiO

catalyst.

Thus, characterization and catalytic tests of Pd/SiO

and D-Pd/SiO

suggest that DMAPA could effectively poison the palladium surface.
Catalyst design by molecular imprinting
To investigate the possibility of molecular imprinting on Pd/SiO

, toluene was selected as a template, while DMAPA was used as a poisoner. In situ FTIR analysis was used to monitor the imprinting process –e
). The adsorption of toluene over Pd/SiO

) demonstrates a set of noticeable adsorption peaks at 1,603 and 1,496 cm
−1
corresponding to the breathing vibrations of the phenyl ring

. According to the literature, toluene can be horizontally adsorbed over a palladium surface via the interaction between the conjugated phenyl ring and palladium planes

. Next, the sample was subjected to DMAPA. Similar to the D-Pd/SiO

catalyst, a new infrared peak at 1,695 cm
−

, which is attributed to the C=N stretching in imine, appeared immediately after adding DMAPA. However, the peaks of toluene (1,603 and 1,496 cm
−

) were still visible, confirming the simultaneous presence of DMAPA and toluene on the palladium surface. The co-presence of toluene and DMAPA on the palladium surface demonstrates that toluene can protect at least some of the palladium active sites during DMAPA poisoning and thus can create active islands after toluene desorption, as illustrated in 
(
). It is worth noting that when heating the sample in the presence of hydrogen at 120 °C, the intensity of the peak at 1,695 cm
−

decreases substantially, whereas the peaks at 1,500 and 2,800–3000 cm
−

were unaffected. This suggests that the imine groups were hydrogenated back to amine, which remains, however, still adsorbed on the palladium surface 
). Hydrogen evacuation leads to the reappearance of the imine infrared peak at 1,695 cm
−

due to the amine dehydrogenation back to imine groups on the palladium surface 
). Notably, heating at 120 °C in the presence of H

results in the disappearance of the peaks at 1,603 and 1,496 cm
−

, indicating the desorption of the template molecules.
The imprinted Pd/SiO

catalysts were also prepared using molecular templates larger than toluene (TL-Print-Pd/SiO

), such as mesitylene (ML-Print-Pd/SiO

) and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

). To distinguish the effects of imprinting and partial deactivation, partially deactivated Pd/SiO

(Partial-D-Pd/SiO

) was prepared as a reference material. CO FTIR was used to analyse the active sites on palladium 
). The CO adsorption on the parent Pd/SiO

results in several infrared peaks at 2,074, 1,965 and 1,920 cm
−

, which correspond respectively, to linear, bridged and three-fold bonded CO (
). The last two types of sites are mainly present over the crystal planes, while linear CO adsorption occurs mainly over isolated sites. Thus, over the initial Pd/SiO

catalyst containing large palladium nanoparticles, the peak ratio of linear to multiply bonded CO (L/M) is only 0.06. The catalyst prepared by imprinting with a large template molecule (TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

) has a notably higher contribution of linearly adsorbed CO in comparison with initial Pd/SiO

. This L/M ratio increases further for the smaller template molecules in the order TPB (0.17) < ML (0.2) < TL (0.22), which could be explained by the decrease in the area of the active palladium zones. The highest ratio is observed over Partial-D-Pd/SiO

, where only Pd atoms isolated between adsorbed DMAPA are available. The infrared peaks of CO adsorption over the DMAPA-treated catalysts have shifted to lower wavenumbers in comparison with parent Pd/SiO

. This red shift further confirms the XPS results, which suggest electron donation from N to Pd

.
High-angular annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging in scanning TEM (STEM) mode was used for further analysis of the imprinted Pd/SiO

catalyst 
). To identify the active islands, platinum was deposited on the imprinted areas. Platinum has a much higher atomic number than palladium (78 versus 46) and HAADF intensity is proportional to ~
Z
1.7
, where
Z
is the atomic number. Therefore, Pt atoms would appear brighter on the surface of palladium particles. This contrast between the Pt and Pd atoms in HAADF images makes it possible to a certain extent to highlight the imprinted areas

,

. TPB ~0.85 nm in size was selected as a template for the preparation of the molecularly imprinted Pd/SiO

catalyst for the STEM analysis

. The deposition of Pt atoms was performed by mild reduction of Pt(acac)

solution on the initial Pd/SiO

, D-Pd/SiO

, TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

and Partial-D-Pd/SiO

catalysts in the presence of H

. Due to the strong hydrogen activation by palladium, the Pt atoms should be selectively reduced on the imprinted areas. No platinum reduction is expected on the DMAPA-poisoned palladium surface, where all surface Pd atoms are covered by the poisoner 
). The STEM energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images of initial Pd/SiO

with deposited Pt atoms indicate the formation of a core–shell structure with a Pd core and Pt shell of 1.4–3 nm –d
). The formation of uniform platinum shells around palladium nanoparticles demonstrates the high activity of the palladium surface toward platinum reduction. Note that completely deactivated Pd/SiO

has a very low number of Pt atoms on the palladium surface –g
), confirming that the palladium surface has been poisoned by DMAPA. Interestingly, molecular imprinting with TPB as a template shows no platinum shell on the palladium surface –j
). EDS mapping clearly shows isolated platinum clusters over the palladium surface. Partial deactivation of the catalyst by DMAPA without template deposition shows uniform coverage of platinum over palladium nanoparticles without the formation of distinct platinum islands –m
).

The HAADF images of the imprinted areas are shown in 
. The platinum islands (showing bright) range in size from 0.6 to 1.1 nm (average, 0.8 nm). The size of the platinum islands therefore agrees with the dimensions of the TPB template molecule 
and Supplementary –c
). The detection of platinum islands on the imprinted palladium surface provides, at least qualitatively, some additional proof for preparation of the imprinted zones of predetermined size on the palladium surface. HAADF images of Partial-D-Pd/SiO

show a random distribution of DMAPA on the palladium surface with the generation of small, non-uniform Pt clusters. Notably, single Pt atoms have been frequently observed on the Partial-D-Pd/SiO

catalyst (Supplementary 
).
To further confirm the differences in the sizes of the platinum islands, the samples were studied by Pt L

edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)

. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra confirm that platinum is mostly metallic after reduction over palladium nanoparticles (Supplementary 
). Supplementary 
shows the Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) moduli of the samples (without phase shift). The fitted interatomic distances are given in Supplementary 
. In agreement with the literature, the peaks at 2.7 Å are assigned to Pt–Pt coordination. EXAFS indicates that the Pt atoms are coordinated by both Pt and Pd atoms in the parent catalyst, while the number of the Pt–Pt bonds decreases both in the imprinted (TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

) and in the partially deactivated catalysts (Partial-D-Pd/SiO

). The decrease in the Pt–Pt coordination number is consistent with the presence of platinum islands on the imprinted catalyst and homogeneously distributed isolated Pt atoms over the partially deactivated sample (Supplementary 
).
Model reactions over the imprinted Pd/SiO

catalyst
The prepared TL-Print-Pd/SiO

, ML-Print-Pd/SiO

and TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

were tested in several model catalytic reactions. The size of each resulting imprinted area should decrease in the following sequence TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

> ML-Print-Pd/SiO

> TL-Print-Pd/SiO

in agreement with the decrease in the sizes of the template molecules.
As has been reported earlier

,

, hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires flat adsorption of the molecules over the metal surface. If the molecule is larger than the imprinted area, it cannot be hydrogenated because of steric hindrance during adsorption.
The amount of adsorbed DMAPA molecules over the studied catalysts was determined by TGA. As shown in Supplementary 
, the weight losses over Partial-D-Pd/SiO

, TL-Print-Pd/SiO

, ML-Print-Pd/SiO

and TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

were 1.09%, 0.98%, 1.02% and 1.38%, corresponding to 0.11, 0.096, 0.1 and 0.14 mmol g
−1
of DMAPA, respectively. The active sites in the imprinted catalysts were measured by H

-pulse chemisorption. As summarized in Supplementary 
, the cumulative H

uptakes were 0.048, 0.06, 0.051 and 0.035 mmol g
−1
over the Partial-D-Pd/SiO

, TL-Print-Pd/SiO

, ML-Print-Pd/SiO

and TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

catalysts, respectively. The H

-pulse chemisorption correlates well with the TGA. Note that higher DMAPA adsorption correlates with lower H

uptake over the imprinted or deactivated catalysts 
). The slightly higher amount of bare Pd atoms calculated from H

chemisorption over the imprinted catalyst could be explained by the electronic effect of DMAPA on Pd, which can increase the stoichiometric ratio of H to Pd

. In addition to the H

adsorption, we have performed pulse adsorption of toluene (Supplementary 
). The parent Pd/SiO

catalyst demonstrates high toluene adsorption (0.028 mmol g
−1
), whereas no adsorption occurs over completely poisoned D-Pd/SiO

. Interestingly, TL-Print-Pd/SiO

shows adsorption of toluene by refilling the imprinting areas (0.005 mmol g
−1
). An increase in the size of imprinted zones in TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

leads to higher adsorption of toluene (0.008 mmol g
−1
).

The turnover frequencies (TOFs) over the studied catalysts were calculated based on the H

-pulse chemisorption results assuming the same intrinsic activity of all available bare Pd atoms in the hydrogenation reactions 
). The TOFs of hydrogenation of toluene, mesitylene and TPB over parent Pd/SiO

in the batch reactor were 88.94, 34.04 and 53.39 h
−1
, respectively. The complete poisoning of the Pd catalysts with DMAPA results in a complete loss of activity, and therefore TOFs of zero for hydrogenation of all studied aromatic molecules.

Surprisingly, the toluene-imprinted Pd/SiO

(TL-Print-Pd/SiO

) catalyst still shows a high TOF for toluene (1.96 h
−1
), but extremely low TOFs for the hydrogenation of mesitylene (0.08 h
−1
) and TPB (0.03 h
−1
). This phenomenon can be explained by the presence of active islands over the palladium surface created by preadsorbed toluene. In this case, the active islands on the palladium surface with the shape and size of the toluene molecule can hinder the adsorption of larger molecules such as mesitylene and TPB. This explanation has been further supported by using mesitylene as a template. ML-Print-Pd/SiO

exhibits higher TOFs for both toluene and mesitylene (2.51 and 0.44 h
−1
) but a low TOF for TPB (0.03 h
−1
). Furthermore, Pd/SiO

imprinted by TPB has demonstrated high TOFs for hydrogenation of toluene (4.24 h
−1
), mesitylene (0.82 h
−1
) and TPB (0.95 h
−1
). The increase in the size of template molecules results therefore in the expansion of active islands and hydrogenation of larger molecules. It is worth noting that the partially deactivated Pd/SiO

catalyst (Partial-D-Pd/SiO

) exhibits different catalytic behaviour compared with the imprinted catalysts. The TOFs for toluene, mesitylene and TPB over Partial-D-Pd/SiO

catalyst are 0.79, 0.28 and 0.32 h
−1
, respectively. In comparison with the imprinted counterparts, the activity is comparable for all molecules over Partial-D-Pd/SiO

, indicating the indiscriminating distribution of DMAPA on the palladium surface without the generation of any specific islands for the adsorption of aromatic rings. Indeed, the random coverage of the catalyst surface with DMAPA could have a positive effect on the selective and preferential hydrogenation of small molecules at higher coverage of DMAPA, when the probability of finding adjacent sites goes down. To check this effect, hydrogenation of toluene, mesitylene and TPB were performed over Pd/SiO

in the presence of different concentrations of DMAPA (Supplementary 
). Although higher hydrogenation activity was observed for toluene, we did not observe any clear size-dependent effect of DMAPA poisoning for larger molecules (Supplementary 
). Thus, the size-dependent reactivity was indeed introduced by the imprinting process and is not a consequence of the electronic or poisoning effects of adsorbed DMAPA.
The effect of imprinting on the studied Pd/SiO

catalysts was further confirmed by performing gas-phase catalytic reactions in a fixed-bed reactor to exclude the possibility of a competitive adsorption effect of desorbed DMAPA in the liquid phase on the catalytic performance 
). In agreement with the liquid-phase reactions, a remarkable imprinting effect was observed over imprinted Pd/SiO

catalyst. It should be noted that no imprinting effect was observed over the Partial-D-Pd/SiO

catalyst.
Stability of the catalyst is one of the most important issues in catalysis. Migration of DMAPA on the palladium surface could cause these imprinted catalysts to lose selectivity. It is worth noting that adsorbates on the metal surface have often been found to be mobile under reaction conditions

. Importantly, the imprinted ML-Print-Pd/SiO

catalyst demonstrates stable activity in three consecutive cycles of the hydrogenation of toluene, mesitylene and TPB (Supplementary 
). Furthermore, ML-Print-Pd/SiO

exhibits stable conversion for 10 h in the fixed-bed reactor in the gas-phase hydrogenation of toluene, mesitylene and TPB 
). This suggests the lack of mobility of DMAPA over the palladium surface, although other possibilities—for instance, the formation of dynamic voids—cannot be excluded at this stage. In general, DMAPA adsorption over palladium leads to irreversible deactivation of the metal catalysts due to the generation of metal–N bonds

,

.
The stability of the imprinting areas was further confirmed by characterization of the imprinted Used-TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

catalyst by CO FTIR, TEM and XAS. CO FTIR of the Used-TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

exhibited a similar L/M ratio as the fresh catalyst (0.16 versus 0.17, Supplementary 
), indicating the active palladium zones on both samples were of similar size. After platinum deposition, the same platinum islands with an average size of 0.8 nm were observed on the Used-TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

and fresh TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

catalysts –p,s,t
and Supplementary –f
) by TEM. The Pt L

edge XANES and EXAFS of Used-TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

and fresh TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

were also very similar (Supplementary 
and Supplementary 
). All these characterizations indicate high stability of the imprinted areas on the TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

catalyst.
If the molecular imprinting introduces a size-dependent effect for the hydrogenation of aromatic rings, the intrinsic catalytic activity for hydrogenation of small size C=C alkene groups, for example, in styrene, should be comparable. Analysis of styrene hydrogenation in the batch reactor shows high activity of initial Pd/SiO

(TOF, 1,491 h
−1
) and comparable TOFs for the imprinted catalysts (883–1,053 h
−1
), confirming that hydrogenation of the C=C group in styrene is independent of the size of template molecule and imprinted zones (Supplementary 
).
The substantial decrease in the intrinsic activities for hydrogenation of all molecules after imprinting could be explained by the electronic effects of DMAPA over surface palladium sites. Adsorbed DMAPA donates electron density to the surface Pd atoms and decreases the intrinsic activity. The electronic effect could result in an increase in the activation energy for the hydrogenation of molecules in the imprinted areas. Indeed, measuring toluene hydrogenation at different temperatures over the Pd/SiO

and TL-Print-Pd/SiO

catalysts shows an increase in the apparent activation energy from 38.2 to 67.0 kJ mol
−1
after the imprinting (Supplementary 
). The presence of electronic effects is also consistent with the decrease in the intrinsic activity for styrene hydrogenation after DMAPA poisoning (Supplementary 
)

. It has been reported

that the effect of electronic donors is less important over large metal particles. To test this assumption, palladium sponge with low surface area and dispersion (0.58%, determined by CO-pulse adsorption) was used for imprinting instead of the Pd/SiO

catalyst. The TOFs of toluene, mesitylene and TPB hydrogenation over the parent sponge were 25.67, 14.26 and 9.79 h
−1
, respectively, which is about three times lower than with the Pd/SiO

catalyst and could be explained by higher activity of defect palladium sites present in smaller palladium nanoparticles used for hydrogenation

. Different from imprinted Pd/SiO

, the TOFs over imprinted palladium sponge were calculated on the basis of the total number of palladium surface sites, including those that had been poisoned by DMAPA 
).
Imprinting of palladium sponge by toluene results in a high TOF of toluene hydrogenation (15.86 h
−1
), but negligibly low intrinsic activities for mesitylene (0.79 h
−1
) and TPB (0.70 h
−1
) hydrogenation. The same effect was observed over ML-Print-Pd sponge, which resulted in high activity for hydrogenation of toluene (18.26 h
−1
) and mesitylene (3.82 h
−1
) but a low TOF for hydrogenation of TPB (1.28 h
−1
). Imprinting by TPB demonstrates high activity: 20.10, 6.01 and 4.65 h
−1
for toluene, mesitylene and TPB, respectively. Thus, the imprinting phenomena, which introduce size and shape-selective hydrogenation, are similar on both palladium sponge and imprinted Pd/SiO

. Palladium sponge possesses higher numbers of terrace sites and fewer edges and corners than Pd/SiO

. It should result in higher amounts of adsorbed template molecules over continuous sites and higher quality of imprinted zones. Based on the total number of surface palladium sites, the overall activity (measured by TOF) is reduced less after DMAPA poisoning of the metal surface of the sponge in comparison with Pd/SiO

(Supplementary 
). This effect can be explained by both the lower electronic effect and the higher proportion of continuous palladium sites on the sponge in comparison with highly dispersed supported palladium catalysts.
Selective hydrogenation of benzene in the mixture
Our results suggest that this molecular imprinting methodology can be efficiently used for selective catalytic reactions. Control of selectivity is achieved by creating an active island on the metallic surface via adsorption–desorption of the template molecules and poisoning. We demonstrate further that this concept opens perspectives for practical applications; for example, for selective removal of benzene from a mixture of aromatics. Benzene is a carcinogenic compound and its content has to be reduced to less than 1% in gasoline

. Traditionally, benzene is removed by adsorption, catalytic hydrogenation and catalytic alkylation

,

. The adsorption process for benzene removal suffers from the limitation of the adsorption volume of adsorbents (for example, activated carbon). Catalytic alkylation consumes a large number of expensive olefins. Thus, catalytic hydrogenation could be considered a promising methodology

. However, hydrogenation of the mixture of aromatics not only hydrogenates benzene but also hydrogenates other molecules. Therefore, a smart catalyst that could selectively hydrogenate benzene in a complex mixture of aromatics would be highly desirable.
The imprinted Pd/SiO

catalyst was prepared by using benzene as a template and named Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

. The amount of DMAPA over the Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

catalyst was 0.145 mmol g
−1
determined by TGA, while the amount of bare palladium sites determined by H

adsorption was 0.054 mmol g
−1
(Supplementary 
and Supplementary 
). The TOFs for hydrogenation of various aromatics, such as benzene, toluene,
p
-xylene and mesitylene, were measured for initial Pd/SiO

and Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

. As shown in 
, after imprinting with benzene, the TOF for benzene hydrogenation decreased from 125.54 to 7.97 h
−1
. Importantly, the TOFs for hydrogenation of toluene,
p
-xylene and mesitylene decreased several times more compared to benzene. These results show that Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

demonstrates preferential behaviour for hydrogenation of benzene in comparison with other aromatic molecules.

Subsequently, we performed hydrogenation of benzene in a mixture with other aromatic molecules (benzene/toluene, benzene/
p
-xylene and benzene/mesitylene). As shown in –d
, the selectivity of benzene hydrogenation over Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

catalyst was spectacularly enhanced in comparison with hydrogenation over Pd/SiO

. The hydrogenation selectivity depends on the size of the aromatic molecule. For example, due to the comparable sizes of benzene and toluene, the selectivity of benzene hydrogenation in the mixture with toluene demonstrates only about 10% difference (62.6% versus 73.4%) at full benzene conversion and aromatic conversions of 85.0% and 70.2% for Pd/SiO

and Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

, respectively. At the same time, the selectivity of benzene hydrogenation compared to
p
-xylene hydrogenation already notably increases for Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

(90.1%) compared with Pd/SiO

(73.4%). The difference in the selectivity increases much further for the benzene/mesitylene mixture from 75.8% for Pd/SiO

to almost 98.4% for Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

. The selectivity of benzene hydrogenation in a mixture with different aromatics is, therefore, a function of their molecular size.
Selective hydrogenation of other molecules of similar molecular size to benzene has also been tried. For example, hydrogenation of pyridine mixed with mesitylene has been performed over both initial Pd/SiO

and Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

catalysts. However, due to the strong interaction between pyridine and palladium, both catalysts (Pd/SiO

and Ben-Pd/SiO

) exhibited 100% selectivity for the pyridine hydrogenation, whereas mesitylene hydrogenation was almost completely suppressed (Supplementary 
). This could be explained by the higher basicity of pyridine in comparison with other aromatic molecules. Note that both initial Pd/SiO

and Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

catalysts show similar intrinsic catalytic activity for pyridine hydrogenation (134 versus 139 h
−1
, Supplementary 
).
The concentration effect of benzene in the mixture with aromatics was further investigated. The weight ratio of benzene to other aromatics decreased from 1 to 0.5 and then to 0.1 (Supplementary 
). The imprinted Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

catalyst exhibited high selectivity for benzene hydrogenation even at the lowest benzene concentration (Supplementary ,d,f
). These results demonstrate the potential application of these imprinted palladium catalysts for selective benzene removal from mixtures of different aromatics.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated a molecular imprinting strategy for enhancing the selectivity of chemical reactions catalysed by heterogeneous palladium metal catalysts. By using DMAPA as a poisoner and various aromatic molecules of different sizes, including toluene, mesitylene and TPB, as templates, we successfully prepared a series of imprinted palladium catalysts. The catalytic results demonstrate that these imprinted palladium catalysts have a size-dependent reactivity for the hydrogenation of aromatic molecules. Moreover, the imprinted palladium catalysts prepared with benzene as a template exhibited preferential hydrogenation of benzene in a mixture of aromatics. Our results prove the potential application of imprinted catalysts for selective removal of carcinogenic benzene from reformate gasoline. The molecular imprinting strategy that we describe not only provides a powerful way to design a selective catalytic surface but also offers an additional understanding of the phenomena occurring during adsorption and catalytic reactions on the metal surfaces.

Preparation
Pd/SiO

catalyst
The Pd (10 wt%)/SiO

catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. Typically, 2 g of SiO

was impregnated with 0.34 g PdCl

in aqueous solution. The prepared sample was aged at room temperature overnight and then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the catalyst was calcined at 550 °C for 6 h.
Imprinting over the Pd/SiO

catalyst
Pd/SiO

catalyst (200 mg) was first reduced with H

(10 ml min
−1
, all gas volumes at STP) at 200 °C for 3 h in a homemade fixed-bed reactor, and then cooled down to 80 °C for template adsorption and DMAPA poisoning. Template (benzene, toluene, mesitylene, TPB) was injected by syringe pump at 10 ml min
−1
into the N

flow under atmospheric pressure. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas. Then, the template-adsorbed palladium catalyst was poisoned by bubbling DMAPA liquid under 30 °C and atmospheric pressure with 1 ml min
−1
N

flow. Finally, the resulting catalyst was heated up to 150 °C in the H

flow (10 ml min
−1
) for 1 h to remove the template from the catalyst. The imprinted palladium catalysts were named Ben-Print-Pd/SiO

, TL-Print-Pd/SiO

, ML-Print-Pd/SiO

and TPB-Print-Pd/SiO

, representing benzene-, toluene-, mesitylene- and TPB-imprinted Pd/SiO

, respectively. To study the poisoning behaviour, Partial-D-Pd/SiO

and D-Pd/SiO

catalysts were prepared by poisoning with DMAPA in the same manner without adsorption of the template. While D-Pd/SiO

was poisoned for 30 min, Partial-D-Pd/SiO

was poisoned for 10 min in order to get a similar amount of DMAPA on the catalyst in comparison to the imprinted Pd/SiO

.
Regeneration of the palladium catalyst

) at 200 °C for 1 h. The resultant catalyst was named C350-D-Pd/SiO

.
Deposition of Pt atoms on the palladium catalysts
To graft Pt atoms on the palladium surface for STEM analysis, typically, 15 mg of Pt(acac)

was dissolved in 5 ml of toluene and placed in a 25 ml batch-reactor. Then, 50 mg of palladium catalyst was added to the reactor and pressurized with 5 bar of H

. The reactor was heated at 60 °C for 1 h with continuous stirring. After the reaction, the catalyst was washed with toluene three times and then dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. Before STEM analysis, the platinum-grafted palladium catalysts were calcined under air flow (10 ml min
−1
) at 200 °C for 3 h to remove the DMAPA molecules from the palladium surface.

The X-ray diffraction patterns

were recorded on a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer in Bragg–Brentano configuration with a 0.02° step size and 1 s step time. Cu K
α
radiation (40 kV and 30 mA) was used as the X-ray source. The crystalline phases were identified by comparing the diffraction patterns with those of the standard powder X-ray diffraction files (JCPDS). The average crystal size was calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation.
TEM

,

,

analysis was carried out on a JEOL 2100 FEG S/TEM microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a spherical aberration probe corrector. Before analysis, the samples were dispersed in ethanol and deposited on a holey carbon-coated TEM grid. In STEM, the images were recorded using an HAADF detector with inner and outer diameters of about 73 and 194 mrad. EDS analyses allowing the elemental mapping of Pd and Pt were performed in the S/TEM using a JEOL Silicon Drift Detector (DrySD60GV, sensor size 60 mm

) with a solid angle of approximately 0.6 srad.

FTIR

,

,

spectra were recorded using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet 6700 FTIR (32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm
−1
) equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride detector. A self-supported wafer of palladium catalyst (diameter, 13 mm, 50 mg catalyst) was reduced under pure H

at 200 °C for 1 h, evacuated for 15 h (<10
−5
torr) and subsequently cooled to 80 °C for adsorption of template and DMAPA.
The Pt L

-edge XAS

was performed at the SuperXAS beamline at the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland). The incident beam was provided by a 2.9 T super-bent source. The beam was collimated by a rhodium-coated mirror at 2.5 mrad. Energy was selected by a Si channel-cut monochromator working in step-by-step mode. Focusing down to 200 × 500 μm was done by a toroidal rhodium-coated mirror at 2.5 mrad. Monochromator energy was calibrated for each sample using platinum foil (11.564 keV) measured simultaneously with each sample. The catalysts were loaded in quartz capillaries in a glovebox. The fluorescence signal was measured with a five-element silicon drift detector. The PtO

reference was measured in transmission mode as a pellet diluted with cellulose. Three 15-cm-long ionization chambers filled with N

at 2 bar were used to monitor the incident beam intensity, transmission through the sample and the reference platinum foil. All XAS data were further analysed using Demeter software. The
k

-weighted EXAFS spectra were fitted in
R
space in the
k
range of 3–13.2 Å and
R
