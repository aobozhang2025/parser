synthesis of (a) Ru and (b) Co HT -SAs on CA -CNFs. Note that the single atom density for Co is much lower than Pt and Ru, which arises fro m the high vapor pressure of Co making it more volatile at high temperatures. (c) EANES profile of Co HT -SAs showing deviation from Co foil structure (Co -Co bond).
