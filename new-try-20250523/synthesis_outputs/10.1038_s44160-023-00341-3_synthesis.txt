Material synthesis. All reagents for the synthetic part of the work were purchased from commercial suppliers
and used directly without any further purification. Ni −nCN was prepared through a modified published
SA x
procedure.1–3 In brief, graphitic carbon nitride (gCN ) was first prepared using dicyanamide as a source of carbon
x
and nitrogen. In a typical experiment, dicyanamide (10 g) was placed in an alumina crucible and heated in air at
550 °C for 3 h, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. To prepare the nanosheets, gCN (750 mg) was thinly spread out
x
in the alumina combustion boat, making good contact with air, and then heated at 520 °C for 4.5 h, using a heating
rate of 2 °C min−1. A pale-yellow powdered material was obtained. The nanosheets of carbon nitride were used as
such as a photoactive support for the dispersion of the nickel single atoms. Specifically, Ni(NO ) ·6H O in
3 2 2
(Millipore) water (140 mg, 14 mL) was added dropwise to nCN (350 mg) and the resultant suspension was
x
sonicated for 30 min, and then left for 12 h under ambient conditions. Sodium borohydride (NaBH , 1.05 g) was

dissolved in Millipore water (5 mL) and was added dropwise to the stirring suspension. The mixture was stirred
for a further 12 h at 80 °C, followed by twenty runs (1 min each) of rapid microwave heating (LG, power 1000
W). The resultant solid was redispersed in Millipore water, filtered, washed with plenty of water and ethanol, and
left to dry in the oven at 55 °C for 3 h. The final material was denoted as “Ni −nCN ”, and its single site nature
SA x
was confirmed through in-depth characterization, in accordance with the published findings.
Material characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a PANalytical X’Pert
PRO MPD diffractometer equipped with an X’Celerator detector and with iron-filtered Co Kα (40 kV, 30 mA,
λ = 0.1789 nm) radiation. using a 0.01° s–1 (2θ) scanning speed. The angular range of measurement was set as
2θ = 5°–60°, with a step size of 0.01°. The Ni content was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) on an Agilent 7700x (Agilent, Japan). A weighted amount of sample from the catalyst
(0.01 mg) was digested in nitric acid using a microwave. Elemental C, N, and H analysis was accomplished by
combustion using a Vario Micro device. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were
obtained over a Titan G2 60-300 microscope (FEI), equipped with an X-FEG-type emission gun operating at
300 kV. High-angle annular dark-field detector (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)

analysis was conducted over a Titan G2 60-300 microscope (FEI), equipped with HAADF detector 3000
(Fishione). Nitrogen physisorption was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 3020 instrument (Micromeritics,
Atlanta) at −196 °C. Before the measurement, the samples (ca. 20–40 mesh) were degassed at 150 °C for 24 h.
The specific surface area was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using the adsorption
branch in the p/p range of 0.05–0.35. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out in

a custom-designed UHV system working at the base pressure of 1×10–9 mbar and equipped with an electron
analyzer (EA125 Omicron) and an X-ray source (DAR400 Omicron). The powder samples were suspended in
methanol and drop-cast on metal support to obtain a homogeneous film. Once dried, the sample was introduced in
an ultrahigh-vacuum system and left outgassing overnight. Photoemission spectra were acquired at room
temperature in normal emission. The spectra were analyzed using the XPSPEAK software using Voigt functions
and subtracting a Shirley background. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ni K edge was recorded at the
SuperXAS beamline of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland). Measurements were
performed ex situ in transmission mode on pellets, and a Ni foil was measured simultaneously for absolute energy
calibration. The quick-EXAFS (QEXAFS) method was used to collect 100 spectra in 100 s, which were then
merged. Athena and Artemis from the Demeter software package were used for data analysis.4 The fit of the
EXAFS spectra was performed by using, for the path description, a structure in which Ni is hosted in a dicarbon
vacancy in carbon nitride, following an approach already employed for a Cu single-atom catalyst.5 The amplitude
reduction factor was calculated from EXAFS fits of the NiO reference material. The infrared (IR) spectra were
acquired in diffuse reflectance mode (DRIFT) using a Bruker Vector 22 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a
Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride detector. Before starting the IR experiments, 100 µL of a 0.2 M water solution of
pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid were deposited on 20 mg of catalyst powder. Subsequently, the powder was dried at
room temperature for 6 h. Each spectrum was collected by averaging 128 acquisitions at 2 cm−1 spectral resolution.
The reflectance data were successively converted in pseudo-absorbance (i.e., A = -log R, where R is the measured
reflectance).
Photocatalytic experiments. Ni −nCN (5 mg), N-Boc-L-proline (0.45 mmol, 1.5 equiv), K CO (0.6 mmol,
SA x 2 3
2.0 equiv), solvent (3 mL), and a magnetic stirrer bar were transferred into a 4 mL vial equipped with a screw cap

rubber septum, which in-turn functioned as the batch photoreactor. The reaction mixture was degassed by bubbling
a N stream for 15 min at 0 °C. Then, 1-bromo-3-phenylpropane (0.30 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added dropwise into

the solution. Photocatalytic batch experiments were carried out using a PhotoCubeTM reactor (ThalesNano Inc.),
and an irradiation time of 8 h (unless otherwise stated). The preliminary product analysis was conducted using 1H
and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Essentially, the reaction mixture was filtered through a PTFE syringe filter (0.45 µm)
and concentrated in vacuo; 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis were performed on a Bruker DPX 400
spectrometer at 298 K. To quantify the conversion of the limiting reagent (i.e., the 1-bromo-3-phenylpropane)
after the reaction, a 30 µL aliquot of the solution was taken from the batch photoreactor and diluted with 2.97 mL
of MeCN, filtered, and then analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Conversion of 1-
bromo-3-phenylpropane was deduced using an Agilent 1200 instrument, with an ultraviolet-visible detector
(G1315D) set at 210 nm. Samples and standards (5 µL) were injected directly onto a 250 mm × 4.6 mm Hypersil
GOLD™ aQ 5 µm 175 Å column purchased from Thermo Scientific. The mobile phase was comprised of a 60/40
MeCN/H O mixture with a total flow rate of 0.7 mL min−1 at 40 °C. When conducting the analysis, one hour of

equilibration was required before the first sample injection. Initially, 1-bromo-3-phenylpropane was analyzed in
isolation, to identify the respective retention time on the chromatogram (N-Boc-L-proline was not visible at the
available detection wavelength). A standard calibration curve of 1-bromo-3-phenylpropane (i.e., the limiting
reagent) was produced (Supplementary Information, ); this allowed for the concentration of alkyl halide in
the reaction aliquot to be deduced, and hence, for the starting material conversion and reaction rate to be computed.
It should be noted that this analytical protocol was implemented based on the observation that the
metallaphotocatalysed reaction led to the generation of a sole product, i.e. the corresponding ester.
For the substrate scope, purification of the crude product was afforded through an extraction process, in which
ethyl acetate (15 mL 3) and water (15 mL) were employed. Organic solutions were collected and concentrated
under reduced pressure on a Büchi rotary evaporator using a water bath.
For experiments invoking the use of alternative catalytic systems, the same reaction vial (with 1-bromo-3-
phenylpropane as the alkyl halide) was adopted, as previously described, but the following quantities of the
homogeneous photocatalyst and/or homogeneous nickel catalyst (plus ligating agent) were employed:
Ir[dF(CF )ppy] (dtbbpy)PF (0.02 equiv), NiCl •glyme (0.1 equiv), 4,4´-di-methoxy-2,2´-bipyridyl (0.1 equiv), in
3 2 6 2

accordance with the published procedure.6,7 For the semi-heterogeneous system involving gCN , 5 mg of the
x
photocatalyst was used and the aforementioned quantities of the homogeneous nickel catalyst (plus ligating agent).
For the recovery and reutilization of the catalyst, after completion of the reaction involving 1-bromo-3-
phenylpropane, the mixture was first filtered through a Millipore filtration setup (using a 0.45 µm PTFE membrane
filter). The recovered material was then rinsed under vacuum with water and acetone, and dried overnight at 45 °C.
Theoretical calculations. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the VASP
code.8,9 H(1s), C(2s,2p), N(2s,2p), Br(4s,4p), and Ni(3d,4s) electrons were treated explicitly, and the interaction
between the inner electrons and the nuclei was treated with the Projector Augmented Wave method.10,11 The
exchange-correlation functional proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) was adopted.12 In some cases
(vide infra), single point calculations on top of PBE results were done with the hybrid functional HSE06 to improve
the electronic structure description.13,14 The long-range dispersion was added to the potential according to
Grimme’s DFT+D3 scheme with a Becke-Johnson damping function.15,16 Structure relaxations were performed at
the  point with a cutoff of 400 eV recurring to a conjugated gradient algorithm. Spin-polarization effects were
included in all calculations. Dipole and quadrupole corrections to the total energy were applied along the non-
periodic direction for all calculations on slab models. A vacuum region of at least 1.5 nm was included along the
non-periodic direction in the supercell, to avoid spurious interactions between a replica of the slab models. The
carbon nitride nanosheets have been modelled assuming a corrugated heptazine structure.5,17–19 Gibbs free energy
profiles have been determined by adopting the computational approach pioneered by Nørskov and co-workers,20,21
to study reactions involving gas-phase molecules,22–27 where we added the standard entropies of gas species to the
calculated DFT energies. The entropy of all gas species involved in the reaction cycle have been taken from the
literature.28
