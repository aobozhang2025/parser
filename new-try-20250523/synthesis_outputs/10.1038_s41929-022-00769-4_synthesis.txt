Synthesis of Hydrogenated N-heterocycles
The Synthesis of Dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole (DNEC). The synthesis was carried out in a
batch-mode high-pressure autoclave (100 mL), using homemade Ru NPs as the hydrogenation
catalyst. In a typical batch, 25 g N-ethylcarbazole (Alfa Aesar) and 1.5 g Ru NPs catalysts were
mixed and sealed within the autoclave. After several times of hydrogen filling and evacuation
treatments, the autoclave was filled with 7 MPa H at 160 oC and the hydrogenation reaction was

kept under such condition for 12 h. After the reaction, the liquid product was separated from Ru
NPs catalysts via centrifugation.
The Synthesis of Tetrahydro-N-ethylcarbazole (TNEC). In a typical synthesis, a three-necked,
round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a condenser was charged with poly
(ethylene glycol) (1000 mL), toluene (2000 mL), tetrahydro-carbazole (85.62 g, 0.500 mol)
and sodium hydroxide aqueous (1000 mL, 1 N, 1.000 mol). Bromoethane (56.0 mL, 0.750 mol)
was added dropwise to the mixture over a period of 30 min, then the reaction mixture was slowly
warmed to 100 oC and held for 6 hours at 95 – 105 oC under nitrogen atmosphere with stirring.
The mixture was separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 * 330 mL).
The organic phase mixture was washed with brine (500 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate
(20 g), concentrated in vacuum, and the residue was purification by flash column chromatography

(330 g silica gel, gradient elution, 0% – 95% ethyl acetate in b.p. 60 – 90 oC petroleum ether, 200
mL/min, 60 minutes). The appropriate solution was evaporated under reduced procedure to
provide TNEC (40.168 g, 39%) as a light-yellow liquid.
The high-purity of DNEC and TNEC was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (NMR, Bruker-500 MHz) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-Mass,
Agilent 7890A-5975C GC-MASS), the 1H NMR spectra of DNEC, TNEC and NEC were shown
in Supplementary 
spectrum, (d) EELS-mapping image. The spatial distributions of sp2-C and sp3-C species in ND
were presented in red and blue colors in (d) respectively.

The calculated CO adsorption energies (DE ) and stretching frequencies (w) over different

supported Pd structures are summarized in Supplementary 

change the vibrational frequency. In addition, the change in the local bonding configuration of the
Pd species on the support surface, e.g., Entry 1 and 3, also affects the vibrational frequency.

Therefore, we propose that the experimentally observed dual CO peaks (2120, 2080 cm-1) are
possibly composed of overlapped different Pd -CO species of similar configurations, and could be

assigned to the CO adsorbed on Pd site with different configurations and/or with nearby OH

groups. The calculated bound CO vibrational frequencies for the cluster model (Pd ) are in line

with experimental observation.
