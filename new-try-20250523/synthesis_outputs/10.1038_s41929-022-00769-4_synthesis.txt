Methods Synthesis of Hydrogenated N-heterocycles The Synthesis of Dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole (DNEC). The synthesis was carried out in a batch-mode high-pressure autoclave (100 mL), using homemade Ru NPs as the hydrogenation catalyst. In a typical batch, 25 g N-ethylcarbazole (Alfa Aesar) and 1.5 g Ru NPs catalysts were mixed and sealed within the autoclave. After several times of hydrogen filling and evacuation treatments, the autoclave was filled with 7 MPa H2 at 160 oC and the hydrogenation reaction was kept under such condition for 12 h. After the reaction, the liquid product was separated from Ru NPs catalysts via centrifugation. The Synthesis of Tetrahydro-N-ethylcarbazole (TNEC). In a typical synthesis, a three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a condenser was charged with poly (ethylene glycol) (1000 mL), toluene (2000 mL), tetrahydro-carbazole (85.62 g, 0.500 mol) and sodium hydroxide aqueous (1000 mL, 1 N, 1.000 mol). Bromoethane (56.0 mL, 0.750 mol) was added dropwise to the mixture over a period of 30 min, then the reaction mixture was slowly warmed to 100 oC and held for 6 hours at 95 â€“ 105 oC under nitrogen atmosphere with stirring. The mixture was separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 * 330 mL). The organic phase mixture was washed with brine (500 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (20 g), concentrated in vacuum, and the residue was purification by flash column chromatography
