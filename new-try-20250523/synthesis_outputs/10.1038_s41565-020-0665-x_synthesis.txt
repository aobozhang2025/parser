To further verify the atomic dispersion of Rh species in SA-Rh/CN and explore their precise coordination structure, X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) was carried out. Extended XAFS (EXAFS) Fourier transforms (FTs) are shown in

and slightly larger than the Rh–O peak at ~1.45 Å for the RhO

octahedra in Rh(acac)

; this can thus be attributed to a mixture of Rh–N and Rh–O bonding. In addition, FT of SA-Rh/CN reveals a minor signal at ~2.09 Å that is much shorter than the Rh–Rh peak at ~2.38 Å for Rh bulk, which indicates atomic dispersion of the Rh species. To more clearly discriminate the coordination atoms in the Rh species, EXAFS wavelet transform analysis was carried out

is detected in SA-Rh/CN, not only confirming that the Rh metals exist as mononuclear centres without the presence of metal-derived crystalline structures in SA-Rh/CN, but also validating the assignment of the major peak at ~1.48 Å to Rh–N/O bonding 
). Subsequently, least-squares EXAFS curve-fitting analysis was used to extract quantitative structural results for the Rh moiety in SA-Rh/CN 
, Supplementary Figs.

and Supplementary 
). The coordination number of the N/O atoms in the first coordination sphere of Rh was estimated to be 6.3 at distance of 2.05 Å, indicating an octahedral configuration for the Rh–N/O bonding. Meanwhile, a second coordination sphere of C atoms was shown at 2.78 Å with a coordination number of 3.6. This is in marked contrast to the porphyrinic-N-based moiety, where the number of C atoms in the second coordination sphere is expected to be larger than 10 but is similar to the pyridinic-N-based and MN

. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, which has a higher sensitivity to the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of atoms around the photo-absorber, was applied to better identify the atomic-site structures. The Rh K-edge XANES spectrum of SA-Rh/CN is shown in

]Cl

and Rh(acac)

, indicating that the Rh valence state is close to +3, consistent with the results obtained from XPS spectra. A variety of structure models were established by DFT calculations to identify the specific structure of SA-Rh/CN via a comparison of the simulated XANES spectra of the model Rh-N
x
moieties with the experimental spectrum. We found that the XANES profile of SA-Rh/CN can be reproduced fairly well by the structure of a Rh-N

moiety embedded in a minimized graphene sheet with two axial oxygen molecules 
), and the interatomic distances predicted by DFT are fully consistent with the structural parameters determined by EXAFS fitting (Supplementary 
). However, some obvious discrepancies are presented when the Rh-N

moiety is embedded in an extended graphene sheet (Supplementary 
). Therefore, the combination of EXAFS and XANES analyses has unambiguously revealed the mononuclear dispersion of the Rh species in a largely defective graphene sheet in SA-Rh/CN, which is also consistent with Raman spectra.

Rh plays a substantial role in catalysis

,

,

,

, but it seems that traditional Rh materials are not optimal catalysts for FOR

,

, so it was surprising when we found that SA-Rh/CN exhibits an unexpected catalytic performance for FOR. ,
Supplementary 
and Supplementary 
show that SA-Rh/CN demonstrates a highest mass activity of 16.1 A mg
−1
, which is respectively ~28, 67 and 805 times larger than the values found for Pd/C (0.57 A mg
−1
), Pt/C (0.24 A mg
−1
) and Rh/C (0.02 A mg
−1
) 
). Notably, SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN (synthesized by the same procedure; for characterizations see Supplementary Figs.

–

and Supplementary 
) are inert towards FOR. In cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves obtained under the same conditions as used for SA-Rh/CN, we can only see the signal of the electrical double layer (Supplementary Figs.

and

). Moreover, the mass activity of SA-Rh/CN is sevenfold higher than that of Pd/C at 0.25 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE); with increasing potential, this mass activity increases to up to 46-fold higher than for Pd/C (Supplementary Figs.

and Supplementary 
). The turnover frequency (TOF) of SA-Rh/CN (8.55 s
−1
) is nine times higher than that of Pd/C (0.92 s
−1
; Supplementary 
). To explore the reasons for the lower current in the negative scan, we changed the scan range of the CV test (Supplementary Figs.

and

). The results, combined with in situ XANES spectra (Supplementary 
), suggest that the oxidation state of the Rh atoms becomes higher and can be attributed to the formation of oxides during the reaction at high potentials. However, during scans under standard conditions, SA-Rh/CN recovers in the anodic scan of the second cycle (Supplementary 
), suggesting that the oxidation species has recovered to its initial state.

The stability test was performed using chronoamperometry (CA) and an accelerated durability test (ADT). The CV curve of SA-Rh/CN is almost unchanged after 50,000 s of the CA test (Supplementary 
). With ADT, the CVs after the first 20,000 cycles show the excellent durability of SA-Rh/CN (44.4 h, almost unchanged; Supplementary 
). In the next 10,000 cycles, SA-Rh/CN loses only 11% of its mass activity (66.7 h; 14.3 A mg
−1
). By contrast, commercial Pd/C suffers a huge loss of 72% after the first 1,000 s of the CA test and is almost deactivated after 1,500 cycles (3 h) of ADT 
and Supplementary Figs.
42b
and
43b
). The CA curves for different rotation rates of SA-Rh/CN are almost identical, indicating that there is less mass transfer effect in FOR (Supplementary 
). Characterizations of SA-Rh/CN after the CA test (denoted SA-Rh/CN-af) indicate that SA-Rh/CN has maintained its rhombic dodecahedron morphology and the Rh atoms have retained their atomic distributions (Supplementary Figs.

).
Zn plays a vital role in the formation of SA-Rh/CN: first, tetrahedral coordinated Zn ions bridged by 2-methylimidazole constitute the skeleton of ZIF-8; second, during pyrolysis, Zn ion sites are substituted by Rh atoms to form SA-Rh/CN. We detected 6.82 wt% Zn in SA-Rh/CN, which is a huge amount—seven times higher than the metal loading of Rh, which is determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (detailed ICP-OES measurements are provided in the
Supplementary
Information). To explore the role of Zn in SA-Rh/CN, a series of control experiments were carried out. First, we extracted Rh atoms from SA-Rh/CN (to give CN) and prepared ZIF-8-derived CN (namely ZIF-8-C; characterizations are shown in Supplementary Figs.

and

). From CV curves of these two samples and ZIF-8, we observed that these samples are inert to FOR (Supplementary Figs.

–

). These results indicate that the Rh atoms play a key role in FOR. Subsequently, Rh/ZIF-8 with different pyrolysed conditions was prepared (‘Rh/CN-different conditions’; for details see

Methods
). The amount of Zn in these samples decreased from 12.47 wt% to 0.28 wt%, because the Zn vaporized under the high temperatures (Supplementary 
). Characterizations of these samples are provided in Supplementary Figs.

–

and Supplementary 
. With vaporization of the Zn, the multi-point BET surface of Rh/CN increased from 790 to 1,339 m

g
−1
and the micropore volume of the Rh/CN increased from 0.310 to 0.550 cm

g
−1
. The other characterizations show no obvious differences. The mass activity of Rh/CN-2h (11.6 A mg
−1
) is much weaker than that of SA-Rh/CN (16.1 A mg
−1
). The mass activities of Rh/CN-4h (16.3 A mg
−1
), Rh/CN-5h (17.0 A mg
−1
) and Rh/CN-1100 (17.4 A mg
−1
) only exhibit a slight improvement (Supplementary 
). These results suggest that excessive Zn in Rh/CN blocks the micropores in Rh/CN and thus has a negative effect on the catalytic properties and a small amount of Zn has negligible effect on catalytic performance.
To evaluate the potential applications of SA-Rh/CN as an anode catalyst in DFAFCs, an integral fuel cell incorporated with SA-Rh/CN was assembled. SA-Rh/CN shows a high mass power density (522.1 mW mg
−1
; 
), which is 8.8-fold higher than that of commercial Pd/C at 30 °C (59.3 mW mg
−1
; Supplementary 
). SA-Rh/CN also displays high power densities of 1,086.9 and 1,241.9 mW mg
−1
at 60 °C and 80 °C, which are 14.8 and 14.1 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C (73.4 and 87.9 mW mg
−1
respectively). The fuel cell performances at a fixed dimension of SA-Rh/CN and Pd/C show that the power density of SA-Rh/CN is lower than that of Pd/C (Supplementary Figs.

and

), because the amount of precious metal in commercial Pd (30 wt%) is over 30 times higher than that in SA-Rh/CN (0.92 wt%). It is important to increase the metal loading of precious metal in SA-Rh/CN. Accordingly, a single cell test with Rh/CN-1100 (1.42 wt%) as anodic catalyst was performed. The power density of DFAFCs increases strikingly at 80 °C to 86.6 mW cm
−2
, which is approaching that of Pd/C (105.4 mW cm
−2
), although the metal loading of Pd/C is still 21.4 times higher than that of Rh/CN-1100 (Supplementary 
). Therefore, it is believed that single-atom Rh catalysts show tremendous potential in DFAFCs.
To explore the CO resistance of SA-Rh/CN, two different CO-stripping experiments were performed. ,b
presents CO resistance against saturated CO (for detailed procedures see

Methods
). With Rh/C, the oxidation of adsorbed CO (CO*) appears at 0.67 V with a steep peak, which is in agreement with previously reported work. To our surprise, SA-Rh/CN can oxidize CO* at a very low potential (0.08 V) with a tiny peak, which suggests that CO weakly adsorbs at the surface of SA-Rh/CN and can be oxidized easily. ,d
shows the CO resistance in a simulated cell arrangement (for detailed procedures see

Methods
). As for the curve for Rh/C, the CO* oxidation peak emerges at 0.63 V. However, no peak appears on the curve for SA-Rh/CN. These results indicate that SA-Rh/CN can inhibit the dehydration of formic acid, eliminating CO poisoning in DFAFCs and oxidizing formic acid towards direct dehydrogenation.

A series of experiments were carried out to explore the reaction mechanism. The Tafel slope (108 mV dec
−1
) of SA-Rh/CN indicates that C–H bond cleavage of HCOOH is the rate-determining step (Supplementary 
)

. When we use DCOOH instead of HCOOH in electrolyte, the mass activity of SA-Rh/CN shows a huge drop to 9.8 A mg
−1
, confirming the results of the Tafel slope analysis (Supplementary 
)

. No signals of intermediates are observed in in situ Fourier-transform infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (in situ FTIR) and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR; Supplementary Figs.

and

).
DFT calculations
DFT calculations were carried out to further understand the mechanism of formic acid oxidation on SA-Rh/CN and its excellent CO tolerance. In 
and Supplementary 
, the free energy profiles of formic acid oxidation demonstrate that the indirect route is thermodynamically unfavourable, as an endothermic reaction energy of 0.28 eV is needed to produce the CO* and H

O
(aq)
. Cleavage of the C–O bond in HCOOH is difficult at the SA-Rh site, because a larger surface ensemble site is required

. In the formate route, two successive steps, HCOOH
(aq)
→ HCOO* → CO
2(g)
, are both thermodynamically favourable. The O–H bond in formic acid can be broken easily (Supplementary 
) in water solution

,

, and C–H cleavage of HCOO* with an activation energy of 0.68 eV is the rate-determining step (Supplementary 
), which is in good agreement with the results of Tafel slope analysis and kinetic isotope effects. As for the direct routes, the intermediate, COOH*, forms four hydrogen bonds with nearby water molecules, and its O–H bond is almost broken with a length of 1.63 Å. Although the formation of CO
2(g)
from COOH* is an endothermic step, it can be thermodynamically favourable at higher potential (
U
RHE
> 0.54 V; Supplementary 
). The rate-determining step is still the cleavage of the C–H bond of formic acid, with an activation barrier of 0.76 eV (Supplementary 
), which is higher than that of the C–H bond cleavage in the formate route. Overall, the formate route is more favourable than the direct route considering both thermodynamics and kinetics, especially at low potential. At high potential, the direct route can also be favourable in terms of thermodynamics.

To elucidate the excellent CO tolerance of SA-Rh/CN, formic acid decomposition to produce CO and the binding of CO were analysed and compared with a Rh nanoparticle. In 
, formic acid can adsorb on Rh through the carbonyl oxygen atom, with a large exothermic energy of −0.85 eV, whereas the HCOOH can only weakly adsorb on the SA-Rh site with an adsorption energy of −0.25 eV. The weak adsorption of formic acid at the SA-Rh site can be attributed to the downward shift of the
d
orbital below the Fermi level and the density of state (DOS) at the Fermi level being less than that on Rh (for more details see Supplementary 
). Importantly, the subsequent decomposition of HCOOH to produce CO on Rh occurs readily, with an activation barrier of only 0.52 eV. Meanwhile, on the SA-Rh site, the activation barrier to produce CO is as high as 1.68 eV and the reaction energy is endothermic by 1.08 eV, indicating that CO is difficult to generate on SA-Rh sites. On the other hand, CO binds much more strongly on Rh (
E
ads
(CO) = −2.21 eV) than on SA-Rh sites (
E
ads
(CO) = −0.99 eV), implying that the removal of CO on SA-Rh/CN, as long as it is produced, can be easily achieved compared with the Rh nanoparticle. Hence, the high barrier to produce CO and the relatively unfavourable binding with CO contribute to the excellent CO tolerance of SA-Rh/CN.
DFT calculations were also performed to explore the reactivity of SA-Rh/CN and the inertness of SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN. The DOS of a single Pd atom at the Fermi level is almost zero, and the closest occupied peak is ~1.5 eV below the Fermi level, suggesting the chemical inertness of the SA-Pd site (Supplementary 
). The adsorption energy of CO at the SA-Pd site is extremely small (
E
ads
(CO) = −0.13 eV), indicating the weak bonding with other intermediates in formic acid oxidation. The single Pt atom is similar to the single Pd atom in the DOS and adsorption of CO. Overall, the SA-Rh sites possess appropriate binding ability with intermediates, indicated by
E
ads
(CO) = −0.99 eV, and thus better overall activity, while the Rh surface binds intermediates too strongly, as indicated by
E
ads
(CO) = −2.21 eV, and both the SA-Pd and SA-Pt sites bind intermediates too weakly, indicated by
E
ads
(CO) = −0.13 eV.
Conclusions
In summary, we report a new type of electrocatalyst for FOR, namely isolated single-atom Rh anchored on N-doped carbon. This catalyst has properties that are completely different from those of its nanoparticle counterpart (Rh nanoparticles/C shows negligible activity toward formic acid oxidation). The SA-Rh/CN electrocatalyst exhibits excellent mass activity, 28- and 67-fold higher than that of state-of-the-art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively, but also high catalytic stability due to its excellent tolerance to CO poisoning and resistance to sinter. The single-cell test indicates its application potential in DFAFCs. The mechanism of formic acid oxidation on SA-Rh and its unique CO tolerance have been demonstrated by DFT calculations. This work suggests a possible direction for the development of new electrocatalysts.

XAFS data collection, analysis and modelling
XAFS measurements were carried out at the BL14W1 station in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, 3.5 GeV, 250 mA maximum, Si double crystals). The Rh K-edge spectra of SA-Rh/CN catalysts were collected in fluorescent mode using a seven-element Ge detector. Reference spectra were recorded in transmission mode using an ionization chamber. The XAFS raw data were background-subtracted, normalized and Fourier-transformed by standard procedures with the ATHENA program

. The energy-dependent exchange-correlation potential was calculated in the real Hedin–Lundqvist scheme, then the spectra were convoluted using a Lorentzian function with an energy-dependent width to account for the broadening due to the core-hole width and the final state width.

Saturated Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode (a saturated calomel electrode was used in the first CO-stripping test and ATR-IR experiment) and Pt wire (carbon rod) was used as the counter electrode (a carbon rod counter electrode produced the same results; Supplementary

Electrochemical in situ multi-stepped FTIR (MSFTIR) reflection spectroscopy measurements were conducted on a Nexus 870 spectrometer (Nicolet) equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT-A) detector. A particular infrared cell with a CaF

window was employed, and a thin layer (less than 10 mm) between the working electrode and CaF

window was required for in situ MSFTIR measurements

. The resulting spectra were calculated as follows:
$$\Delta {{R}}/{{R}} = (R\left( {E_{\rm{S}}} \right) - R\left( {E_{\rm{R}}} \right))/R(E_{\rm{R}})$$

where
R
(
E
S
) and
R
(
E

) are the single-beam spectra collected at study potential
E

and reference potential

, respectively.
ATR-IR experiment
The ATR-IR experiment was conducted using a spectrometer (Thermo Fisher NicoletTM 6700) equipped with an MCT detector at a resolution of 8 cm
−1
and a home-built single-reflection accessory (incident angle of 70°). All spectra are shown in absorbance units. A silicon prism with a thin layer of gold deposited on the reflecting plane (via a chemical method) was used as the working electrode. A glassy cell equipped with carbon paper as the counter electrode and reference electrode (SCE) was filled with electrolyte (saturated KCl aqueous solution). The infrared spectra were collected in an argon-saturated mixed solution of 0.5 M H

SO

and 0.5 M formic acid.
CO-stripping test
While maintaining the potential of the working electrode at −0.4 V, CO was bubbled slowly into 0.5 M H

SO

aqueous solution for 15 min to ensure the saturated adsorption of CO at the surface of the catalyst. To remove dissolved CO, nitrogen was purged into the electrolyte while the potential was kept at −0.4 V for another 15 min. CVs were then recorded. For the second CO-stripping experiment, a working electrode modified with SA-Rh/CN or Rh/C was introduced into 0.5 M H

SO

aqueous solution containing 0.5 M HCOOH at OCP to simulate a small container in the cell atmosphere. This was continued for 10 min to ensure maximum accumulation of CO
ad
from dehydration of the formic acid. The electrode was washed with deionized water three times to remove HCOOH and dissolved CO and transferred to an aqueous solution of only 0.5 M H

SO

, then CVs were recorded. The metal content of Rh (Pd, Pt) in the ink was analysed by ICP-OES (200 ml of catalyst ink; Supplementary 
).
The hydrogen adsorption–desorption peak was not visible in the CV curves (Supplementary 
) and there was no stark change when formic acid was present in the electrolyte (Supplementary 
). The hydrogen adsorption–desorption peak for Pd/C is shown in the CV curve in Supplementary 
.
Calculation of the the TOF value was based on the following formula

:
$$\begin{array}{rcl}{\mathrm{TOF}} &=& \frac{{{\mathrm{Reacted}}\;{\mathrm{HCOOH}}\;{\mathrm{molecules}}}}{{\left[ {\left( {{\mathrm{Active}}\;{\mathrm{metal}}\;{\mathrm{atoms}}} \right) \times \left( {{\mathrm{Reaction}}\;{\mathrm{time}}} \right)} \right]}}\\ &=& \frac{{\left[ {{\mathrm{Transferred}}\left( {{\mathrm{electrons}}} \right)} \right]}}{{\left[ {2 \times {{N}}_{\mathrm{A}} \times {\mathrm{mol}}\left( {{\mathrm{active}}\;{\mathrm{sites}}} \right) \times {\mathrm{Reaction}}\;{\mathrm{time}}} \right]}}\\ &=& \frac{{{\mathrm{Current}}\left( {\mathrm{A}} \right)}}{{\left[ {2 \times {{N}}_{\mathrm{A}} \times {{e}} \times {\mathrm{mol}}\left( {{\mathrm{Active}}\;{\mathrm{sites}}} \right)} \right]}}\end{array}$$

where
N
A
and
e
are the Avogadro constant and electron charge, respectively. All Rh atoms in SA-Rh/CN are counted as active sites to calculate the TOF value and the active sites of Pd/C are calculated by integrating the hydrogen adsorption–desorption peak (Supplementary 
).
Single cell test
We cooperated with the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to conduct the single cell test. An electrode membrane assembly (MEA) was prepared with SA-Rh/CN as the anode and 60 wt% Pt/C as the cathode. The catalyst powder was mixed with isopropyl alcohol, deionized water and 5 wt% Nafion solution to prepare the catalyst ink. The well-mixed catalyst ink was then sprayed onto the gas diffusion layer to fabricate the electrodes. The MEA was prepared by hot-pressing the anode and cathode electrode onto the two sides of Nafion 115 membrane (Du Pont) at 8 MPa and 130 °C for 120 s. The amount of catalyst on the anode or cathode of the MEA was 4.0 mg cm
−2
. The amounts of precious metal in the SA-Rh/CN and commercial Pd/C anode electrodes were 0.04 and 1.2 mg
metal
cm
−2
, respectively. The 25 cm

single cells were assembled in a fuel cells fixture (qCf FC 25, Baltic Fuel Cells Company) for cell testing. 3 M formic acid solution was fed to the anode at a rate of 5.0 ml min
−1
and humidified oxygen gas was fed to the cathode at 750 ml min
−1
. A fuel cell test system (Arbin Instruments Company) was used to obtain polarization and power density curves to determine the electrical performance of real DFAFCs at different temperatures. No back pressure or relative humidification was applied for measurements. Polarization at 30, 60 and 80 °C was recorded to evaluate the catalytic ability.
Computational details
Models
The carbon support in this study was modelled as a 4 × 4 graphene orthorhombic supercell with lattice parameters of
a
= 9.84 Å and
b
= 8.52 Å and a C–C bond length in the graphene sheet of 1.42 Å (containing 32 atoms). The graphene sheet was separated by a 13 Å vacuum in the direction perpendicular to the surface. For single-atom catalysts of SA-Rh, SA-Pd and SA-Pt, Rh-N

, Pd-N

and Pt-N

species were embedded in the graphene sheet, respectively, as shown in Supplementary –c
. All atoms were allowed to relax. The metal catalysts were modelled with facets of face-centred cubic metals. The optimized bulk lattice parameters (experimental values in parentheses) were 3.84 Å (3.80 Å) for Rh

. The calculations were implemented using periodic four-layer slabs repeated in a 3 × 3 surface unit cell with a 15 Å vacuum to separate the periodically repeated slabs (Supplementary 
). The bottom two layers were constrained at the bulk position and the top two layers with adsorbates were fully relaxed. To consider the effects of solvent (mainly water), several layers of water with a density of 1 g cm
−3
were placed above the surface and then ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with a time period of 20 ps were performed. The most stable structures were obtained by optimizing the low-energy structures in the AIMD simulations. All the structures of reaction intermediates with water layers were also determined by using AIMD simulations with a time period of 20 ps. On the Rh-N

-embedded graphene, the water layers contained 28 water molecules, as shown in Supplementary 
. Due to the large computational demands of running AIMD simulations, the solvent effects were only considered for the Rh-N

-embedded graphene sheet and the corresponding intermediates adsorbed at the SA-Rh site.
DFT calculations
All spin-polarized calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)

,

. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional was used for the exchange-correlation potential

, and the projected augmented wave (PAW) potential was used to describe the ion–electron interaction

. The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis was set to 400 eV. The graphene sheets with Rh and Pd single atoms and the metal facets were sampled using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh

. We also considered the van der Waals dispersion forces using the zero damping DFT-D3 method of Grimme

. All structures were optimized until the forces on each ion were smaller than 0.02 eV Å
−1
, and the convergence criterion for the energy was 10
−5
eV. The transition states of chemical reactions were located through the dimer minimum-mode method combined with a nudged elastic band (NEB) method

,

. All transition states were identified by vibration analysis. The Fermi softness (
S
F
), a spatially resolved descriptor of the surface reactivity of solid catalysts, was used in analysing the active sites, where
kT
was adopted as 0.10 eV (
).
The AIMD simulations were carried out in the canonical (NVT) ensemble using Nosé–Hoover thermostats

,

. All AIMD simulations were performed using VASP at 300 K with a time step of 1 fs.
Computational potentials
The adsorption energy at an active site in vacuum was calculated as
$$E_{{\mathrm{ads}}} = E\left( {{\mathrm{slab}} + {\mathrm{molecule}}} \right) + E\left( {{\mathrm{slab}}} \right)-E\left( {{\mathrm{molecule}}} \right)$$

where
E
(slab + molecule) and
E
(slab) are the energies of the surface with and without adsorbed molecules, respectively, and the
E
(molecule) is the energy of the molecule in the gas phase.
The adsorption of formic acid at the interface between water layers and catalyst surfaces was modelled by replacing one H

$$\begin{array}{ll}G_{{\mathrm{ads}}} =& G({\mathrm{HCOOH}}^ \ast + \left( {n-1} \right){\mathrm{H}}_2{\mathrm{O}}^ \ast ) + G\left( {{\mathrm{H}}_2{\mathrm{O}}_{({\mathrm{aq}})}} \right)-G\left( {{\mathrm{HCOOH}}_{({\mathrm{aq}})}} \right)\\&-G\left( {n{\mathrm{H}}_2{\mathrm{O}}^ \ast } \right)\end{array}$$

. Given the fact that searching the transition state using an explicit solvent model is still a challenge, the implicit solvent model, VASPsol

, was used to include the effects of solvent water on the activation energies of C–H bond cleavage in both formate and direct routes in Supplementary 
.
To include the electrochemical potential, the reaction free energy is calculated as
$$\Delta G\left( {U,{\mathrm{pH}},T} \right) = \Delta G^0 + \Delta G_U + \Delta G_{{\mathrm{pH}}}$$

where Δ
