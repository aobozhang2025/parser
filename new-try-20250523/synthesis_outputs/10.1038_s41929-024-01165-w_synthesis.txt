Synthesis of Co1/MC, Ni1/MC and Fe 1/MC catalyst s MC supported Co/Ni/Fe single atom site (SAS) catalyst s were prepared using a polymer carbonization method1. Br iefly, catechol (1.3 g, 12.0 mmol) , nano -fumed SiO 2 (2.0 g), Co(NO 3)2· 6H 2O (2.0 g, 7.0 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran ( 150 mL) were dissolved in a round bottom ﬂask (500 mL) and stirred for 6 hours under room temperature . After the removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation , the remaining powder was dried over night at 80 °C and then carbonized at 900 °C for 2 hours with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 under Ar atmosphere . After that, the powder was immersed in HF ( 40 wt%) solution at 60 °C for 72 hours to remove the soluble species and impurities . Finally , the solid was collected by filtration , washed with deionized water for 5 times, and then dried at 80 ° C under vacuum for 12 hours. The result ed sample was label ed as Co1/MC catalyst . For the Ni1/MC and Fe1/MC catalysts , Ni(NO 3)2· 6H 2O (2.0 g, 7.0 mmol) and Fe(NO 3)3·9H2O (2.8 g, 7.0 mmol) were used instead of Co(NO 3)2· 6H 2O, respectively. Synthesis of Pt1/MC catalyst MC supported Pt SAS catalyst was prepared using a wet impregnation method2. Briefly, MC (99 mg) and deionized water (20 m L) were mixed in a round bottom ﬂask (100 mL) and sonicated for 30 minutes . After the introduction of H2PtCl 6 aqueous solution (2.7 mg H2PtCl 6· 6H 2O in 5 ml H2O), the mixture was then dispersed by the ultrasonic treatment for another 1 hour and stirred vigorously for 12 hours . After the removal of water by rotary evaporation , the remaining powder , the remaining powder was dried over night at 80 °C and then carbonized at 600 °C for 3 hours with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 under Ar atmosphere . Finally , the solid was washed with deionized water and ethanol for 5 times, and then dried at 80 ° C under vacuum for 12 hours. The result ed sample was label ed as Pt1/MC catalyst . Synthesis of Pt1+Co1/MC catalyst Pt SAS and Co SAS separately disperse d catalyst was prepared following the same procedures as those of the Pt1/MC catalyst , in which 99 mg of Co 1/MC sample was used instead of the MC support . The result ed sample was label ed as Pt1+Co1/MC catalyst . Synthesis of Pt1Co/MC catalyst Pt SAS s decorated Co nanoparticles ( NPs) catalyst was prepared following the same procedures as those of the Pt/MC catalyst, in which Co(NO 3)2· 6H 2O (14.8 mg, 0.051 mmol ) was additionally introduced into the mixture of H2PtCl 6· 6H 2O aqueous solution (2.1 mg in 5 mL H 2O), deionized water (20 m L) and MC (96 mg). The result ed sample was label ed as Pt1Co/MC catalyst . Catalyst
