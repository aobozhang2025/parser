Synthesis of Co /MC, Ni /MC and Fe /MC catalysts
1 1 1
MC supported Co/Ni/Fe single atom site (SAS) catalysts were prepared using a polymer
carbonization method1. Briefly, catechol (1.3 g, 12.0 mmol), nano-fumed SiO (2.0 g),

Co(NO ) ·6H O (2.0 g, 7.0 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (150 mL) were dissolved in a round bottom
3 2 2
flask (500 mL) and stirred for 6 hours under room temperature. After the removal of the solvent
by rotary evaporation, the remaining powder was dried over night at 80 °C and then carbonized at
900 °C for 2 hours with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 under Ar atmosphere. After that, the powder
was immersed in HF (40 wt%) solution at 60 °C for 72 hours to remove the soluble species and
impurities. Finally, the solid was collected by filtration, washed with deionized water for 5 times,
and then dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 hours. The resulted sample was labeled as Co /MC

catalyst. For the Ni /MC and Fe /MC catalysts, Ni(NO ) ·6H O (2.0 g, 7.0 mmol) and
1 1 3 2 2
Fe(NO ) ·9H O (2.8 g, 7.0 mmol) were used instead of Co(NO ) ·6H O, respectively.

MC supported Pt SAS catalyst was prepared using a wet impregnation method2. Briefly, MC (99
mg) and deionized water (20 mL) were mixed in a round bottom flask (100 mL) and sonicated for
30 minutes. After the introduction of H PtCl aqueous solution (2.7 mg H PtCl ·6H O in 5 ml
2 6 2 6 2
H O), the mixture was then dispersed by the ultrasonic treatment for another 1 hour and stirred

vigorously for 12 hours. After the removal of water by rotary evaporation, the remaining powder,
the remaining powder was dried over night at 80 °C and then carbonized at 600 °C for 3 hours
with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 under Ar atmosphere. Finally, the solid was washed with
deionized water and ethanol for 5 times, and then dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 hours. The
resulted sample was labeled as Pt /MC catalyst.

Synthesis of Pt Co/MC catalyst
Pt SASs decorated Co nanoparticles (NPs) catalyst was prepared following the same procedures
as those of the Pt/MC catalyst, in which Co(NO ) ·6H O (14.8 mg, 0.051 mmol) was additionally
3 2 2
introduced into the mixture of H PtCl ·6H O aqueous solution (2.1 mg in 5 mL H O), deionized
2 6 2 2
water (20 mL) and MC (96 mg). The resulted sample was labeled as Pt Co/MC catalyst.

Catalyst characterization
The catalysts were characterized by N adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray

photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), aberration-corrected high-angle annular
dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM) and
inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) techniques. N adsorption-

desorption was measured using a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 at liquid nitrogen temperature. The
sample was degassed at 300 C under vacuum for 24 h before the analysis. The specific surface
areas were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model. The pore size distribution
was calculated using the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. XRD measurements were
conducted on an X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX-RC, Japan) and operated at 40 kV and 200 mA
with Cu Kα (λ=0.154 nm) radiation. The XPS measurements were carried out on an ESCAL Lab
220i-XL spectrometer at a pressure of ~3×10-9 mbar using Al Kα as the excitation source
(hν=1486.6 eV) and operated at 15 kV and 20 mA. The samples were protected from the air before
and during the XPS analysis. Specifically, the samples should be kept in the reducing atmosphere
after the carbonization, and then immediately transferred into the glove box where they could be
glued to the tape under the inert atmosphere. Finally, the analysis was conducted in a vacuum
pumped measurement chamber to prevent the samples from the air oxidation3. The XAFS spectra
(Co K-edge and Pt L -edge) were collected at 1W1B station in Beijing Synchrotron Radiation

Facility (BSRF). The storage rings of BSRF were operated at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of
250 mA. With Si double-crystal monochromator, the data collection was carried out in
transmission mode using an ionization chamber. The EXAFS data were processed according to
the standard procedures using the ATHENA module implemented in the IFEFFIT software
packages4. The k2-weighted EXAFS spectra were obtained by subtracting the post-edge
background from the overall absorption and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step.
Subsequently, k2-weighted χ(k) data of Co K-edge and Pt L -edge were Fourier transformed to real

(R) space using a han-ning windows (dk=1.0 Å-1) for separating the EXAFS contributions from
different coordination shells. To obtain the quantitative structural parameters around central atoms,
least-squares curve parameter fitting was performed using the ARTEMIS module of IFEFFIT
software packages5. X-ray emission spectrum (XES) was performed at beamline 4W1B of the
Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility, China. The storage ring runs 2.5 GeV electron with current
of 250 mA. A polychromatic beam (pink beam) with an incident X-ray energy of 10-18 keV was
used, and the photon flux was on the order of 1013 phs/s. The beam spot-size (FWHM) was focused
down to 50 μm by a polycapillary half-lens. The Kβ XES data were collected by means of a
compact von Hamos spectrometer based on a full-cylinder Si crystal. The dispersion axis was
perpendicular to the axis of the incident beam. The analyzer diffracted and focused the emitted
signal onto a position-sensitive detector. The 2D spectra were recorded using a Pilatus 100K

detector with a pixel size of 172×172 μm2. The XES raw data were processed by the standard
procedures using the DAWN package. TEM and HRTEM images were obtained using a JEOL
JEM-F200 electron microscope operated at 200 kV. Before the measurement, the catalyst was
suspended in ethanol, and transferred to a copper-grid-supported carbon film after the ultrasonic
treatment. The aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM and corresponding EDS elemental mapping
were acquired using an aberration-corrected JEM-ARM300F electron microscope operated at 300
kV. The contents of supported metals in the catalysts were determined by ICP.
Reaction analysis
The quantitative analysis of the products was conducted using a gas chromatography (GC, Agilent
6820) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and HP-5MS/HP-INNOWAX capillary
columns (0.25 mm in diameter, 30 m in length). Identification of the products and reactant was
performed using a GC-MS [Agilent 5977A, HP-5MS capillary column (0.25 mm in diameter, 30
m in length)] and by comparing the retention time to respective standards in GC traces. Biphenyl
was used as the internal standard to determine the selectivities of the products. Identification of
the products in the aqueous phase was conducted by 1H NMR analysis on a Bruker Avance III 400
HD with D O as the solvent. The carbon balances for the reaction was calculated using C
2 six-membered
balance that was relative to the six-carbon products. The C balances for the
ring six-membered ring
reaction were better than 95±3%. Mass balance was calculated using Supplementary Eq. 16. For
the calculations of turnover frequency (TOF), every metal atom was assumed to be the potential
active site, which is a reasonable and commonly used lower bound for the calculations.

The FE is the ratio of the number of electrons transferred for the formation of each product to the
total amount of electricity passing through the circuit. The FE for the products was calculated
using equation :

Yield rate was calculated using equation :

The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was evaluated in terms of the double-layer capacitance
(C ). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in 0.5 M H SO solution at different scan rates of
dl 2 4
10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40 mV s-1 in a potential window where no Faradaic process occurs (0.32 to
0.42 V vs. RHE for the Pt/MC, Pt+Co /MC and PtCo /MC catalysts, 0.33 to 0.43 V vs. RHE for
1 1
the PtCo/MC catalyst). The C was estimated by plotting the ∆j = (j − j ) at a certain potential
dl a c
(where j and j are the cathodic and anodic current densities, respectively) against the scan rate,
c a

in which the slope was twice that of C . Using the C of Pt/MC catalyst as the reference, the
dl dl
relative ECSA of each catalyst was determined.
Thermocatalytic reaction of guaiacol
The thermocatalytic reaction was carried out in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel reactor of 20 mL with
a magnetic stirrer. Guaiacol (0.2 mmol), PtCo /MC catalyst (1.0 mg), NaBH (1.0 mmol, if used)
1 4
and 5.0 mL of H SO solution (0.5 M) were loaded into the reactor. The reactor was sealed and
2 4
purged with N for three times to remove the air and subsequently charged with H (0.5 MPa, if
2 2
used). Then the reactor was placed in a magnetic heated stirrer at 25 oC. When the stirring was
started with a speed of 400 rpm, the reaction time was recorded. After the reaction, the gas was
released passing through CH Cl . The reaction mixture in the reactor was transferred into a
2 2
centrifuge tube. Then the reactor was washed with the CH Cl used for the gas filtration, which
2 2
was finally combined with the reaction mixture. After centrifugation, the catalyst was separated
from the reaction mixture. The quantitative analysis of the liquid products in the organic phase
was conducted using a GC (Agilent 6820) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and
HP-5MS capillary column (0.25 mm in diameter, 30 m in length). Identification of the products
and reactant was performed using a GC-MS [Agilent 5977A, HP-5MS capillary column (0.25 mm
in diameter, 30 m in length)] and by comparing the retention time to respective standards in GC
traces. Biphenyl was used as the internal standard to determine the conversions of substrates,
selectivities and yields of the products. Identification of the products in the aqueous phase was
conducted by 1H NMR analysis on a Bruker Avance III 400 HD with D O as the solvent. The

carbon balances for the reaction was calculated using C balance that was relative to
six-membered ring
the six-carbon products. The C balances for the reaction were better than 95±3%.

Integrated valorization of eucalyptus lignin
Extraction of the eucalyptus lignin was conducted according to a literature method7. In a typical
experiment, eucalyptus powder was added into a water-acetone solution and the mixture was
heated to 180 ℃ under Ar atmosphere for 1 hour. The mixture was cooled and filtered to obtain
lignin solution. The collected liquor was concentrated under vacuum and rapidly poured into the
stirring water. The crude lignin was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum. Then, the crude
lignin was dissolved in acetone-methanol solution and precipitated by the dropwise addition of the
lignin solution into the rapidly stirring diethyl ether. Finally, the lignin solid was collected by
filtration and freeze-dried under vacuum for 24 hours. The obtained lignin was then characterized
by 1H/13C 2D heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR analysis using Bruker
Avance III 500WB and Bruker Avance 600, as described in the previous studies8.
The catalytic reaction was performed in a batch reactor of Hastelloy C-276 (500 mL)9. Briefly,
eucalyptus lignin (2.00 g), La(OTf) (0.9 g), methanol (180 mL) and deionized water (0.45 mL)

were added into the reactor. The reactor was sealed and purged with Ar to remove the air at room
temperature. Then the reactor was heated to 270 ℃ with a stirring speed of 800 revolutions per
minute (rpm), and the reaction was maintained for 8 h at 270 ℃. After the reaction, the reactor
was immediately cooled to room temperature and the liquid product was concentrated under
vacuum. The product was purified on a silica-gel column with ethyl acetate/hexane as the solvent
(1:9, v/v). The total yield of guaiacol and syringol was 20.5 wt% and the mole ratio was 1.53:1.
The electrocatalytic reaction of the eucalyptus lignin-derived monomers was conducted using an
enlarged H-type cell (250 mL) with a similar electrode set-up (4 mg PtCo catalyst, a 22 cm2

carbon paper)10. Before the reaction, the electrolyte was bubbled with N for 30 min under a stirring

condition, and then 0.41 g mixture of guaiacol and syringol (mole ratio=1.53:1) was added into
200 mL H SO solution. The reaction was carried out for 15 hours at a working potential of -70
2 4
mV (vs. RHE) with a steady stream of N (30 mL min-1) and a stirring speed of 400 rpm under

room temperature. After the reaction, the products were collected and analyzed using the above
methods.
