, respectively, suggesting that Aza-CMP-Co exists as mononuclear metal centres after OER 
). Notably, the redox features and catalytic current density of Aza-CMP-Co are preserved after 400 CV scans in various electrolytes, revealing good stability of single-site cobalt toward OER under broad pH conditions (Supplementary

). The FT–IR features of the used Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) correspond to those of Aza-CMP-Co rather than those of pristine Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) in the sections marked 1, 2 and 3, implying a decrease in coordinated cobalt sites after catalysis 
). In summary, the dynamic evolution of the cobalt composition in Aza-CMP varied with metal site loading: with a relatively low metal loading, Aza-CMP-Co showed excellent structural stability while the increase in cobalt site loading to approximately 20 wt% (most SACs have a low metal content of <1 wt% (
)) resulted in distinct decomposition of cobalt sites owing to the high concentration of molecular cobalt in the confined local area. Additionally, the formation of oxide phases explains the lower TOFs of Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) compared with those of Aza-CMP-Co and the asymmetric redox peak in Supplementary

OER mechanistic insights
Oxygen evolution reaction under mild pH conditions generally suffers from low activity and high overpotential. Although Aza-CMP-Co catalysts exhibited good performance under near-neutral conditions compared with other reported systems, significant performance loss in terms of overpotential, onset potential, Tafel slopes and TOFs occurred when the alkaline electrolyte was exchanged for a mildly basic example. Molecularly well-defined Aza-CMP-Co catalysts, containing Co
2+
active sites on a regular CMP matrix, provide an excellent platform for mechanistic studies. Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) showed the highest geometric current density but suffered from active site decomposition during catalysis. In addition, because Aza-CMP-Co exhibited higher TOFs than those of Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) under basic and near-neutral conditions, the former was selected for kinetic studies. The level of oxygen electrochemically generated from the Aza-CMP-Co system was confirmed using a pressure transducer. Quantitative yields of Aza-CMP-Co were 98.8% in 1.0 M NaOH and 98.3% in 0.5 M NaBi, indicating that the accumulated charge passed through Aza-CMP-Co electrodes can be almost quantitatively consumed in OER (Supplementary 
). To confirm that the cobalt sites in Aza-CMP-Co induced OER activity, an EDTA treatment experiment was performed. The presence of a strongly chelating EDTA ligand in the solution resulted in detachment of Co ions from the coordination sites in Aza-CMP-Co

. As shown in Supplementary 
, the treated sample lost its redox features and OER activity. Thus, water oxidation currents were achieved by the coordinated cobalt sites in Aza-CMP-Co during catalysis.
Kinetics under aqueous conditions
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of Aza-CMP-Co/CP shows similar OER current densities under both stationary and rotating conditions, demonstrating efficient mass transport on the electrode surface during water oxidation, which is expected for 2D porous structures (Supplementary 
). Kinetic studies were conducted to understand OER catalysis by cobalt sites, and the performance gap, along with a wide range of pH conditions. The pH-dependent performance studies were conducted in NaOH solutions in the absence of buffer anions to investigate the proton–electron transfer process of cobalt active sites under alkaline conditions. The distinct electrochemical signal of the higher-valence cobalt states facilitates tracking and interpretation of the evolution of active cobalt sites during the OER cycle. CV and DPV performed at the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale were used to determine proton participation in the Co
2+/3+
and Co
3+/4+
redox and oxygen evolution processes 
). As illustrated on the Pourbaix diagram 
), the slope of the Co
2+/3+
redox was −117 mV pH
−1
, corresponding to a two-proton/one-electron transfer process (2H
+
/1e
−
). For the Co
3+/4+
redox couple, the slope was −63 mV pH
−1
, corresponding to a 1H
+
/1e

transfer process. Notably, these proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) features are consistent with those of reported molecular cobalt-based heterogeneous electrocatalysts

, and different from cobalt hydroxides under alkaline conditions (Supplementary Note

)

. The pH-dependence studies were also conducted under near-neutral conditions using either borate 
and Supplementary 
) or phosphate (Supplementary 
) buffer anions. As illustrated in the Pourbaix diagram, the redox potentials plotted in the pH 6.0–13.0 range are independent of the type of buffer anion

Density functional theory calculations were applied to verify the configuration of cobalt sites under different oxidation states. The functional choice was rationalized by screening several non-hybrid and hybrid functionals, and comparing the calculated results with experimental values (Supplementary Note

The O-H bond (or hydrogen bond) cleavage is clearly involved in the concerted solution atom–proton transfer (APT) process (Supplementary Note

), with the reaction exhibiting primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIE
H/D
> 1.5)

,

,

,

. Therefore, the KIE
H/D
of Aza-CMP-Co was determined to confirm the proton transfer process during the catalytic rate-determining step (RDS). The LSV of Aza-CMP-Co/CP in a 1.0 M NaOD D

O solution shows a lower current density compared with that in 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution 
). The corresponding KIE
H/D
values are <1.5 over the catalytic overpotential range 0.30–0.36 V. Meanwhile, consistent with LSV-derived results, KIEs measured by chronoamperometry were close to 1.4 within the overpotential range of 0.30–0.36 V under alkaline conditions. KIE values under alkaline conditions were further examined with different fractions of deuterium (n). As OD
–
concentration increased, the KIE kept increasing but always remained <1.5, indicating a secondary KIE where O-H bond cleavage may not be directly involved in the RDS (Supplementary 
). For near-neutral conditions, larger KIE
H/D
values (>1.8) could be determined in borate buffer over the catalytic overpotential range, demonstrating a primary KIE effect 
). The absence of primary KIE in Aza-CMP-Co suggested that, under alkaline conditions, O-H bond cleavage was not involved in the RDS and the decoupled ET process may be the RDS of OER. By contrast, a markedly different behaviour was observed for the cobalt hydroxide electrode (Supplementary Note

): a KIE value of ~2.4 was observed at the catalytic potential, suggesting that O-H bond cleavage is involved in the RDS under alkaline conditions.
To a certain extent, pH-dependent OER activity can reflect the concerted or non-concerted proton–electron transfer characteristic of the RDS

,

. Potential shifts at the catalytic current density of 2.0 mA cm
−2
were calculated to evaluate the pH-dependent OER activity of Aza-CMP-Co. Under near-neutral and alkaline conditions, the potentials of OER catalytic waves shifted with pH and slopes close to −59 mV pH
−1
were determined by linear fitting, indicating that Aza-CMP-Co exhibits negligible pH-dependent OER activities with a zero-order dependence on OH
−
concentration at the RHE scale ,g
)

. As shown in ,e
and Supplementary 
, the peak currents of Co
2+/3+
redox remained consistent under different pH conditions, suggesting that the number of reaction active sites in Aza-CMP-Co is not sensitive to changes in pH. The pH-independent OER activities and reaction active sites suggested that catalysis of OER by Aza-CMP-Co is a typical heterogeneous catalytic reaction in which the reaction rate depends on the number of active sites on the catalyst and catalytic driving forces, but not on reactant concentration

. Meanwhile, pH-independent activities and primary KIEs satisfy the behaviour of a concerted APT mechanism for Aza-CMP-Co under near-neutral conditions. However, the absence of primary KIEs suggested that a non-concerted proton–electron transfer RDS occurred for Aza-CMP-Co under alkaline conditions. Thus, the detailed proton–electron transfer processes of Aza-CMP-Co during OER were systematically studied.
Non-aqueous redox and quantitative CV analysis
The presence of Co
4+
is crucial for O-O bond formation

. To prove the occurrence of successive redox states in the system during OER, CV was performed in a non-aqueous electrolyte (acetonitrile) in which the concentration of the substrate (H

O, HO
−
) was considerably reduced. This suppressed OER allowed the electrochemical detection of higher-valent reactive intermediates

. As shown in 
and Supplementary 
, as-fabricated Aza-CMP shows no dominant redox peaks in both CV and DPV while several oxidation peaks are present in the voltammogram of Aza-CMP-Co cast onto CP under anhydrous conditions. The chemical potentials of these oxidations were determined using DPV 
). Oxidation peaks at 0.13 and 0.47 V were assigned to the sequential oxidations of Co
2+/3+
and Co
3+/4+
, respectively, while the peaks at 0.67 and 0.88 V, which were undetectable under aqueous conditions, could be attributed to successive PCET processes. Closely spaced redox couples are common in PCET steps of molecular species

. Aza-CMP-Co features four closely spaced redox couples from the 2+ oxidation state at a potential of 0.8 V. When water and NaOH were added to electrolyte, an apparent catalytic current was observed. The third and fourth redox peaks attributed to successive redox processes are immersed in the catalytic current when OER occurs 
). Since pH-independent activity and KIEs demonstrated the non-concerted proton–electron transfer characteristic of the RDS under alkaline conditions, one of the additional redox features may be attributed to the ET process of the RDS.
The experimental CV of Aza-CMP-Co was compared with theoretically expected CV behaviour based on a model with an irreversibly adsorbed monolayer of reactants attached to electrode surfaces. A complete mathematical description of electrochemical response equations is presented in Supplementary Note

. The CV of Aza-CMP-Co produces a good quantitative match with the prediction based on an irreversible monolayer adsorption model 
). For the Co
2+/3+
redox couple, the current–potential data calculated are shown by the points plotted in Supplementary 
. This plot is in excellent agreement with the experimental curve, indicating that Aza-CMP-Co could be treated as adsorbed cobalt monolayers (loading of 8.5 × 10
–9
mol cm
–2
) with nearly ideal Nernstian reaction properties, further corroborating the molecular nature of Aza-CMP-Co. Co
3+/4+
oxidation is an irreversible, one-step, one-electron reaction. With a transfer coefficient of 0.35 and loading of 8.5 × 10
–9
mol cm
–2
, the calculated and experimental voltammograms are similar in onset shape but significantly different after the peak current. Similarly, the calculated Co
4+/3+
reduction wave is consistent with the experimental result at potentials lower than the peak point. The current mismatch after Co
3+/4+
peak potential indicated that OER had been triggered by additional oxidized Co
4+
species (Supplementary 
). For OER current calculation at the foot of the wave area, the irreversible Co
4+
oxidation reaction is assumed to be the RDS for OER, and the formal potential of Co
4+
oxidation was obtained by DPV under non-aqueous conditions in 
, but with intrinsic limitations. As shown in 
, after all currents had been integrated, the calculated forward and backward scan currents matched well with the experimental CV. The electrochemical properties of the catalyst were evaluated using the above quantitative analysis, and the molecular nature of as-fabricated Aza-CMP-Co was examined based on an irreversible monolayer adsorption model. Electrochemical quantitative CV analysis provides a good way of proving the molecular features and uniformity of the chemical environment of the catalytic centre compared with other advanced physical characterization techniques; therefore, CV analysis should be considered, especially for so-called single-atom catalysts, to identify the homogeneity of redox species in a specific molecular structure before corresponding reaction mechanism studies are carried out.
pH-related nucleophilic attack
When the catalytically rate-limiting O-O bond formation involves the APT in the WNA pathway, the addition of an anion (such as phosphate, acetate or borate) as a proton acceptor significantly increases the water oxidation reaction rate

,

,

. To gain insight into the RDS intermediate states under different pH values, the role(s) of mediated APT in cobalt site-catalysed water oxidation was investigated by the addition of different concentrations of borate or phosphate under varying pH –d
and Supplementary 
; see

Methods
for definition of borate and phosphate reaction order, ρ
[borate]
and ρ
[phosphate]
). The diffusion-controlled solution APT process is influenced by the concentration of external anions in the electrolyte, and first-order reactions with respect to the anions are widely observed in catalyst-modified electrodes when the RDS of OER proceeds through the APT pathway 
)

,

,

,

. For borate buffer, the anion effect is absent at pH 11.0 and 13.3 but pronounced at pH 7.7 –d
). The ρ
[borate]
for the cobalt sites is approximately 0.5–0.7 over the entire catalytic potential range under pH 7.7 electrolyte. Similarly, ρ
[phosphate]
for cobalt sites is approximately 0.4–0.5 under pH 7.0 conditions (Supplementary 
). Considering the relatively small KIE
H/D
value under near-neutral conditions (~1.8) and the presence of nearby uncoordinated N sites in Aza-CMP, the solution APT process—combined with a second-coordination-sphere-involved proton transfer process—occurs at cobalt sites under neutral conditions

. However, the ρ
[borate]
values for pH 11.0 and 13.3, as well as the ρ
[phosphate]
values for pH 12.6, are close to zero over the entire catalytic potential range. By contrast, the reaction order with respect to phosphate (ρ
[phosphate]
) for cobalt hydroxide is calculated at ~0.4 under pH 12.6 conditions, indicating different reaction mechanisms from those of Aza-CMP-Co and closer involvement of anions in RDS (Supplementary 
). As the counterpart of anions, cations also show significant interactions with the active oxygenated intermediates generated in OER. Alkaline earth cations disturb the hydrogen bond network of water molecules

, thereby influencing the interaction with surface intermediates

,

,

,

. Meanwhile, cations possess different solvation strengths (Li
+
> Na
+
> K
+
). The kinetics associated with the nucleophilic attack of water on oxidized electrophilic species decreases with increasing solvation strength

. Because the cation effect is related to interaction of the cation with active oxygenated species, the oxidation behaviour of Aza-CMP-Co was studied by LSV in 1.0 M MOH (M, Li, Na and K) and 0.5 M MBi solutions. As shown in 
, for OER in borate buffers, activity decreased between alkaline cations K
+
and Li
+
, indicating the significant influence of the hydrogen bond network and solvation strength in a solution APT process. However, the catalytic performance of Aza-CMP-Co under alkaline pH is independent of cationic species 
and Supplementary 
). 
lists the kinetic features of Aza-CMP-Co under near-neutral and alkaline conditions. In addition to catalytic performance, many differences in catalytic kinetics were observed under different pH conditions (the OER mechanism under alkaline conditions is clarified in Supplementary Note

). Specifically, OER activities of Aza-CMP-Co clearly show dependency on anion concentration and cation species under near-neutral conditions, indicating that a solution APT process is the RDS. Under alkaline conditions, Co(OH)

—as reference material—is fully in line with the estimated behaviours in a solution APT process (Supplementary Note

). However, OER catalysed by Aza-CMP-Co exhibits completely different characteristics from the solution APT process under alkaline conditions: no such dependencies were observed, which means that the RDS is not influenced by an additional proton acceptor and varying solvation strength. The absence of KIEs for Aza-CMP-Co under alkaline conditions suggests that direct O-H bond cleavage is not involved in the RDS. Logically, increased anion concentration cannot accelerate OER because the proton transfer process is not involved in the RDS. If not directly from H

O/OH
–
molecules in the inner Helmholtz plane, then the O atom for O-O bond formation possibly originates from the adjacent pre-deprotonated H

O molecules (OH ligand) generated by the decoupled 2H
+
/1e
−
Co
2+/3+
redox. Therefore, the absence of solvation strength dependency under alkaline conditions is caused by the intramolecular hydroxyl transfer process in RDS 
). The combination of redox properties, absence of kinetic isotope effect (H/D), added anion and cation effect under basic conditions provides sufficient evidence that the intramolecular O-O bond formation pathway of Aza-CMP-Co is the RDS under alkaline catalytic conditions.

The OER is a sluggish reaction involving four-electron/proton transfer steps and multiple intermediates. The RDS of OER is often not definitive, because of experimental difficulties in establishing the operational reaction mechanism. Activation energy is dependent only on the intrinsic properties of the reaction pathway for a given catalyst. Therefore, to gain insights into intrinsic OER activity and explore the differences in cobalt sites in both alkaline and near-neutral OER catalysis, activation energy was measured in both NaOH and NaBi buffer solutions through temperature-controlled electrocatalysis (Supplementary Note

). As shown in ,c
, the OER activities of Aza-CMP-Co exhibit an exact temperature-dependent feature in both NaOH and NaBi solutions. The corresponding Arrhenius plots of the natural logarithm of current at various potentials (ln

Conclusions
In summary, single-site cobalt ions anchored on Aza-CMP served as active centres for OER. The resultant Aza-CMP-Co was highly efficient in catalysis of OER under both neutral and alkaline conditions, resulting in higher TOFs than those of state-of-the-art, material-based catalysts. Experimental and theoretical results based on this model catalyst, with well-defined catalytic single-site cobalt decoration, demonstrated that OER catalysed by a single cobalt site triggered a pH-controlled nucleophilic attack pathway. This transition of O-O bond formation pathways was controlled by PCET features of the pre-redox states—that is, p
K
a
of the Co
3+
intermediates. When the pH is higher than the p
K
a
value, electrochemically driven deprotonation results in the transport of an additional proton, which facilitates the IHNA pathway where the adjacent OH
−
attacks Co
4+
=O to form the O-O bond. As established through temperature-controlled experiments and DFT calculations, the IHNA pathway requires much lower activation energy compared with that of the intermolecular WNA pathway, further clarifying the origin of the significant performance loss in terms of overpotential, Tafel slopes and TOFs when the alkaline electrolyte is changed to a neutral electrolyte. The proposed facile strategy of fabricating heterogeneous molecular electrocatalysts and the series of OER kinetic studies, including pH-dependent effects, kinetic isotope effects, APT studies, quantitative cyclic voltammetry analysis, electrochemical activation energy measurements and theoretical calculations, can be extended to various transition-metal ions, unlocking opportunities for the investigation of heterogeneous molecular electrocatalytic systems.

−1
), supplied with a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Direct 8), was used in all experiments. CP substrate was purchased from a local company; prior to use, CP was sequentially ultrasonically cleaned in concentrated nitric acid, deionized water, ethanol and acetone for 20 min. All other reagents were commercially available and used as received. Organic solvents were of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification.

Synthesis of Aza-CMP
A total of 532.5 mg (1.875 mmol) of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine tetrahydrochloride in 15 ml of anhydrous DMF and 390 mg (1.25 mmol) of hexaketocyclohexane octahydrate in 5 ml of anhydrous DMF were mixed and refluxed for 48 h under Ar. The resulting dark-brown solid was purified via hot extraction with methanol for 48 h using a Soxhlet extractor, then dried under vacuum at 150 °C for 24 h. Protonation-assisted exfoliation of the as-prepared bulk polymer was performed according to the reported literature

. To summarize, Aza-CMP (100 mg) was dispersed in 100 ml of 12 M HCl, and the suspension was subjected to ultrasonication for 24 h. The mixture was diluted with deionized water and centrifuged at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 min to separate large aggregates. Exfoliated nanosheets were collected by filter (polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 45 μm) and washed thoroughly with water.

Synthesis of Aza-CMP-Co
Aza-CMP material was modified with Co
2+
using cobalt(II) acetate. Aza-CMP (20 mg) was immersed in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF and the suspension stirred for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere, with the gas bubbling through the solution. Next, 85 mg (1.5 eq. with respect to phenanthroline units) of cobalt(II) acetate was dissolved in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF under Ar. The Co solution was slowly added to the suspension under Ar, and the mixture was maintained in a dispersed state by ultrasonication for 8 h at room temperature. The solid was filtered and then washed with DMF, water, methanol and ethanol until the filtrate became colourless. Finally, the product was dried at 80 °C under vacuum conditions. Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) was fabricated via the same procedure while replacing the as-prepared bulk Aza-CMP with exfoliated Aza-CMP.
Physical characterization methods
Atomic force microscope techniques were performed in dynamic mode using a Cypher ES system operating at room temperature under ambient air conditions. A commercial Oxford probe (no. HQ-150-Au) was used with a nominal force constant of 8 N m
−1
. The surfaces used for AFM experiments were SiO

/Si. AFM images were processed using Gwyddion software. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) experiments were carried out using a low-temperature qPlus-equipped commercial Omicron LT-STM (Omcron LT-STM QPlus pre4) at 4.2 K. As-synthesized Aza-CMP was deposited on the pre-cleaned Au substrate by in situ thermal evaporation under ultra-high vacuum condition. The STM image was obtained at a sample bias of 0.2 V and a tunnelling current of 50 pA. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K with a Micromeritics 3Flex adsorption analyser. Samples were degassed in a vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method was applied to calculate specific surface areas. The NLDFT models were used to determine the porosity of samples in SAIEUS software. XRD studies were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance Power X-Ray Diffractometer (Cu–Kα radiation,
λ
= 1.5418 Å). The morphology and composition of the fabricated films were characterized using a Hitachi field-emission scanning electron microscope (Regulus 8230) and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector (Oxford Ultim EXTREME). HAADF–STEM images and EDX mapping were collected on a JEM ARM-200F and FEI Talos F200X field-emission transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Surface composition of electrode films was investigated using XPS on an ESCALAB Xi
+
(Thermo Scientific). Raman spectroscopy was measured using a DXR Microscope (Thermo Fisher) and FT–IR with a Nicolet 6700 Flex (Thermo Fisher). High-resolution, solid-state NMR (SS-NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer at Larmor frequency of 125.7 MHz using a 4 mm broadband cross-polarization magic angle-spinning (MAS) probe head. Alanine was used as an external reference (178 ppm)

. The MAS sample spinning rate was 8 kHz. Cross-polarization was applied at a contact pulse duration of 1 ms and recycle delay of 5 s. A total of 2,740 transients were needed for a good signal-to-noise ratio. The concentration of Co was measured using ICP–OES with a Thermo Scientific iCAP 6000 series instrument. Samples on electrodes were digested in 1 ml of aqua regia with ultrasonication in a closed vessel and then diluted ten times to make a sample solution. Co standard solutions were measured prior to sampling, to calibrate and obtain standard curves. Co concentrations were determined using four different wavelengths: 231.1, 235.3, 237.8 and 238.8 nm, with average concentrations obtained at different wavelengths taken for data evaluation. Faraday efficiency measurements were carried out with an Omega PXM409 pressure transducer and a laboratory-made H-cell. EXAFS measurements were carried out on samples at beamline 07A1 of Taiwan Light Source at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center. This beamline adopts a fixed-exit, double-crystal Si monochromator to provide X-ray energy in the range 5–23 keV. The end-station was equipped with three ionization chambers and a Lytle detector for transmission and fluorescence-mode X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The beam size of the X-ray used on samples was ~0.5 × 0.25 mm (H × V), with flux >1 × 1,010 photons s
−1
. XAFS Co K-edge readings were collected at this beamline. Data were collected in fluorescence mode using a Lytle detector, while the corresponding reference sample was collected in transmission mode. Samples were ground and uniformly daubed on special adhesive tape. Raw EXAFS data were analysed according to standard procedures with ATHENA software packages. Quantitative curve fittings were carried out in R space (1.0–3.0 Å) with a FT K-space range of 2.5–12 Å

Preparation of catalyst inks and film on the electrode
The catalyst was dispersed in a water/ethanol 1:1 solution to form an ink, which was prepared by immersion of 5 mg of catalyst in a solution containing 0.25 ml each of water and ethanol. The catalyst ink was transferred to an ultrasonic bath and sonicated for 60 min, then 10 μl of the ink was deposited onto the CP electrode (5 × 5 mm

). For drying of ink droplets, the electrode was kept under an Ar atmosphere until the film was completely dry.
Electrochemical characterizations
All electrochemical characterizations were carried out at 25 °C unless otherwise noted, with temperature controlled by a thermostatic water bath. OERs were studied in a standard three-electrode cell connected to a CHI 660e workstation, using the prepared materials as the working electrode, a Pt mesh as the counter electrode and Hg/HgO (1.0 M KOH) or Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. The cell is made from PTFE to avoid potential iron contamination from glassware. All measured potentials were converted to values relative to a RHE according to the equation: potential =

Characterization of used samples
Characterizations of catalysts following OER catalysis were implemented according to the following protocols. For TEM, XPS, FT–IR and Raman measurements, catalyst-loaded electrodes were aged in solutions of 1.0 M NaOH (potential window 0–0.75 V versus Hg/HgO, 50 mV s
−1
) and 0.5 M NaBi (potential window 0.4–1.05 V versus Ag/AgCl, 50 mV s

), respectively, for 200 CV scans. Aged electrodes were rinsed with water and dried in ambient air before tests. For TEM measurements, sample dispersions were obtained by ultrasonic treatment of aged electrodes in EtOH. Sample dispersions were directly used by following standard TEM characterization procedures. To gather several centigrams (~40 mg) of Aza-CMP-Co powders after OER for XAFS measurements, post treatment based on photo-electrochemically-driven oxygen evolution was carried out using Ru(bpy)

is 1.27 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), which means that the excited photosensitizer can provide sufficient driven force to run the OER

. The reaction mechanism is shown thus:

$${\mathrm{S}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{8}^{2 - } + 2{\mathrm{P}}^ \ast \to 2{\mathrm{SO}}_4^{2 - } + 2{\mathrm{P}}^{+}$$

$$4{\mathrm{P}}^ + + {{{\mathrm{Cat}}}}. \Rightarrow {\mathrm{OER}}.$$

KIE experiments
Kinetic isotope effects were studied via electrochemical methods. LSV or CV was recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s
−1
and iR compensated (95%). For KIE calculation under alkaline conditions, experiments were carried out in NaOH aqueous solution (1.0 M) or NaOD D

O solution (1.0 M). For KIE calculation under near-neutral conditions, anhydrous sodium tetraborate in H

O solution ([Bi] = 0.1 M) and D

O solution ([Bi] = 0.1 M) were used for KIE measurements; pH of the borate buffer (H

O) was measured as 9.1 and pH of the borate buffer (D

pH-dependence characterizations
Both LSV and CV curves were recorded in NaOH solutions of varying concentration: 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 M. The pH values of NaOH solutions were obtained using a pH electrode pHydrunio that directly determines hydrogen ion activity and is suitable for highly concentrated alkaline solutions, unlike conventional pH glass electrodes. The measured pH values of NaOH solutions of 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 M were 12.49, 12.81, 13.11, 13.37 and 13.61, respectively. The pH values of NaBi buffered solutions for pH-dependence characterizations in near-neutral solutions were adjusted using H

BO

(0.5 M) and NaOH (0.5 M) solutions; pH values were obtained directly by a conventional pH meter. The reaction order based on OH

$${\mathrm{\rho}} _{[{\mathrm{OH}}^ - ]} = \left[ {\frac{{\partial {\mathrm{log}}j}}{{\partial ( - 14 + {\mathrm{pH}})}}} \right]_\eta = \left[ {\frac{{\partial {\mathrm{log}}j}}{{\partial {\mathrm{pH}}}}} \right]_\eta ,$$

where

Determination of reaction order for external anions (borate and phosphate)
The reaction order of additional anions (

):
$$\rho _{[{\mathrm{B}}]} = \left[ {\frac{{\partial \log j}}{{\partial \log \left[ {\mathrm{B}} \right]}}} \right]_\eta$$

Current density will be in a linear relationship with respect to the concentration of anions for APT-assisted catalytic water oxidation, as described in equation (

$$\left[ {\frac{{jA}}{{4F\Gamma }}} \right]_\eta = k^{{\mathrm{H}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}} + k^{\mathrm{B}}\left[ {\mathrm{B}} \right],$$

where

). The total concentration of buffer components was increased while pH was held constant in these experiments. The borate buffers at pH 7.7 and 11.0 and at different concentrations were prepared by dissolving boric acid in water, with pH adjusted by 10 M NaOH. Borate solutions at pH 13.3 and at different concentrations were prepared by dissolving sodium tetraborate in water, with pH adjusted by 10 M NaOH. Phosphate buffers at pH 12.6 and at different concentrations were prepared by dissolving tripotassium phosphate in water, with pH adjusted by 10 M KOH. Phosphate buffers at pH 7.0 and at different concentrations were prepared by dissolving monopotassium phosphate in water, with pH adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of tripotassium phosphate solution at the same Pi concentration.
Cation effects experiments
Both LSV and CV curves were recorded with iR compensation (95%) in sodium, potassium and lithium hydroxide solutions at a concentration of 1.0 M. The pH levels of 1.0 M NaOH, KOH and LiOH solutions were obtained using a pH electrode pHydrunio. The measured pH values of 1 M NaOH, KOH and LiOH solutions were 13.61, 13.63 and 13.34, respectively. For near-neutral conditions, LSV and CV curves were recorded with iR compensation (95%) in sodium, potassium and lithium borate buffers at a concentration of 0.5 M. The pH values of 0.5 M NaBi, KBi and LiBi solutions were 9.28, 9.43 and 9.10, respectively. All potentials were converted to the RHE scale when comparing current densities.
Computational details

and the LACVP** basis set

. Use of the B3LYP-D3 functional in this work was rationalized by comparison with several functionals, including pure functionals such as BLYP and PBE and hybrid functionals such as PBE-D3, PBE0-D3, M06, M06-L and BLYP-D3, in p

and redox potential calculations. To identify transition states for O-O bond formation, we searched the potential energy surface by scanning the terminal O-O bond distance. Single-point energy corrections were performed with the B3LYP-D3 functional using the LACV3P**++ basis set augmented with two
f

Based on gas-phase-optimized geometries, implicit solvation energies were estimated by single-point calculations using the Poisson–Boltzmann reactive field implemented in Jaguar (PBF) in water. The free energy of the standard hydrogen electrode of −4.44 eV was used, as recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.
