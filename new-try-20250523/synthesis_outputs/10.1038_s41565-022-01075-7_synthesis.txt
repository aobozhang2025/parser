synthesis of SACs from bulk metals, nitrogen gas (N 2 ) and graphite as precursors (c ). No synthetic chemicals or solvents (including water) are used in the preparation process and therefore no by-products or waste are generated. Because kinetic energy is the driving force of the reaction, the processing cost can be further reduced by directly using natural sources of kinetic energy, such as wind or hydro power. In some cases, mild thermal treatment can further enhance the ratio of single atoms (from 75% to 96% for the Fe–N–C system) and render the SACs more thermodynamically stable. Because one metal cluster equals tens of single atoms, these clusters are so scarce as to be very difficult to detect by morphological
