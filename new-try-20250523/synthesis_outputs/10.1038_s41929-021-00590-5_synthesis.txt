Supplementary | a,b, Gibbs free energies (ΔG) for elementary reactions in
transforming CO to CO on SDC /Ir (a) and SDC /Ir (b). Required energies for
2 6 6
forming different intermediates, *COOH and *CO + *O, were compared to determine the
minimum ΔG. Different *CO + *O structural configurations on both /Ir and /Ir were
6 6
considered.
We employed /Ir and /Ir to investigate different possible intermediates, *COOH and
6 6
*CO + *O, after CO adsorption. To compare the energy requirements between the possible

pathways with *COOH and *CO + *O intermediates, we firstly studied different adsorption sites
of the *CO dissociation reaction. The formed *O could bond to either a nearby Ir atom (green

lines) or a bridge site (red lines) between two Ir atoms. From the Gibbs free energy landscapes, we
found that the bridge site could contribute to a reaction pathway that required a lower energy
engagement. The *CO + *O intermediate at bridge site on /Ir has a larger ΔG for the

following hydrogenation reaction than the *COOH intermediate. Therefore, the reaction pathway
with *COOH is more favourable on /Ir surface. The ΔG of *COOH hydrogenation on

/Ir is comparable to that of CO dissociation reaction forming *CO + *O on bridge site,
6 2
making both pathways feasible. As *COOH hydrogenation involves a charge transfer process that
could be facilitated with applied potentials, we adopted the pathway forming *COOH in our
following calculations.

Supplementary | The change in adsorption energy for *CO, *COH, and *HCO on SDC
/Ir as a function of the electric field strength.

The change in adsorption energy for intermediate species on SDC /Ir in electric fields was

calculated to evaluate the effect of electric field strength at the surface. We took typical adsorbed
species, *CO, *COH, and *HCO on SDC /Ir , for example. The electric field induced changes

for *CO, *COH, and *HCO on SDC /Ir are less than 0.025 eV within the typical magnitude

of the electric field in the electrochemical double layer. The change in adsorption energy induced
by the electric field is much smaller than typical error estimates associated with DFT/GGA
computations, and they are not likely to change the trend studies here. Therefore, these effects are
neglected in this study.

Supplementary | Turnover frequency of /Ir for CO production and /Ir for
1 11
CH formation at bias potentials of -0.5 and -1 eV.

Applied external potential facilitates CO hydrogenation reactions in both CO and CH formation
2 4
pathways. The /Ir becomes 1.9 times more active under -1 V bias potential for CO

production than under -0.5 V. Its correlation between TOF and bias potential is close to other
reported electrochemical catalysts for CO reduction into CO11-13. CO hydrogenation into CH is
2 2 4
more active on /Ir due to its lower reaction and activation barriers than CO formation. The

same trend was observed on /Ir that a higher bias potential would promote the reaction

kinetic with an increased TOF value. The TOFs of /Ir for CH formation are lower than
11 4
those of /Ir for CO formation, which is in agreement with the higher reaction and activation

barriers of CO to CH on /Ir .

According to the XRD results in , air-calcined SDC/Ir catalyst indeed form the fluorite
structure with no impurities, indicating the successful incorporation of Ir into the SDC lattice. After
the reduction in H , the diffraction peaks of SDCIr-Ir and SDCIr-O shift towards lower angles in

comparison with those of SDCIr and SDCIr_SG, indicating the increase of the lattice parameters.
The diameter of Ir cation is smaller than those of Ce and Sm, so extracting Ir from the SDC lattice
host would cause the increase of the lattice parameters.
PBM powder has been prepared in this study to serve as the components of the cathode in the
electrolyzers, as PBM has been proved as a good electrocatalyst for CO electrolysis in a solid

oxide electrolyzer14,15.

Supplementary | H -TPR profiles for SDC, impregnated SDC/Ir, SDCIr_SG, and

SDCIr catalysts.
The low-temperature peaks of SDCIr-Ir and SDCIr-O can be assigned to valence change of Ir from
4+ to 3+, while the peaks at around 300 °C are relative to the exsolution of Ir. The reduction peak
of impregnated SDC/Ir appears at around 200 °C, which is associated with IrO reduction. The

reduction process of impregnated SDC/Ir occurs in a lower temperature range compared with
SDC/Ir and SDCIr_SG, indicating that IrO reduction requires much lower energy than Ir

exsolution process.

thickness of around 0.67 mm. The BZCYYb is about 20 μm thick, and the PBM-BZY/X cathode
is a litter bit thicker than its electrolyte, reaching about 31~34 μm. The latter one is supported by
a ~185 μm-thick BZC YYb electrolyte. The thickness of two porous electrodes is about 20 μm.

Supplementary Note 1
The hybridization between the oxygen 2p orbitals and the metal d orbitals is exemplified in a
molecular orbital diagram in Supplementary 
results in a decrease in the energy of antibonding states and a positive shift of the electrode
potential. Thus, the difficulty in the redox transition is increased.
The influence of added Ir on the bonding-antibonding interactions between Ce and O can be
revealed from the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) (Supplementary .
The positive and negative values of −pCOHP represent bonding and antibonding states,
respectively. With the introduction of Ir into the system, the antibonding states of Ce and O shift
downward relative to the Fermi level due to additional d electrons, as labelled by the green line.
