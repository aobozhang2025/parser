synthesis of M 1/MoS 2 SASCs. Different molecular precursors including metal salts (M2+), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and thioacetamide were introduced in this one -pot synthesis. The thioacetamide precursor used here plays a remarkable role, namely “killing two birds with one stone”. Firstly, the decomposition o f thioacetamide during hydrothermal reaction not only provides S sources for the formation of 2H -phase MoS 2 host but also creates the desired acidic environment (Equation 1 -4) to facilitate the synthesis of atomically dispersed single atoms embedded into the carrier lattice by suppressing the formation of metallic nanoparticle. Such a process can be described b y the chemical equations 1-4 bellow . The key innovation in creating operando acidic conditions enables us to incorporate a high density of substitutional magnetic single -atom doping beyond the regime that has not been accessed by other hydrothermal synthes is methods. A high density of magnetic dopant favours the long -range magnetic coupling, crucial for realizing the ferromagnetic ordering observed in Ni 1/MoS 2.
