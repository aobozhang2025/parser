Experimental section
Chemicals: All chemicals are analytical reagents without any further purification, including ammonium
molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH ) Mo O ·4H O), thioacetamide (CH CSNH ), manganous (II) acetate

acetate tetrahydrate (Co(CH COO) ·4H O), nickel (II) acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH COO) ·4H O) and

potassium hydroxide (KOH).
Characterization: The catalysts were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima Ⅳ, X-ray
diffractometer with Cu K ), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30, operating at
α
300 kV) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) equipment, inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectroscopy (ICP-MS, Optima 5300DV), Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM HR Evolution Raman
microscope, laser excitation at 532 nm) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with
EDS mapping being carried out at 80 kV using a JEOL ARM200F equipped with ASCOR aberration
corrector (cold field emission gun, Gatan Quantum ER spectrometer and Oxford X-max 100TLE SDD
EDS). The STEM image simulation was done using the multislice algorithm.
The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) including X-ray absorption near-edge structure
(XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra measurements of metal (Mn,
Fe, Co, Ni) K-edge were carried out at the XAFCA beamline of the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source
(SSLS)1. A Si double-crystal monochromator was applied to monochromatize the X-ray beam.
Metal (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) foils were used for the energy calibration, and all samples were measured under
transmission mode at room temperature. The EXAFS oscillations χ(k) were extracted and analyzed
using the Demeter software package. XANES simulations, based on the DFT optimized structures, are
performed using the finite difference method as implemented within the FDMNES package. The cluster
diameter for all the simulations is 8 Å. Due to the finite mean-free path of the photoelectron and to the
core-hole lifetime, broadening contributions were accounted for using an arctangent convolution.
The S K-edge absorption was obtained by recording fluorescence yield and selected by silicon draft
detector (FAST SDD@ Ultra High Performance Silicon Drift Detector, Ametek), using in an ionization
6 / 65
chamber at tender x-ray beamline BL16A1 at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center
(NSRRC), which is equipped with double crystal (Si ) monochromater (DCM).
DFT calculations
To obtain the energy profile for the whole catalytic process, the Gibbs energy was calculated for
each catalytic step by formula:
∆G= ∆E+∆ZPE−T∆S𝑣
Where ΔE is the DFT calculated energy difference between isolated reactants, catalyst and the final
products, ΔZPE means the zero-point energy correction contributed by the quantum vibration, and ΔS
is the vibrational contribution to the entropy at finite temperature.
For entropy ΔS, the expression was written as:
𝛽ℎ𝑐𝜈̃
∆S𝑣 = R[ −ln(1−𝑒−𝛽ℎ𝑐𝜈̃]]
𝑒𝛽ℎ𝑐𝜈̃ −1

where R is the ideal gas constant, R=8.314 J/(mol*K), β = , c is the speed of light, ℎ is the Planck
𝑘𝑇
constant, 𝜈̃ is the vibration frequencies calculated by DFT.
For the OER reaction, the reaction steps are written in the following ways2.
𝐻 𝑂 + ∗ → ∗𝑂𝐻 + (𝐻++𝑒−)

∗𝑂𝐻 → ∗𝑂 + (𝐻++𝑒−)
∗𝑂 + 𝐻 𝑂 → ∗𝑂𝑂𝐻 + (𝐻++𝑒−)

∗𝑂𝑂𝐻 → ∗ + 𝑂 + (𝐻++𝑒−)

where * refers to the active site in the surface of Ni /MoS .

synthesis of M /MoS SASCs.
1 2
Different molecular precursors including metal salts (M2+), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and
thioacetamide were introduced in this one-pot synthesis. The thioacetamide precursor used here plays a
remarkable role, namely “killing two birds with one stone”. Firstly, the decomposition of thioacetamide
during hydrothermal reaction not only provides S sources for the formation of 2H-phase MoS host but

also creates the desired acidic environment (Equation 1-4) to facilitate the synthesis of atomically
dispersed single atoms embedded into the carrier lattice by suppressing the formation of metallic
nanoparticle. Such a process can be described by the chemical equations 1-4 bellow. The key innovation
in creating operando acidic conditions enables us to incorporate a high density of substitutional magnetic
single-atom doping beyond the regime that has not been accessed by other hydrothermal synthesis
methods. A high density of magnetic dopant favours the long-range magnetic coupling, crucial for
realizing the ferromagnetic ordering observed in Ni /MoS .

The red shift of E and A modes in Raman spectra of M /MoS (M = Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) compared
2g 1g 1 2
to these modes of pure MoS suggests the successful incorporation of dopant atoms into the MoS lattice,
2 2
similar to other reported single-metal-atom doped MoS 9,10. This red shift of E and A modes is
2 2g 1g
attributed to the lattice distortion and charge doping effect after the substitutional metal dopant
introduced to the MoS lattice, consistent with MoS doped by other metal atoms with different level of
2 2
strain and charge doping10. The red shift of E mode indicates the increased number of strained MoS
2g 2
sites due to the presence of single metal atom dopant11. The red shift of A mode indicates the increased
1g
electron density of MoS after the substitutional replacement of Mo sites by single metal atoms12. These

changes induce the spin polarization of Mo and S atoms near Ni atoms, leading to the formation of
ferromagnetism at room temperature and , and resulting in the enhanced OER activity
under external magnetic field.

coordination and tetra-coordination is calculated to be 2.285Å and 2.217Å, respectively. The magnetic
properties observed for Ni /MoS sample also suggest a partial tetra-coordination configuration for

Our analysis showed that the oscillation patterns of the K-edge XANES for substitutional single metal
atoms (M), including Mn, Fe, or Co, were almost identical to those of Mo for the corresponding
M /MoS SASCs. Notably, the Ni K-edge XANES of the Ni /MoS sample exhibited an additional
1 2 1 2
feature approximately 10 eV above the absorption threshold E , as compared to its Mo counterpart,

while the remaining feature peaks correlated closely (Supplementary . This finding suggests that
although Ni is doped into the MoS crystal, it does not replace Mo exactly at the center of the trigonal

prism of S atoms, unlike Mn, Fe, and Co. In combination with our previous XANES calculations, we
can conclude that the substitutional Ni dopants in place of Mo in MoS are positioned closer to the four

19 / 65
S atoms forming one face of the S6 trigonal prism, ultimately resulting in a geometric configuration akin
to the NiS square planar or, more specifically, the NiS triangular pyramid. This result is in good

agreement with the simulation of M K-edge XANES and fitting FT-EXAFS spectra (Extended Data , Supplementary .

In the M K-edge FT-EXAFS spectra of all the M /MoS (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) SASCs, a single prominent
1 2
peak corresponding to the M-S bond can be clearly observed (Supplementary . The Ni-S bond
is found to be shorter (by approximately 0.02 Å) than the M-S bond observed for other substitutional
single metal dopants (M = Mn, Fe, Co), which is consistent with the results of the EXAFS fitting analysis

1 2
spectra are plotted as a function of ΔE (denote the energy difference between the photon energy E and

There are two peaks located at about 0 and 17 eV for all XANES spectra, while there is one more
additional peak located at around 6 eV only in XANES of Ni /MoS , indicating the local structure of Ni
1 2
in Ni /MoS is different from those of other M /MoS (M=Mn, Fe, Co) samples. It is also worth
1 2 1 2
mentioning that the EXAFS fitting results reveal that the bond length for Ni−S (2.27 Å) is shorter than
those of M−S (Mn−S: 2.30 Å, Fe−S: 2.29Å, Co−S: 2.29Å), and coordinate number for Ni−S (4.3) is
much smaller than those of M−S (Mn−S: 6.0, Fe−S: 6.1, Co−S: 5.9). All these observations support that
Ni atom bonds with four S atoms to form Ni-S non-centrosymmetric octahedral configuration, as

evidenced in Supplementary 
position but they adopt a trigonometry configuration of the M-S structure. In addition, the simulated

XANES spectra with simulated factors () are in well accordance with the
experimental data, which further prove the validity of proposed models of M /MoS (M = Mn, Fe, Co
1 2
and Ni).

Supplementary | The energy profile as a function of the diagonal displacement of transition
M atom (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni).
The total energies of M /MoS (M = Mn, Fe and Co) increase with the increasing displacement along
1 2
the diagonal direction, suggesting that the Mn, Fe and Co atoms energetically prefer to coordinate with
six S atoms. In contrast, the energy of Ni /MoS exhibits a maximum value around the Ni displacement
1 2
of 0.28 Å and then decreases, which reveals that the partial tetra-coordinated Ni /MoS is a metas 2
state, consistent with experimental observation.

Due to the D symmetry of six coordinated Ni /MoS , the d orbital of Ni atoms is split into A(dz2),
3h 1 2
E (dxy,dx2-y2), E (dxz,dyz) states, where the electrons are mainly located at the spin-up states of E and
1 2 1
E states, resulting in the robust magnetism. However, the symmetry of four coordinated Ni /MoS
2 1 2
reduces to C due to the Jahn-Teller distortion, and the d states will be divided into five states (dxz, dyz,

dxy, dx2-y2 and dz2) without spin splitting, leading to non-magnetism13. The symmetry of partial four
coordinated Ni /MoS in our experimental data lies in between the four and six coordinated Ni /MoS ,
1 2 1 2
and thus the magnetism of partial four coordinated Ni /MoS is stronger than four coordinated Ni /MoS
1 2 1 2
and weaker than six coordinated Ni /MoS .

The metallic character and non-integer magnetic moments suggest that the Stoner itinerant model should
be used to understand the ferromagnetism of Ni doped MoS , rather than the localized Heisenberg model.

According to Stoner theory18,19, the ferromagnetic order will be adopted if the criterion (I×D(E )> 1)
𝐹
is satisfied. I is Stoner parameter, and D(E ) is the density of states at Fermi level (E ). I can be
𝐹 F
obtained by relationship 〈𝜖 〉= I×M 20, where 〈𝜖 〉 refers to average exchange splitting energy
𝑘 𝑎𝑣𝑔 𝑘
between bands of spin up and spin down around Fermi level (E ), and M refers to average magnetic
F 𝑎𝑣𝑔
moment of Ni atoms. We evaluate 〈𝜖 〉= 0.218 eV , and M = 0.156 𝜇 for each Ni atom, then
𝑘 𝑎𝑣𝑔 𝐵
obtain I = 1.397 eV/𝜇 . Supplementary shows that the D(E )= 2.208 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠/(eV×Ni×

spin). Therefore, I×D(E )= 3.086> 1. Stoner’s criterion is satisfied, indicating that Ni doped MoS

can be classified as a Stoner-type itinerant ferromagnetic material.

The electronic states near fermi e”ergy’contributed by Ni atoms of Ni /MoS still exhibit the metallic
1 2
feature when the content of Ni dopant decreases, which suggests that the Stoner criterion can be also
applied to the Ni /MoS materials with different ratios of Ni:Mo. The calculated Stoner parameter I

presents a slight increase with increasing Ni contents shown in Supplementary 
1 2
of Ni /MoS changes from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism when the ratio of Ni:Mo is 1:19. Based

The higher degree of overlapping in PDOS at certain energy window between Ni and S atoms indicates

the stronger bonding interaction between Ni and S compared to the Ni and S , resulting in more electron
2 1
transfer between Ni and S atoms. To receive the transferred electrons with the specific spin component,

the spin direction of the electrons occupying at px/py orbitals of S atoms will align to the antiparallel
direction. As a result, the S atoms are magnetized. The more electrons transfer to S atoms, the smaller
net magnetic moments over S atoms, which is consistent with the calculated results shown in

Ni atoms possess a lower localized potential than that of Mo atoms, which indicates a stornger electron

The energy barriers of *O to *OOH over S site are determined to be 1.535 eV and 1.624 eV for the

XANES spectra. b, The corresponding first derivative curves.
There is a slight white line intensity increase for S K-edge under magnetic field (112 mT). The rising
edge of S K-edge under magnetic field (112 mT) also shows a blue shift comparing to that under zero
field. The above result is further revealed by the corresponding first derivative curves. Such an
observation indicates that S site possesses more empty states under magnetic field, thus facilitating more
electron transfer/accumulation on S atom during OER when external magnetic field is applied. As well
known, two H Omolecules lose four electrons in order to form one O molecule. Electrons transfer
2 2
process occurs between the catalytic site and related O species during OER. Therefore, the catalytic S
site acquires electrons from the related O species during reaction over Ni /MoS material, leading to
1 2
more electrons accumulated on S site. Therefore, S K-edge XAS spectra exhibit a gradual negative shift
with increasing applied potential during OER , which again reflects the dopant effect from
single Ni site.

using a series of techniques including XPS, Raman, TEM, XRD and ICP analysis. Specifically, TEM
measurement reveals the same lattice structure of 2H MoS without the formation of new phase of

material or any particle after reactions. This is consistent with XRD measurement that only reveals the
diffraction peaks contributed by 2H MoS . In addition, ICP analysis of catalyst samples before and after

reactions also shows negligible variation, indicating a superior stability of Ni /MoS catalysts under
1 2
reaction conditions.

The Ir top site in IrO shows a 1.641 eV barrier of Cl- adsorption, much lower than that of 3.642 eV over

S atoms in Ni /MoS , which indicates that the chemical adsorption of Cl- over IrO is more likely than
1 1 2 2
that of Ni /MoS . Therefore, Ni /MoS possesses an excellent tolerance to chloride ion using seawater

as electrolyte, thus exhibiting an excellent OER stability, much better than that of the commercial IrO .

𝛿 = 𝑘∙𝑍1.7∙𝜆4
