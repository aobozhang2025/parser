preparation of highly porous carbonaceous supercapacitors. In this work, we report a chemical-free and green O 2 •− generation strategy with a rechargeable porous carbonaceous material (denoted hereafter as carbonaceous geosupercapacitors (CGs)), directly through O 2 activation in water (a ). This CG material was directly prepared by simply pyrolysing cattle bones under O 2 -free conditions at high temperatures followed by acid etching. Arsenite (As(III)), a widespread toxic metalloid in waters and aquifers 21 , was chosen as a representative pollutant and additional pollutants, including dyes (rhodamine B dye (RB), methyl orange (MO), methylene blue (MB)), tetracycline (TC), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and Cr(VI), were used to verify the broad applicability of this technology. The reusability of developed CG for sustainable pollutant oxidation was further determined through electron recharging/refilling. The possibility of extending this O 2 •− producing system to obtain other potent ROS such as •OH radicals was also determined by a simple combination with iron oxides. A CG-embedded portable continuous-flow device was fabricated to demonstrate the potential value of this proposed system for water treatment. : Preparation and
