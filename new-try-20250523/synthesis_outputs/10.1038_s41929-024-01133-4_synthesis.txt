stable than subsurface defects and can be easily produced by experimental methods, as well8. To
take into account the onsite Coulomb interaction of Ti 3d states, the Hubbard U values of 2.58 and
3 eV were selected, namely DFT+U, according to previous reports on TiO 7,9,10. The projected

density of states (PDOS) of pristine TiO surface and defective TiO surface with one
2 2
bridging O vacancy using different U values reveal (Supplementary that the DFT (only
PBE functional) fails to capture the charge localization (excess electrons which occupy Ti (d)
orbitals when one O atom is removed). The U values of 2.58 and 3 eV show that the O vacancy
effect leads to a deep donor of Ti associated with the O vacancy, narrowing the band gap (with
respect to the defect state). The localized states are 0.65 and 0.8 eV below the conduction band
minimum (CBM) for U=2.58 and 3 eV, respectively, which is close to experimentally observed
states around 0.7 eV below the CBM11, narrowing significantly the band gap (experimental rutile
TiO band gap is 3 eV)12. The O vacancy defect shifts the Fermi level to the CBM which can

effectively facilitate charge transfer through CBM13. Moreover, creating another O vacancy (two
O vacancies in TiO ) further induce occupied-delocalized states near the CBM (Supplementary

, enhancing charge carriers hopping rate. The catalytic activity of nitrate reduction reaction
can be significantly enhanced on defective TiO due to higher conductivity, faster charge delivery,

caused by narrowing the band gap, which is in line with our experimental results.
