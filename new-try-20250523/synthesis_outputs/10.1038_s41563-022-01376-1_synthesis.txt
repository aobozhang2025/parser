Methods Synthesis of Pt, Pd–Pt and Pd nanoparticles All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Pt NPs were prepared by thermal decomposition of platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac) 2 , 99.98%) by colloidal synthesis using standard Schlenk techniques following a previously reported procedure 2 . First, 10 ml trioctylamine (95%), 0.66 ml 1-oleylamine (70%) and 2.5 ml oleic acid (90%) were added to 79 mg Pt(acac) 2 in a three-necked flask. The reaction content was degassed (<2 torr) for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 220 μl trioctylphosphine (97%) was added to the reaction mixture. The flask was further degassed at 120 °C for 30 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 350 °C at a rate of ~20 °C min −1 and kept at this temperature for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction content was split into two centrifuge tubes, and each was washed with a mixture of 10 ml isopropyl alcohol and 20 ml ethanol and recovered by centrifugation (8,586 g , 3 min). Finally, the NPs were suspended in hexanes. Pd NPs were synthesized using 77 mg Pd(acac) 2 , 4.5 ml of 1-octadecene (ODE), 5.5 ml tetradecene, 1.66 ml 1-oleylamine and 0.567 ml trioctylphosphine. The reaction content was degassed at 50 °C for 30 min, heated to 225 °C under nitrogen at a rate of ~20 °C min −1 and kept at this temperature for 30 min. For the Pd–Pt NP synthesis, 3.3 ml 1-oleylamine, 1.6 ml oleic acid and 40 ml 1-octadecene were added to 200.7 mg Pt(acac) 2 and 157 mg Pd(acac) 2 in a three-necked flask. The reaction content was degassed for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 550 μl trioctylphosphine was added to the reaction mixture. The flask was further degassed at 50 °C for 30 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 300 °C at a rate of ~20 °C min −1 and kept at this temperature for 15 min. The NPs were washed following the procedure described above. Synthesis of Pt@POF The POF was prepared using standard air-free Schlenk techniques following a previously reported procedure 19 . First, 9.3 g melamine (99%, Acros Organics) and 15 g terephthalaldehyde (99%, Acros Organics) were added to 495 ml dimethylsulfoxide (99.9%, Fisher) in a three-necked flask. The content was degassed at room temperature for 15 min, and then flushed with nitrogen, heated to 180 °C at a rate of ~20 °C min −1 and kept at this temperature for 72 h. The solid product was washed with acetone three times and dried under vacuum (~150 torr) at 80 °C for 24 h to give a yield of 64%. Then, 8 mg Pt NPs in hexanes was added dropwise to 400 mg POF dispersed in 10 ml of a 1:9 mixture of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and hexanes under vigorous stirring. The mixture was stirred for 20 min to allow the NPs to adsorb onto the support. The observation of colourless supernatants indicated the complete adsorption of the NPs. The solvents were then removed by centrifugation (8,586 g , 3 min) and the powder was dried at 80 °C for 3 h. Organic ligands were removed by calcination in air at 300 °C for 20 min. The NPs were then encapsulated by growing an additional POF layer around the preformed Pt/POF material: 0.75 g Pt/POF was added to 1.18 g melamine and 1.87 g terephthalaldehyde dissolved in 61 ml dimethylsulfoxide. The mixture was heated to 180 °C as above, but for 24 h. The final material was washed three times with acetone as described above to obtain Pt@POF in a yield of 64%. Synthesis of Pt@Al 2 O 3 First, 18 g Al(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O (>98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100 ml ethanol. Next, 1.2 g Pt@POF was added to the solution. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min, then ethanol was slowly removed in a rotary evaporator at 60 °C (water bath temperature) at 900 mbar for 1 h and then at 150 mbar for 1 h. The material was then dried under vacuum (~150 torr) at 80 °C for 24 h. The final product was obtained by calcining the sample at 600 °C for 5 h at a ramp rate of 0.5 °C min −1 . This procedure resulted in purely mesoporous Al 2 O 3 . For the synthesis of a mix of micro- and mesoporous Al 2 O 3 , an ammonia solution in ethanol (24 ml ethanol mixed with 18 ml ammonia solution (2 M in ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich)) was added to the sample; ethanol was removed in the rotary evaporator, before removing the ammonia solution, again following the procedure described above. Synthesis of supported Pt and Pd–Pt The appropriate amount of Pt or Pd–Pt NPs was added to the alumina support dispersed in hexanes under vigorous stirring to achieve a nominal metal loading of 0.5 wt%. The mixtures were stirred for 20 min to allow the NPs to adsorb onto the support, and the catalysts were recovered by centrifugation (8,586 g , 3 min). The observation of colourless supernatants indicated the complete adsorption of the NPs for each solution. The powders were then dried at 80 °C for 3 h and sieved below a grain size of 180 µm. Organic ligands were removed by fast calcination of the catalysts at 700 °C for 30 s ( ). Catalyst characterization Bright-field TEM was performed on a FEI Tecnai microscope operating at 200 kV. HAADF-STEM images were acquired using a FEI/Thermo Fisher TitanX device operating at 300 kV at the National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) facility of the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. To prepare powder samples for imaging, catalyst powder was shaken with lacey C/Cu grids. STEM tomography was performed at 300 kV using a FEI/Thermo Fisher TitanX device at NCEM with a 7 mrad convergence semi-angle and a beam current of ~3 pA. Images were acquired at tilt angles from −70° to +68° in steps of 2°. The tilt angle series was aligned using tomviz 1.9.0 ( www.tomviz.org ). The reconstruction was accomplished using the SART algorithm implemented in the Astra toolbox (version 1.9.0dev11) with 350 iterations. Visualization of the tomogram was accomplished using tomviz 1.9.0. STEM-EEL spectral data were collected at the Molecular Foundry on a TEAM I instrument, which is a double-corrected transmission electron microscope on the Thermo Fisher Titan platform with a Gatan Continuum GIF. Electron energy loss (EEL) spectra were recorded on a post-GIF K3 detector in electron counting mode with a dispersion of 0.18 eV per pixel. Sample thickness maps were acquired with 300 keV electrons with a 17.1 mrad convergence semi-angle and a 65 mrad collection semi-angle. Spectrum images were acquired using an 80 pA probe current, a 50 ms dwell time and 2 nm pixels with 16 × 16 sub-scanning of each STEM pixel. Sample thickness was estimated from the low-loss portion of the EEL spectrum image using the log-ratio method 32 . N 2 physisorption experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics 3Flex instrument. Powders were degassed under vacuum at 90 °C for 1 h and then at 300 °C for 5 h prior to N 2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. The micropore volume was calculated using non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) Advanced pore size distribution (PSD) using the slit geometry and carbon model. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a TA Instruments TGA-500 device. Pt NPs in hexanes were heated at a ramp rate of 10 °C min −1 under a flow of air of 45 ml min −1 . Powder catalysts were pretreated at 300 °C in air and then heated to 800 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min −1 . XPS measurements were carried out in a PHI VersaProbe I and III scanning XPS microprobe equipped with a hemispherical electron analyser with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1,486.6 eV) and an argon ion sputter gun. All samples were deposited on conductive carbon tabs on an aluminium holder, outgassed at 10 −4 mbar, and then transferred to the ion-pumped analysis chamber. The pressure was kept below ~5 × 10 −7 Pa during data acquisition. The incident X-ray spot size was 100 µm, and an excitation of 100 W at 20 kV was used for the radiation source. The binding energies were referenced to the C 1 s peak (284.8 eV) to account for charging effects. Given the Al Kα radiation energy (1,486.6 eV) of the XPS source and a Pt 4 d binding energy of 315 eV, Pt 4 d photoelectrons were emitted with a kinetic energy of 1,171.6 eV. This corresponds to an escape depth of ~1–2 nm ( ). XRF fluorescence measurements were collected on a XEPOS X-ray spectrometer. The spectrometer was equipped with a solid-state detector and samples were analysed at four different energies. PXRD samples were ground to fine powders, placed on amorphous silicon wafers and pressed down into the holders with a thin film of silicon grease. The samples were then placed on a Miniflex 600 diffractometer with Bragg–Brentano geometry equipped with a one-dimensional solid-state detector. Samples were scanned for 1.5 h to achieve the desired signal-to-noise ratio. All NMR data were collected with a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer (14.1 T field, 156.25 MHz for 27 Al) using a Varian ‘T3’ probe with a 3.2 mm zirconia rotor spinning at 20 kHz. The background signal from the rotor was negligible. Spectra are referenced to 0.1 M aqueous Al(NO 3 ) 3 at 0 ppm. The radiofrequency power was ~100 kHz; single pulse acquisition was used with 0.2 μs pulses, corresponding to a radiofrequency tip angle of ~20° for solids with quadrupolar coupling. Relaxation delays of 1 s between pulses allowed averaging of typically 40,000 acquisitions, yielding very high signal-to-noise ratios. Data collected with delays of 10 and 60 s showed no or only minor increases in intensity. Differential relaxation among signals for different Al sites was generally negligible, except in several samples that seemed to contain large proportions of both the AlO 5 -rich amorphous phase and the AlO 5 -poor crystalline transition alumina, which relaxed slightly more slowly. The relative proportions of four-, five- and six-coordinated Al (AlO 4 , AlO 5 and AlO 6 ) were estimated by the fitting of ±1/2 to ±3/2 spinning sidebands, which are less affected by second-order quadrupolar broadening than central transition resonances. XAS spectra of the platinum catalysts were recorded at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) at wiggler beamline 9-3 using a liquid nitrogen-cooled Si double-crystal monochromator with harmonic rejection and focusing optics. The storage ring was operated at 3 GeV with a ring current of 494–500 mA in top-off mode. A beam cross-section of 1 mm × 4 mm was used. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and EXAFS spectra were recorded at the Pt L 3 -edge (11,564 eV) and Pd K-edge (24,350 eV) in fluorescence mode using a passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) diode. The transmission spectra of Pt and Pd reference foils were collected simultaneously for internal energy calibration using nitrogen- or argon-filled ion chambers. Samples typically consisted of 60 mg catalyst pressed into a 7-mm-diameter pellet and mounted at 45° to the incident beam. The sample mass was specifically calculated to minimize self-absorption during the fluorescence measurement. Ex situ EXAFS spectra were acquired at room temperature. The XAS spectra were energy-calibrated, merged and normalized, and the resulting EXAFS spectra were extracted using the Athena interface of the Demeter software package 36 . EXAFS modelling was performed using the Artemis interface of the Demeter software 36 . S 0 2 was determined to be 0.79 ± 0.06 for the Pt L 3 -edge from fitting the Pt foil. Models were fitted in R space using k 1 , k 2 and k 3 weightings. For the Pt catalyst samples, the EXAFS spectra were modelled with an R range of 1.9–4.9 Å and a k range of 3.6–14.3 Å −1 . The Pt–Pt scattering path was simulated using FEFF in Artemis based on a Pt foil cif input file (ICSD code 243678). The EXAFS data from all catalysts were modelled simultaneously to minimize errors. The fitting was conducted using symmetric expansion parameter α . The average size of Pt from the fitted EXAFS data was calculated using the Pt–Pt coordination numbers from the first scattering path and fitting parameters determined in previously published work 22 . The XAS spectra of the Pd–Pt catalysts were collected during a separate beam time shift at 9-3. The EXAFS data of the Pd–Pt catalysts were modelled using S 0 2 values of 0.78 and 0.81 for the Pt L 3 -edge and Pd K-edge, respectively, with R ranges of 1.2–3.0 Å (Pd) and 1.7–3.2 Å (Pt), and k ranges of 2.7–12.5 Å −1 (Pd) and 3.1–12.0 Å −1 (Pt). The Pd–O, Pd–Pd, Pd–Pt, Pt–Pd and Pt–Pt scattering paths were simulated using FEFF in Artemis based on the following cif input files: Pt foil (ICSD code 243678), Pd foil (ICSD code 77885) and PdO (ICSD code 24692). Pd–Pt alloys were prepared by substituting Pt for Pd in the bulk Pd structure for Pd–Pt coordination, and Pd for Pt in the bulk Pt structure for Pt–Pd coordination. For each catalyst, the EXAFS data from the two edges were modelled simultaneously to minimize errors. DRIFTS measurements were performed using a Thermo Fisher Nicolet iS50 FT infrared spectrometer with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector. Powder samples were loaded into a Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFTS reaction cell. Measurements were carried out at room temperature, and 64 spectra were averaged for each spectrum to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Before the measurements, catalysts were pretreated for 30 min under O 2 (20 vol.%)/He at 300 °C (ramp rate of 10 °C min −1 ), for 10 min under He and for 30min under H 2 (5 vol.%)/He.
