Catalyst synthesis
Heterogeneous catalysis
Abstract
Selective conversion of syngas to value-added higher alcohols (containing two or more carbon atoms), particularly to a specific alcohol, is of great interest but remains challenging. Here we show that atomically intimate assembly of FeO
x
-Rh-ZrO

dual interfaces by selectively architecting highly dispersed FeO
x
on ultrafine raft-like Rh clusters supported on tetragonal zirconia enables highly efficient tandem conversion of syngas to ethanol. The ethanol selectivity in oxygenates reached ~90% at CO conversion up to 51%, along with a markedly high space-time yield of ethanol of 668.2 mg g
cat
−1
h
−1
. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that Rh-ZrO

interface promotes dissociative CO activation into CH
x
through a formate pathway, while the adjacent Rh-FeO
x
interface accelerates subsequent C–C coupling via nondissociative CO insertion. Consequently, these dual interfaces in atomic-scale proximity with complementary functionalities synergistically boost the exclusive formation of ethanol with exceptional productivity in a tandem manner.

, verifying the higher intrinsic activity. Impressively, the methanol selectivity of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

was only 7.8% in oxygenates (Supplementary

Notably, physical mixing Rh/ZrO

(denoted as Rh/ZrO

) or depositing FeO

interfaces did not appreciably promote the performance either (Supplementary Figs.

and

). Therefore, the assembly of dual interfaces with complementary functionalities in atomic-scale intimacy is of essential importance for dual-interface synergies.
We further varied the reaction pressure from 1 MPa to 4 MPa and the H

/CO ratio from 1 to 3 for the optimized 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

catalyst. We found that the EtOH selectivity had very trivial changes (Supplementary

, the EtOH selectivity surprisingly maintained above 88% in oxygenates even at a CO conversion of 50.9%

and Supplementary 
). Remarkably, under mild reaction conditions (Supplementary Tables

). More importantly, 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

also exhibited excellent stability for at least 200 h without any Rh aggregation (Supplementary 
) or visible decline in either activity or selectivity 
), demonstrating its great potential for practical applications.

. The much stronger intensities of geminal dicarbonyl CO peaks suggest the high dispersion of Rh species, consistent with the STEM observations (Supplementary

To determine the structure of Rh-FeO

The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra showed that compared with that of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

). The new peak at 2.32 Å is attributed to Fe–Rh coordination according to wavelet-transform (WT) analysis (Supplementary 
and Supplementary 
). Meanwhile, the absence of Fe–Fe coordination peak (>2.5 Å) implies that the majority of Fe oxo were atomically dispersed under reaction conditions. At the Rh K-edge, 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

Spectroscopic insights into syngas conversion

Switching CO to H

, the CO peaks on Rh/SiO

decreased slowly. Neither methoxy (a key intermediate for methanol, CH

O*) nor methane was observed (Supplementary 
). For Rh/ZrO

, the CO peaks decreased rapidly in H

, while the peaks of HCOO*, CH

O* (2,925 cm
−1
) and gaseous CH

(3,015 cm
−1
) all slightly increased at the early stage and then decreased gradually with time ,d
). Clearly, CO hydrogenation is difficult at either Rh-SiO

interfaces or on Rh metal surfaces but readily occurs at Rh-ZrO

interfaces via the formate pathway (no reaction on bare
t
-ZrO

, seen in Supplementary 
), in line with the observed much higher catalytic activity of Rh/ZrO

than Rh/SiO

).
On 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

, switching CO to H

led to a much quicker decrease in HCOO* ,d
). Meanwhile, CH

O* decreased instantly without any accumulation at the early stage, in sharp contrast to that of Rh/ZrO

). Given the competition between HCOO* hydrogenation to CH

O* or to CH
x
* at Rh-ZrO

interface, such suppression of CH

O* formation implies a shift of reaction path to HCOO* → CH
x
*. Such a shift is likely attributed to an accelerated consumption of CH
x
* via C–C coupling with adsorbed CO* to form EtOH at the adjacent Rh-Fe

O

interfaces, and was further supported by a faster consumption of CO* on 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

than on Rh/ZrO

(Supplementary 
). In addition, after switching to H

, hydroxyl groups were recovered on both Rh/ZrO

and 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

,c

Theoretical insights

was adopted as a support to construct the dual-interface model

,

(Supplementary Figs.

and

), and enhanced charge transfers at the interface based on Bader charge analysis (Supplementary 
), which agrees excellently with the experimental results 
and Supplementary Figs.

,

and

). After testing a single Fe atom with various possible O, OH and CO ligands on the Rh

cluster under reaction conditions, we found that the isolated Fe

cluster, with the Fe atom coordinated to two Rh atoms and two tilted CO molecules (denoted as Fe

CO activation is commonly considered as the rate-determining step in this reaction on Rh catalysts

,

,

. On Rh, we found that hydrogen-assisted CO activation via the HCO* intermediate is more favourable than direct dissociation (Supplementary Figs.

and

and Supplementary Tables

and

), but still notably endothermic by 0.77 eV and with a high barrier of 1.80 eV 
). At Rh-FeO
x
interfaces, hydrogen-assisted CO activation is considerably facilitated, with a reduced reaction energy of 0.08 eV and a barrier of 1.52 eV 
, Supplementary Figs.

and

, and Supplementary 
), owing to the enhanced adsorption of HCO* and O* intermediates (Supplementary 
and Supplementary 
). On
t
-ZrO

, direct and hydrogen-assisted dissociation are both thermodynamically unfavourable (Supplementary 
). By contrast, we found that strongly adsorbed CO* (
E
CO
= −1.92 eV) can readily react with OH* to form COOH* and then transform to HCOO* with a moderate barrier of 1.19 eV 
). Next, HCOO* exothermically migrates to the Rh-ZrO

interface owing to the increased adsorption energy from −1.91 eV to −3.47 eV, in line with the DRIFTS observation of much stronger HCOO* intensities on Rh/ZrO

and 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

than on bare
t
-ZrO

). Next, HCOO* species dissociate sequentially to HCO* and then CH* at the Rh-ZrO

interface with a barrier of 1.33 eV at most 
, Supplementary Figs.

and

and Supplementary 
). Therefore, compared with Rh metal and Rh-FeO
x
interface, Rh-ZrO

interfaces are more active for converting of CO to CH
x
*, where the hydroxylated
t
-ZrO

support serves as a HCOO* reservoir to boost the reaction.
Regarding C–C coupling, CO* insertion into CH

* is found to be the most favourable path for Rh, Rh-FeO
x
and Rh-ZrO

interface (Supplementary Figs.

–

and Supplementary Tables

and

). Nonetheless, on Rh, CO* insertion into CH

* to form CH

CO*, a key intermediate for EtOH, is much less favourable than direct CH

* hydrogenation to methane 
, Supplementary Figs.

–

and Supplementary Tables

and

), which makes methane to be the preferential product over Rh metal surfaces as observed on Rh/SiO

(Supplementary 
). However, at Rh-FeO
x
interfaces, the adsorption of CH

CO* is much stronger than that of CH

CO* on Rh owing to the enhanced orbital hybridization and considerable charge transfer from Fe to CH

CO* 
and Supplementary 
). Consequently, CO insertion into CH

* to form CH

CO* becomes exothermic by −0.23 eV at Rh-FeO
x
interfaces, along with a much low barrier of 0.80 eV, which is energetically more favourable than the hydrogenation of CH

* (endothermic by 0.10 eV; 
, Supplementary Figs.

,

and

, and Supplementary Tables

and

). At Rh-ZrO

 interfaces, CO* insertion into CH

* to form CH

CO* is found to be less feasible 
, Supplementary Figs.

and

and Supplementary Tables

and

). In brief, among these three types of reaction sites, Rh-FeO
x
interfaces appear to be the most favourable sites for C–C coupling, which agree excellently with the observation of markedly higher EtOH selectivity of Rh/Fe

O

and
x
Fe-Rh/ZrO

as well as the suppression of CH

O* formation in the DRIFTS results (Figs.
2a
and
5d
).
To achieve high EtOH yields in syngas conversion, it is crucial to ensure the balance of the two key elementary reaction steps: CO activation to CH
x
* and subsequent C–C coupling via the insertion of CO* into CH
x
*, both with high efficiency. As demonstrated by our calculations, the dual-interface synergy enables a tandem reaction process, that is, the Rh-ZrO

interface can efficiently activate CO* to form CH
x
* via the formate path with the ZrO

support as a formate reservoir; then, the formed CH
x
* readily couples with another CO* molecule to form CH

CO* intermediates at the adjacent Rh-FeO
x
interfaces, thus synergistically boosting exclusive EtOH formation 
). Therein, the variation of the FeO
x
coverage (Supplementary 
) allows balancing the kinetics of these two key elementary reactions (Supplementary 
), thus achieving a remarkably high EtOH productivity.
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated that the precise decoration of atomically dispersed FeO
x
onto ultrafine Rh rafts in Rh/ZrO2 to assemble dual FeO
x
-Rh-ZrO

interfaces intimately enables efficient tandem conversion of syngas to EtOH by achieving an EtOH selectivity of ~90% in total oxygenates at an appreciable conversion of 51%, along with a remarkably high STY of 668.2 mg g
cat
−1
h
−1
. In situ spectroscopic characterization and DFT calculations reveal that Rh-ZrO

and Rh-FeO
x
interfaces play complementary roles in the reaction by facilitating CO activation and C–C coupling, respectively. The delicate assembly of these two interfaces in atomic-scale proximity finely tailors the balance of the kinetics of the two key elementary reactions, thus synergistically boosting the exclusive EtOH formation in a tandem manner. These findings point out a new way to rationally design highly active and selective metal catalysts for complex reactions by assembling dual/multiple metal–oxide interfaces with specific functions in atomic-scale proximity.

solution and 600 mg of ZrO

were co-added into 25 ml of deionized water and mixed under vigorous stirring at 80 °C for 0.5 h. Ammonia was added dropwise to adjust the pH value to 12. Then, 1 ml of 1 mol l

in Ar at 400 °C for 3 h and then reduced at the same temperature for another 1 h in 10% H

in Ar to obtain the Rh

Fe-Rh/ZrO

catalysts, the as-prepared Rh/ZrO

catalyst was first modified with EG to passivate the possible nucleation sites on the ZrO

surface. Typically, the Rh/ZrO

catalyst was dispersed into EG and stirred for 12 h at 30 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged and dried at 70 °C overnight to obtain the modified catalyst.

Morphology and composition
TEM and HR-TEM measurements were performed on a JEM-2100F instrument operated at 200 kV to characterize the morphology of these samples. Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM measurements were performed on an instrument at 200 kV (JEM-ARM200F, University of Science and Technology of China). Elemental mapping via EDS was performed on the same equipment. The Rh and Fe contents of the various catalysts were analysed via ICP-AES (PerkinElmer Optima 7300 DV). Powder XRD measurements were carried out on a Philips X’Pert Pro Super diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 50 mA. The patterns were measured in the 2
θ
range from 20° to 80°. EPR spectroscopy was performed on a JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer operated at an X-band frequency of 9.1 GHz, a microwave power of 1 mW and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA550 instrument (TA Instruments) equipped with an evolved gas analysis furnace. After loading the sample into the furnace, the sample was heated to 500 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C min
−1
in 10% O

in N

(25 ml min
−1
). CO pulse chemisorption measurements were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. In brief, ~40 mg of the sample was loaded in a quartz U-tube and calcined in 10% O

in Ar followed by a reduction in 10% H

in Ar at 150 °C for 2 h. Next, the sample was cooled to room temperature, and CO pulses (10% CO in He) were introduced to the sample until saturation.
In situ XAS
In situ XAS measurements at the Fe K-edge (7,112 eV) and Rh K-edge (23,220 eV) were performed in fluorescence mode with a Si monochromator at the 1W1B beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) and in transmission mode with a Si monochromator at the BL14W1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) in China, respectively, considering the loadings of Fe and Rh. The storage ring of the BSRF worked at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA, and the storage ring of the SSRF worked at 3.5 GeV with a maximum current of 210 mA. A homemade reaction cell was used for the in situ experiments, which allows exposing the sample to different pretreatment gases or reaction gases, as well as sample heating to 500 °C. Typically, the as-prepared 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

sample was compressed into tablets and put into the reaction cell. After purging with He for 10 min at room temperature, the XAFS spectra were recorded and denoted as 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

-O. After that, the sample was reduced in 10% H

in He at 400 °C for 1 h and then cooled to 260 °C for 10 min. The XAFS spectrum was recorded and denoted as 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

-R. Finally, the same sample was exposed to syngas consisting of 24% CO and 72% H

balanced with He at 260 °C for another 1 h, and the XAFS spectra were sequentially recorded and denoted as 6Fe-Rh/ZrO

-S. The acquired XAS data were processed according to standard procedures using the ARTEMIS module implemented in the IFEFFIT software package. The EXAFS oscillation functions
χ
(
k
) were obtained by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption spectra and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step.
In situ XPS
In situ XPS measurements were conducted at the BL10B beamline Photoemission End-station at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in Hefei, China. In brief, the beamline is connected to a bending magnet and covers photon energies from 100 eV to 1,000 eV. The end-station consists of four chambers, that is, an analysis chamber, a preparation chamber, a quick sample load lock chamber and a high-pressure reactor. The analysis chamber, with a base pressure of <5 × 10
−10
torr, is connected to the beamline and equipped with a VG Scienta R3000 electron energy analyser and a twin anode X-ray source. After sample treatment, the reactor was pumped down to high vacuum (<10
−8
torr) for sample transfer. In the current work, the sample was first reduced with the flowing 10% H

in Ar at 400 °C for 1 h followed by treatment in syngas (24% CO, 72% H

, 4% Ar) (20 ml min
−1
) at 260 °C for another 1 h at the ambient pressure in the high-pressure reactor. Next, the sample was transferred to the analysis chamber for XPS measurements in the Fe 2
p
and Rh 3
d
region without exposing to air.
DRIFTS of CO chemisorption measurements
DRIFTS of CO chemisorption was performed on a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector and a low-temperature reaction cell (Praying Mantis Harrick). After loading a sample into the cell, it was reduced under 10% H

in Ar at 360 °C (the highest temperature that we can reach) for 2 h. After cooling the sample to room temperature in Ar, a background spectrum was collected. Subsequently, the sample was exposed to 10% CO in Ar (20 ml min
−1
) for approximately 30 min until saturation. Next, the sample was purged with Ar (20 ml min
−1
) for another 30 min to remove the gas-phase CO, after which the DRIFT spectrum was collected with 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm
−1
.
In situ DRIFTS of CO hydrogenation
In situ DRIFTS was performed on the same instrument described above. After loading a sample into the cell, it was reduced in 10% H

in Ar at 360 °C for 2 h. Then, the sample was cooled to 260 °C in Ar, and a background spectrum was collected. Next, the sample was exposed to 10% CO in Ar (20 ml min
−1
, 0.1 MPa) at the same temperature. After a 20 min reaction, the inlet was switched to Ar for another 20 min to remove the gaseous CO. Next, the inlet was subsequently switched to 10 H

in Ar (20 ml min
−1
). Moreover, DRIFTS spectra were recorded to monitor the changes in the intensities of different surface species during the entire process.
Catalyst evaluation
The conversion of syngas was carried out in a stainless-steel tubular fixed-bed reactor (Anhui CHEM Machinery Technology) equipped with a quartz lining with an inner diameter of 10 mm. In a typical reaction, 100 mg of Rh-based catalyst mixed with 1 g of quartz sand (30–60 mesh) was loaded into the reactor and reduced in 10% H

in N

(30 ml min
−1
) at 400 °C for 2 h. After reduction, the sample was cooled to 260 °C, and then, syngas (24% CO, 72% H

) with 4% Ar as an internal standard was introduced into the reactor and pressurized slowly to 2.5 MPa. The data were collected after at least 2 h on stream. Products were analysed by an online GC (Panna A91 PLUS). A capillary column (PLOT-Q) connected to a flame ionization detector (FID) was used to analyse CH

, C

–

paraffins and oxygenated products; a TDX-01 packed column connected with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to analyse CO, CO

, Ar and CH

. CH

was taken as a reference bridge between the FID and TCD.
CO conversion (X(CO)) was calculated on a carbon atom basis, that is,
$${\mathrm{X}}\left({\mathrm{{CO}}}\right)=\frac{{\mathrm{CO}}_{\mathrm{in}}\,-{\mathrm{CO}}_{\mathrm{out}}}{{\mathrm{CO}}_{\mathrm{in}}}\times 100 \%$$

where CO
in
and CO
out
in equation (

) represent the moles of CO at the inlet and outlet, respectively.
The CO

selectivity (S(CO

)) was calculated according to
$${\mathrm{S}}\left({{\rm{CO}}}_{2}\right)=\frac{{{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}}_{\mathrm{out}}}{{\mathrm{CO}}_{\mathrm{in}}-\,{\mathrm{CO}}_{\mathrm{out}}}\times 100 \%$$

where CO
2outt
in equation (

) represents moles of CO

at the outlet.
The selectivity
S
for each organic product
i
was determined on the basis of the number of C atoms by equation (

), where
n
i
in equation (

) represents the moles of product
i
at the outlet and
C
i
is the carbon number of product
i
. The carbon balance over the Rh-based catalysts was greater than 98%.
$${S}_{i}=\frac{{n}_{i}{C}_{i}}{\sum {n}_{i,\,j}{C}_{i,\,j}}\times 100 \%$$

The STY of EtOH was calculated according to
$${\mathrm{STY}}\left({\rm{EtOH}}\right)=\frac{{F}_{\mathrm{CO}}S\left({\mathrm{EtOH}}\right)}{2\times W}\times 46$$

where
F

denotes the weight of the catalyst.
Computational methods
All spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)

. Projector augmented wave

potentials and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional

were used. The kinetic energy cut-off was specified to be 400 eV. Electronic optimizations were converged to 10
−4
eV per atom, and the geometry optimizations were considered to be converged until the forces on each ion were less than 0.05 eV Å

surface according to the EPR and DRIFTS measurements (Supplementary Figs.

and

), where a
p
(4 × 3) supercell slab with a two-layer oxide thickness was used. The adsorbates and the topmost oxide are relaxed. The stepped Rh surface is modelled using a
p
(3 × 2) slab with five atomic layers, including 60 Rh atoms. During optimization, the adsorbates and the top three layers of Rh atoms are relaxed. The neighbouring slabs were separated by a 15 Å vacuum to avoid interactions between them. Monkhorst–Pack
k
-point meshes of 1 × 2 × 1 and 2 × 3 × 1 were used to sample the Brillouin zones of the
t
-ZrO

 and Rh supercell surface slab models, respectively.
The improved force reversal method

was used to identify the transition states (TS) via vibrational analysis until all the forces were less than 0.05 eV Å
