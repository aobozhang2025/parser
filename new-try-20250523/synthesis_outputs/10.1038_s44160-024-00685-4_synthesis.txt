Synthesis of isolated Ru–O3 sites on hexagonal close-packed intermetallic penta- Experimental Section Chemicals . All chemicals used in this study were obtained from commercial suppliers and were directly used without postprocessing. For synthesis, Pd(acac) 2 (99%), Pt(acac) 2 (97%), Ru(acac) 3 (97%), Ir 4(CO) 12 (98%), Mo(CO) 6 (98%) and OAm (>70%) were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich while NH 4Br (99.0%) was obtained from Aladdin. For necessary references, Pt/C catalys t (20 wt.% of 3 nm - Pt nanoparticles on graphitized carbon) and Pd/C catalyst (10 wt.% of Pd on activated carbon) were bought from Sigma -Aldrich while 20% Ir on Vulcan XC -72 catalyst (Ir/C), Ru/C catalyst (5 wt.%), RuO 2 (Ru content >75%) and commercial PtRu /C catalyst ( ＜3.5 nm -PtRu nanoparticles with a Pt content of 19.65 -20.05% and a Ru content of 9.95 -10.35%) were obtained from Premetek, Shanghai Yuanye Biological Co. Ltd., Johnson Matthey and Hesen, respectively. For electrochemical testing, KOH (95%) wer e acquired from Aladdin and Nafion D -521 dispersion (5 wt.%) was bought from Alfa Aesar. Isopropanol, ethanol and cyclohexane were all supplied by Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemicals Company. All solutions were freshly prepared with ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ*c m).
