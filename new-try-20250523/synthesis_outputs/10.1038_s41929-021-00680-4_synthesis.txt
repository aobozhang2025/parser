Catalyst preparation The initial experiments to investigate the role of atom-trapped Pt were performed with the commercial ceria (Solvay-Rhodia HS 5, also referred to as HSA ceria since it has a higher surface area than the ceria prepared by calcination of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 , which was used for the Pd–Pt catalysts). To prepare engineered CeO 2 , tetraamineplatinum nitrate solution was impregnated onto CeO 2 powder by conventional wet impregnation, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h. The powder was then calcined at 800 °C for 10 h in flowing air. The obtained materials were denoted as 1Pt@CeO 2 and 3Pt@CeO 2 , corresponding to the Pt loadings of 1 and 3 wt.%, respectively. The high temperature treatment causes a drop in BET surface area, from 135 m 2 g −1 for the as-received ceria to 60 m 2 g −1 for the pure ceria (PS ceria), 78 m 2 g −1 for 1Pt@CeO 2 and 100 m 2 g −1 for the 3Pt@CeO 2 sample. The Pt interacts strongly with the ceria surface, pinning defect sites and slowing the rate of ceria sintering 26 , 35 . The nucleation and growth of Pt on PS CeO 2 support (precalcined at 800 °C in air for 10 h) and the 1Pt@CeO 2 (subjected to a similar thermal treatment) helped identify the role of trapped Pt atoms during catalyst preparation. An appropriate amount of tetraamineplatinum nitrate (Pt(NH 3 ) 4 (NO 3 ) 2 ) was added to each support followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h and calcination at 500 °C for 4 h in air. The total Pt loading for each catalyst was 3 wt.% Pt and the samples were denoted as 3 wt.%Pt/PS ceria and 2Pt/1Pt@CeO 2 . For the methane oxidation study, we used ceria powder prepared in the laboratory via decomposition of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 , as described in our previous work 26 . This ceria powder has a BET surface area of 85 m 2 g −1 as prepared. To prepare the engineered catalyst support, we used 2 wt.% Pt via impregnation, drying in air, calcination at 500 °C following by ageing in air at 800 °C for 10 h. This catalyst support is denoted as 2Pt@CeO 2 . Palladium nitrate (1.09 wt.% Pd) was deposited on the 2Pt@CeO 2 by wet impregnation, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h and calcining at 500 °C for 4 h in air. The catalyst was denoted as 1Pd/2Pt@CeO 2 . To provide a comparison, we also prepared two reference samples of 1Pd/CeO 2 (1.09 wt.%Pd) and (1Pd + 2Pt)/CeO 2 containing the same loading of metal as the 1Pd/2Pt@CeO 2 . For the reference (1Pd + 2Pt)/CeO 2 catalyst (BET surface area 64 m 2 g −1 ), the palladium(II) nitrate solution was impregnated onto the CeO 2 first, then dried at 120 °C in air for 12 h. After calcination at 500 °C in air for 4 h, tetraamineplatinum nitrate (2 wt.% Pt) was impregnated onto the material progressively, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h in air and calcining at 500 °C for 4 h in air. The Pd/CeO 2 (1.09 wt.%Pd) sample was prepared by impregnating appropriate amount of palladium(II) nitrate solution onto the CeO 2 . Then, the sample was obtained after drying at 120 °C in air for 12 h and calcining at 500 °C in air for 4 h. The morphological properties of this set of catalysts are shown in Supplementary Table 1 .
