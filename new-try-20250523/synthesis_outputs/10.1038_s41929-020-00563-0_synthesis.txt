Next, the collected solid powder (core–shell–shell PdCl

Catalytic evaluation
The reaction was carried out in a 50 ml glass electrolytic cell with a magnetic stirrer. In a typical experiment, a DMF (40 ml) solution that contained nitrobenzene (0.005 mmol ml
–1
), styrene (0.005 mmol ml
–1
) and different catalysts (yolk–shell Pd

(12 mg) and hollow Pd

@Fe

(24 mg)) was loaded into the reactor. The reactor was sealed and linked with a conduit to combine with the water-splitting electrolytic cell. Then, the reactor was heated to 80 °C and stirring with a speed fixed at 450 r.p.m. to ensure the diffusion effect was eliminated. Mesitylene (1 mmol), used as the internal standard, was added at the beginning of the reaction with stirring at 80 °C in an oil bath. The product was identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TXQ Quantum XLS, column TG-WAXMS, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quantitatively analysed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-2010 Plus equipped with a flame ionization detector) and a 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm KB-WAX capillary column (Kromat Corporation) using mesitylene as an internal standard. The selectivity and yield were calculated using equations (

) and (

), respectively:
$$\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{Selectivity}}\,{(\%)} =\\ \frac{{{\mathrm{produced}}\,{\mathrm{1}} {\hbox{-}} {\mathrm{phenyl}} {\hbox{-}} 2 {\hbox{-}} ({\mathrm{phenylamino}}){\mathrm{ethanol}}\,({\mathrm{mmol}})}}{{{\mathrm{1}} {\hbox{-}} {\mathrm{phenyl}} {\hbox{-}} 2 {\hbox{-}} ({\mathrm{phenylamino}}){\mathrm{ethanol}}\,({\mathrm{mmol}})\,+ \,{\mathrm{aniline}}({\mathrm{mmol}}) \,+ \,{\mathrm{phenylethane}}\,({\mathrm{mmol}}) \,+ \,{\mathrm{styrene}}\,{\mathrm{oxide}}\,({\mathrm{mmol}})}}\\ \times 100\end{array}$$

$${\mathrm{Yield}}\,{\mathrm{{(\%)} }} = \frac{{{\mathrm{produced}}\,1 {\hbox{-}} {\mathrm{phenyl}} {\hbox{-}} 2 {\hbox{-}} ({\mathrm{phenylamino}}){\mathrm{ethanol}}\,{\mathrm{(mmol)}}}}{{{\mathrm{conversion}}\,{\mathrm{of}}\,{\mathrm{styrene}}\,{\mathrm{(mmol)}}}} \times 100$$

To generate the results of specific productivity shown in 
, for each cycle the system was reacted at 80 °C for 1 h. When the reaction time reached 1 h, 50 μl of the solution was extracted with a miniature syringe from the glass electrolytic cell and analysed by gas chromatography. Meanwhile, we reinjected the system quickly with new reactants (nitrobenzene (0.2 mmol) and styrene (0.2 mmol)) to let the system start the next cycle for another hour. A total of 13 cycles were conducted, and the yields of each cycle were recorded by gas chromatography. We could calculate the yields of each cycle test by the same method as above and the specific productivity was calculated using equation (

):
$$\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{Specific}}\,{\mathrm{productivity}}\left( {{\mathrm{mmol}} \, {\mathrm{ml}}^{ - {\mathrm{1}}} \, {\mathrm{h}}^{ - {\mathrm{1}}}} \right)\\ = \frac{{{\mathrm{produced}}\,{\mathrm{1}} {\hbox{-}} {\mathrm{phenyl}} {\hbox{-}} 2 {\hbox{-}} ({\mathrm{phenylamino}}){\mathrm{ethanol}}\,({\mathrm{mmol}})}}{{{\mathrm{volume}}\,{\mathrm{of}}\,{\mathrm{the}}\,{\mathrm{solvent}}\,({\mathrm{ml}})\ \times\ {\mathrm{reaction}}\,{\mathrm{time}} \ ({\mathrm{h}})}}\end{array}$$

Characterization
XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku Miniflex-600 operated at 40 kV voltage and 15 mA current using a Cu Kα radiation (
λ
= 0.15406 nm). The step size was 0.02° and the scanning speed was 8° min
−1
. TEM images were recorded on a Hitachi-7650 worked at 100 kV. The high-resolution TEM and HAADF-STEM images, and the corresponding electron energy-loss spectroscopy, were recorded on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin high-resolution transmission electron microscope worked at 200 kV and a JEOL JEM-ARM200F TEM/STEM with a spherical aberration corrector worked at 300 kV. Through-focal HAADF series were acquired at nanometre intervals, with the first image underfocused (beyond the beam exit surface) and the final image overfocused (before the beam entrance surface). The images were then manually aligned to remove the sample drift effects. Elemental analysis of Pd in the solid samples was detected by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (Optima 7300 DV). For the hard XAFS measurement and data analysis, XAFS spectra at the Pd and Fe K-edges were recorded at the XAS station (BL14W1) of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The Pd and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure data were recorded in the fluorescence mode. The storage ring worked at an energy of 3.5 GeV. The hard X-ray was monochromatized with Si double crystals. The acquired EXAFS data were extracted and processed according to standard procedures using the ATHENA module implemented in IFEFFIT software packages. The k

-weighted EXAFS spectra were obtained by subtracting the postedge background from the overall absorption and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step. Subsequently, k

-weighted
χ
(k) data in the k-space were Fourier transformed to real (
R
) space using a Hanning windows (
d
K
= 3.00–12.173 Å
−1
) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. To obtain the quantitative structural parameters around the central atoms, least-squares curve parameter fitting was performed using the ARTEMIS module of IFEFFIT software packages. The following EXAFS equation was used:
$$\chi \left( k \right) = \mathop {\sum}\limits_j {\frac{{N_jS_o^2F_j\left( k \right)}}{{kR_j^2}}} \exp \left( { - 2k^2\sigma _j^2} \right)\exp \left[ {\frac{{ - 2R_j}}{{\lambda \left( k \right)}}} \right]\sin [2kR_j + \phi _j\left( k \right)]$$
