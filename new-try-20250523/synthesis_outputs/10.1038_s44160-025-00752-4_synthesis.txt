preparation of RE-Cu catalysts with similar heterostructures and can enhance the CO 2RR performance. Among them, the as-synthesized Pr-Cu catalyst exhibited unique structural features that significantly affected the product selectivity of CO 2RR. Supplementary Note 3. A brief discussion about the key intermediates during CO 2RR. In general, the pathway leading to both ethylene and ethanol generation remains identical until the formation of the OCHCH 2 intermediate, which is possibly adsorbed in two manners: one is the O-terminal adsorption (*OCHCH 2) and the other is the C- terminal adsorption (*CH 2CHO)4-9. Taking insights into these adsorption Cu catalysts using different synthesis methods with during CO 2RR in 1 M KOH at 700 mA cm-2. Data are presented as mean ± s.d.
