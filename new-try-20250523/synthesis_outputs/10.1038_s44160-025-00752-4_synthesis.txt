As depicted in and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, the catalyst synthesis
methods employed in this study mainly consist of two branches, one is how to adjust
the precipitation of Cu and Pr species, while the other focuses on optimizing the
calcination process. When considering the effect of precipitation steps, we designed a
co-precipitation (Supplementary and a stepwise precipitation step and
Supplementary for comparison. It is evident that in a co-precipitation step
(Supplementary , the (NH ) CO precipitant demonstrates favorable
4 2 3
precipitation efficacy towards Pr3+ ions, but exhibits inadequate precipitation ability for
Cu2+ ions. Upon combination with CO 2-, the residual Cu2+ ions can precipitate as

unstable CuCO , which is usually further hydrolyzed in the presence of H O to form
3 2
Cu (OH) (CO ) . This results in a non-uniform distribution of Pr and Cu precipitation
x y 3 z
during a co-precipitation step. In contrast, in the stepwise precipitation step and
Supplementary , the separate addition of (NH ) CO and KOH allows in
4 2 3
combination of CO 2- with Pr3+ first to form stable Pr (CO ) precipitates, and then
3 2 3 3
KOH, as a secondary precipitant, effectively combined with Cu species to form
Cu(OH) (major) and Cu (OH) (CO ) (minor) precipitates. This approach not only
2 x y 3 z
facilitates controlled precipitation of Pr and Cu species in desired ratios, but also allows
manipulation of the stacking pattern of Pr and Cu precipitates by adjusting the addition
strategy of these two precipitants to induce the formation of a homogeneous Pr-Cu
structure.
Decarbonation and dehydration of the Pr-Cu precursor and dispersion of the Cu
species are achieved by calcination, which involve the application of a co-calcination
(Supplementary and a stepwise calcination step and Supplementary
. It is evident that in a co-calcination step (Supplementary , Pr and Cu
are mutually dispersed at an atomic level as Pr(III)-O-Cu(II), weakening the
coordination of Cu-Cu. Consequently, the insufficiently surrounded Pr(IV) hindered
the migration of O2- near the Cu atoms, thus reducing the ability to form oxygen
vacancies near the Pr(III)-O-Cu(II) sites. In contrast, the stepwise calcination method
exhibits unique effects on the dispersion of the Cu species and Supplementary
. In particular, the homogeneous Pr-Cu precursor obtained by co-precipitation
can form the Pr O -Cu-CS catalyst with Cu atoms dispersed atomically in the Pr O
6 11 6 11
lattice; the heterogeneous Pr-Cu precursor obtained by stepwise precipitation can
generate the Pr O -Cu-SS catalyst with abundant Pr-Cu heterointerfaces. It indicates
6 11
that the secondary calcination step further suppresses the formation of Pr-Cu composite
oxide (such as Pr CuO and PrCuO ), especially at the heterointerface. This enables the
2 4 2
preservation of Cu-Cu synergy and enhances the polarity near the heterointerface to
induce the formation of more O vacancy sites.
Similar structural evolutions were observed in other RE-Cu catalysts during the
same synthesis processes as Pr-Cu catalysts, wherein the precipitation and calcination
behaviors significantly influenced the CO RR performance. Different Ce-Cu and Nd-

Cu catalysts synthesized by the abovementioned methods were used as typical
examples to compare their structures and their corresponding CO RR performances. In

detail, the Ce-Cu catalysts synthesized by different methods exhibited nanostructures
as atomically dispersed Cu in CeO (CeO -Cu-CS, Supplementary ,

Supplementary , the CO RR performance test revealed that the CeO -Cu-SS
2 2
and Nd O -Cu-SS catalysts synthesized by the stepwise precipitation and stepwise
2 3
calcination method achieved the highest efficiency for multi-carbon products (60.6%
at 50.0%) compared to those synthesized by the other two methods. These results
demonstrated that the stepwise precipitation-stepwise calcination strategy is universal
for the preparation of RE-Cu catalysts with similar heterostructures and can enhance
the CO RR performance. Among them, the as-synthesized Pr-Cu catalyst exhibited

unique structural features that significantly affected the product selectivity of CO RR.

Supplementary Note 3. A brief discussion about the key intermediates during CO RR.

In general, the pathway leading to both ethylene and ethanol generation remains
identical until the formation of the OCHCH intermediate, which is possibly adsorbed

in two manners: one is the O-terminal adsorption (*OCHCH ) and the other is the C-

terminal adsorption (*CH CHO)4-9. Taking insights into these adsorption

configurations and corresponding reaction pathway (Supplementary , only the
*OCHCH structure can lead to a combined production of ethanol and ethylene via the

subsequent C=C double bond hydrogenation, while the reaction pathway involving the
*CH CHO structure cannot efficiently deliver the ethylene production which is not

consistent with the experimental results . Therefore, we focused on the O-
terminal adsorption configuration of *OCHCH for the relevant DFT calculations.

Typically, the production of C H OH and C H from CO follows the *OCHCH
2 5 2 4 2 2
intermediate, which undergoes symmetric hydrogenation to decompose directly into
*O and C H , and subsequent transformation from *O to *OH and OH-. In contrast, the
2 4
pathway for C H OH production from *OCHCH requires multiple selective
2 5 2
hydrogenation steps to produce the intermediates *OCHCH , *OCH CH ,
3 2 3
*HOCH CH and C H OH.

Using the pure Pr O surface as a reference, we investigated the state of surface

O by calculating the O formation energy, as shown in ,i. For pure Pr O ,
vac vac 6 11
the holes formed by the surface Pr atoms are not fully covered by O atoms, resulting in
the formation of intrinsic surface O sites. Therefore, the further generated O can
vac vac
be generally categorized into two kinds , including the O sites adjacent to
vac
the intrinsic O (O 1) and the O sites far from the intrinsic O (O 2), which
vac vac vac vac vac
exhibited O formation energies of -0.649 and -0.685 eV, respectively . The
vac
Pr O -O model exhibited an O formation energy of 0.321 eV, which is still low

enough for continued O formation under mild experimental conditions. After Cu was
vac
loaded onto this model, the ideal Pr

-Cu model showed an O

the surface O atoms. Nevertheless, this increment is still relatively modest compared to
energy barriers for chemical reactions at room temperature (0.75~1 eV), allowing for
further formation of surface O

-Cu and
Pr O -O -Cu with much higher O concentrations were 1.230 eV and 1.596 eV,
6 11 vac62 vac
respectively, which exceed those of the aforementioned models (>1 eV), suggesting
that a high concentration of O could be formed and is relatively stable during the
vac
CO

RR process.

Supplementary Note 5. A detailed discussion about the Bader charge and PDOS
analyses.
As shown in , the Cu atoms loaded on the surface of Pr O exhibited
6 11
different properties from those at the interface. The surface Cu atoms showed almost
no charge gain or loss (-0.017 and -0.036 e), approaching the property of metallic Cu,
whereas the interface Cu atoms underwent a greater charge depletion compared to those
on the surface. It suggests that the formation of Cu0/Cuδ+ structure is favored by the
bonding between interface Cu atoms and surface O atoms of the Pr O -O substrate,
6 11 vac
which is consistent with the experimental findings (Figs. 3, 4 and Supplementary . Within the Cu0/Cuδ+ structure, the properties of interface Cu differed significantly
from those of the surface Cu and changed with the O concentrations (0.178 e in
vac
Pr O -O -Cu and 0.138 e in Pr O -O -Cu). Therefore, it can be inferred that the
6 11 vac52 6 11 vac62
active region of the Pr

The projected density of state (PDOS) distributions for pure Cu, Pr O -O -Cu

atoms exhibited a broader d-orbital energy distribution (a more delocalized d-orbital
energy distribution) and possessed more states at the Fermi level. This observation
aligned with the morphology and structure of the Pr O -Cu-SS catalyst (stab)

which served as an important catalytic site.

O -Cu and Nd O -O -Cu models was carried out to investigate whether stable
vac41 2 3 vac32
interfacial Cu0/Cuδ+ structures could be formed when Cu was loaded onto these two
models. For the CeO system, the Bader charge of interfacial Cu in the CeO -O -Cu
2 2 vac41
model was 0.122 e, indicating the formation of interfacial Cu0/Cuδ+ structures. However,
the XPS analysis revealed that the surface O concentration of CeO -Cu was lower
vac 2
than that of Pr O -Cu (Supplementary and Supplementary .
6 11
Consequently, although loading Cu on CeO can form a considerable Cu0/Cuδ+ active

interface, the corresponding free energy curves indicated that the ethylene pathway was
not effectively suppressed, resulting in a limited selectivity for ethanol production.
Unlike CeO and Pr O , the O content in the perfect Nd O crystal is much lower
