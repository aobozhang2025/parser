pseudo-binary alloy structure. To obtain further structural information, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was subsequently performed. The Pt–Co–In/CeO

sample was reduced in situ by a flow of hydrogen at 550 °C for 0.5 h. The Pt L
III
-edge, Co K-edge and In K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) of the pretreated Pt–Co–In/CeO

were similar to those of the corresponding foils, indicating that these metals are reduced mostly to a zero-valent state (Supplementary 
). A small contribution of In

O

was observed in the In K-edge XANES (Supplementary 
) and extended XAFS (EXAFS) spectra (Supplementary 
; the Fourier transform of the EXAFS is shown in Supplementary 
). This suggests that the residual indium species, which did not participate in the alloy formation, is present as an oxide on CeO

. EXAFS curve-fitting (Supplementary 
and Supplementary

and is consistent with the result of the HAADF-STEM-EDX analysis. In–O scattering was also derived for In K-edge fitting, indicating the presence of In

as observed for the XANES. Thus, the XAFS analysis demonstrated the formation of (Pt

pseudo-binary alloy nanoparticles on CeO

and Pt–Co–In/CeO

showed similar Pt 4

emissions at 71.6 and 71.4 eV, respectively, which are assigned to metallic platinum (Supplementary

. The small negative shift indicates that platinum was slightly electron-enriched upon alloying with indium and cobalt. The indium 3

The Pt–Co–In/CeO

catalyst was then tested for the CO

In contrast, Pt–Co–In/CeO

retained a high C

H

conversion (
∼
50%) for 20 h. Predictably, catalysts containing a typical metal (indium or tin) exhibited a high C

H

selectivity (82–95%), attributed to the ensemble effect by alloying, where the highest selectivity was obtained with Pt–Co–In (95%). Platinum and Pt–Co showed very low C

H

selectivities (35% and 27%, respectively) at the beginning of the reaction due to undesired side reactions generating C1 and C2 hydrocarbons (hydrogenolysis; Supplementary 
). Platinum and Pt–Co catalysts also showed a significant deviation of material balance from unity (for example, for platinum, C
x
H
y
: 0.71 and CO
x
: 1.31; Supplementary 
), which suggests that dry reforming of C

H

to CO also occurred to a large extent. Conversely, the carbon balances in C
x
H
y
and CO
x
were close to unity for Pt–Co–In, indicating a minor contribution of dry reforming on the ternary alloy catalyst (Supplementary 
). The net C

H

selectivity and yield, which consider CO from C

H

as a by-product, were still high (86–97%, Supplementary 
and 47–44%, Supplementary 
, respectively). The hydrogen yield for Pt–Co–In was less than 5% (Supplementary 
), indicating that a large part of the hydrogen derived from C

H

was consumed by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This also suggests that the contribution of DDP versus CO

-ODP to the overall C

H

production, which is reflected roughly by the H

yield/C

H

yield ratio

, was very low (
∼
10%). Given that hydrogen can also be formed by dry reforming to a small extent, the actual contribution of DDP should be much lower than 10%. For the CO

conversion stability 
), a similar trend to that of C

H

was observed: only Pt–Co–In showed good stability, while other mono- and bimetallic catalysts were deactivated within 10 h. Interestingly, the initial conversion of CO

differed depending on the metal component in the following order: Pt–Co > Pt, Pt–Sn, Pt–Co–In
≫
Pt–In. This result implies that cobalt promotes CO

capture and activation as expected, and that alloying with indium alone significantly reduces this ability. Therefore, alloying platinum with both cobalt and indium may neutralize the negative effect of indium, thereby promoting the CO

conversion, comparable to the level achieved with monometallic platinum. Next, monometallic Co/CeO

and In/CeO

catalysts were also tested for the CO

-ODP as control experiments (Supplementary 
). Although Co/CeO

was active for both C

H

and CO

conversions at the beginning of the reaction, it rapidly deactivated within only 0.5 h (C

H

: 48% → 7%; CO

: 54% → 22%). After the deactivation, Co/CeO

retained the low CO

conversion (22%), which is probably due to the contribution of cobalt oxide species to CO

reduction

,

(Co/SiO

was not fully reduced by reduction at 600 °C; see H

-TPR, Supplementary 
). In/CeO

was almost inactive for both reactions. Therefore, the residual metallic cobalt and indium oxide species in Pt–Co–In/CeO

are unlikely to contribute to the high catalytic performance. We performed further control experiments using physical mixtures of the binary and monometallic catalysts (Pt–Co/CeO

+ In/CeO

, Pt–In/CeO

+ Co/CeO

and Co–In/CeO

+ Pt/CeO

) and Pt–In+Co/CeO

, where the cobalt cation was loaded on Pt–In/CeO

. Their catalytic activities and stabilities were much lower than those of Pt–Co–In/CeO

(Supplementary Figs.

–

), demonstrating that the ternary alloy structure with cobalt doped into Pt–In alloy is essential for a high catalytic performance. A temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) (Supplementary 
) and Raman analysis (Supplementary 
) of the spent catalysts after the 20 h catalytic run showed almost no coke accumulation on Pt–Co–In/CeO

, unlike the case with other deactivated catalysts. The average coke selectivity was calculated at 10 h by dividing the moles of accumulated coke by the total moles of converted C

H

and the carbon number of C

H

, which was lower than 0.1% (Supplementary 
).
The obtained high catalytic performance of Pt–Co–In/CeO

was compared with a number of reported systems for the CO

-ODP, considering the activity, selectivity, stability and CO

utilization efficiency (see Supplementary Tables

–

and Supplementary 
for details with references). For a better comparison, the catalytic performance of Pt–Co–In/CeO

at 600 °C (Supplementary 
) was also included. For alkane dehydrogenation, high catalytic activity is often achieved at the expense of selectivity and stability via the triggering of undesired side reactions

. Therefore, plotting stability or selectivity versus activity can be a good indication of the overall performance. More specifically, the mean catalyst life as a reciprocal deactivation constant (
\(\tau=k_{\mathrm{d}}^{-1}\)
) versus specific activity
\(\left( {{{{\mathrm{ml}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}\, {{{\mathrm{min}}}}^{ - 1}\, {\mathrm{g}}_{{{{\mathrm{cat}}}}}^{ - 1}} \right)\)
and the conversion–selectivity relationship were considered ,e
, respectively). The specific activity of our catalyst was approximately five times higher than typical values previously reported. This high catalytic activity is attributed to the use of platinum as the main active metal for the selective CO

-ODP. Moreover, the mean catalytic life of our catalyst at 550 °C was also higher than those previously reported. For the selectivity–conversion plot, we showed two selectivity descriptions for better comparison with reported systems, that is, we considered by-products other than C

such as CO (net C

selectivity in C

conversion region (>50%) 
), indicating its significant ability to suppress undesired side reactions. 
shows the plot of the CO

conversion versus the C

H

yield, which reflects the CO

utilization efficiency. A high CO

conversion with C

H

production in 1:1 stoichiometry (upper right in 
) is preferred for a high CO

utilization efficiency (see equation (

) for the definition of CO

utilization efficiency). In this context, our catalyst exhibited high CO

conversion and C

H

yield with near 1:1 stoichiometry, which compares favourably with previous systems, and achieved CO

utilization efficiencies of 53% at 550 °C and 70% at 600 °C (Supplementary 
). We also examined the reusability and long-term stability of Pt–Co–In/CeO

by applying a regeneration process. The regeneration of deactivated catalysts typically uses oxygen or air to combust deposited carbon. In this study, CO

was used instead as a soft oxidant for the Boudouard reaction because of its relatively easy handling. To switch the catalytic run to the regeneration process, the supply of C

H

was cut off to feed CO

/He for 5 h, followed by H

reduction for 0.5 h at the same temperature. CO

conversion was fully recovered by this process, and no negative effect on the C

H

conversion was observed ,h
; see Supplementary 
for C

H

selectivity). Although a slight decrease in C

H

conversion was observed, the conversion reached a steady state after 70 h and retained 33% conversion at 96 h. Thus, the Pt–Co–In/CeO

catalyst displayed multiple properties of outstanding catalytic activity, excellent C

H

selectivity, high CO

utilization efficiency, long-term stability and reusability. In 
, C

H

conversion was not fully recovered under the regeneration condition, indicating that coke on the active site for C

H

dehydrogenation is harder to remove than that for CO

activation. We also performed a control experiment with a DDP-CO

cycle test on Pt–Co–In/CeO

, where the gas feed was switched from C

H

/He (2 h) to CO

/He (0.5 h). Although the C

H

conversion decreased to near zero within 2 h in the absence of CO

, it was recovered by the CO

treatment (Supplementary 
). Thus, the Pt–Co–In/CeO

catalyst is highly capable of coke combustion by CO

, which enables continuous coke removal and long-term stability in CO

-ODP.
Mechanistic study
We also performed a mechanistic study to understand in depth the functions of cobalt, indium and CeO

in the catalysis. First, a kinetic analysis was conducted to understand the rate-determining step (RDS) of the CO

-ODP on Pt–Co–In/CeO

. The following reaction rate equation was considered for the CO

-ODP:
\(r_x = kP_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^\alpha P_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^\beta\)
, where
r
x
is the consumption rate of
x
(
x
= C

H

or CO

), and
\(P_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\)
and
\(P_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\)
are the pressures of C

H

and CO

, respectively. The experimental reaction orders were positive and could be higher than unity for
\(P_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\)
, while they were negative for
\(P_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\)

; see Supplementary 
for details). Here we considered a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism involving the two-step dehydrogenation of C

H

to C

H

, CO

reduction to CO, and oxidation of the eliminated hydrogen to form water 
). We solved the rate equation of each step by applying the quasi-stationary approximation and site conservation conditions (see Supplementary Note

for details). The ranges of predicted reaction orders were fully consistent with the experimental orders only when the CO

activation to form CO and O was regarded as the RDS (step 6 in 
). In addition, we conducted microkinetic modelling based on the transition state theory and steady-state approximation to estimate the forward and reverse reaction rates for each step (Supplementary Note

and Supplementary 
). For this modelling, some parameters calculated using density functional theory (DFT), such as activation energy (to be described later) and vibrational frequency, were used. As shown in 
(calculated reaction rate), step 6 showed the lowest rate. These results showed that the RDS of CO

-ODP on Pt–Co–In/CeO

was the CO

activation. Subsequently, the apparent activation energy (
E
A
*) was estimated for Pt–In/CeO

and Pt–Co–In/CeO

by Arrhenius-type plots. The
E
A
of CO

activation was significantly reduced (from 168.8 to 138.3 kJ mol
−1
) by the incorporation of cobalt into Pt–In 
and Supplementary 
), which is consistent with the experimental trend of the CO

conversion and turnover frequency (TOF), as shown in 
and Supplementary 
, respectively. We also simulated the dependences of the reaction rate on
\(P_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\)
and temperature using the kinetic modelling, both of which were found to be consistent with the experimental trends (Supplementary 
). This result strongly supports the validity of our kinetic model. Although the simulated values did not match exactly with the experimental ones, this may be due to insufficient accuracy in estimating the number of active sites. As suggested by the EXAFS study, small cobalt clusters are also present on CeO

, which complicates the interpretation of CO adsorption and the resulting metal dispersion (in this context, a more nuanced calibration of the number of active sites may improve the degree of agreement). Thus, the kinetic analysis revealed that alloying with cobalt kinetically promoted CO

activation, which is the RDS of the CO

-ODP. Compared with previously reported systems, Pt–Co–In/CeO

showed comparable

 Summary of the kinetic study of the CO2-ODP

We subsequently examined a series of Pt–Co–In catalysts using various supports, such as Al

O

, TiO

and ZrO

, to clarify the role of the CeO

support. Although these catalysts showed moderate initial conversions of C

H

and CO

, rapid deactivation occurred within 1–2 h ,b
). This result strongly indicates that the role of CeO

is to significantly enhance the catalyst stability; this is probably attributed to its coke combustion ability, as mentioned above. To confirm this ability, temperature-programmed surface reactions (TPSRs) were conducted using the coked catalysts under helium and CO

flows. The coked Pt–Co–In/CeO

evolved CO from 500 °C even in the absence of CO

(He-TPSR, 
), whereas the coked Pt–Co–In/Al

showed almost no CO evolution up to 600 °C.

The CO evolution from the coked Pt–Co–In/CeO

between 500 and 600 °C can be attributed to the coke combustion by the lattice oxygen of CeO

. Thus, CeO

can remove coke at the reaction temperature of the CO

-ODP (550 °C), whereas Al

O

cannot, which agrees with the stability trend in the CO

-ODP. Interestingly, intense CO evolution was observed from 600 °C for both catalysts, which might be due to the coke combustion by the oxygen atoms of the surface hydroxyl groups. When the TPSR experiment for the coked Pt–Co–In/CeO

was performed in the presence of CO

(CO

-TPSR, 
), a very large amount of CO (see the scale bars) was evolved starting at 500 °C, and the coke was completely combusted at 700 °C. This is clearly due to the continuous oxygen supply from CO

. The corresponding TPSR for the coked Pt/CeO

and Pt–In/CeO

showed similar CO evolutions at high temperatures (peak temperature: Pt–Co–In < Pt < Pt–In), although a low evolution was observed at 550 °C. These results are roughly consistent with the deactivation trend (Pt–Co–In < Pt, Pt–In) 
) and the CO

-reducing ability (Pt–Co–In, Pt > Pt–In) 
), which reflects the coke combustion abilities of these catalysts. Based on these results, we concluded that the coke combustion ability depended on the CO

-reducing ability of the metal nanoparticles and on the oxygen-releasing ability of CeO

. The concert of the ternary alloy and the specific character of the CeO

support enabled the continuous self-regeneration function and the remarkably high coke resistance. Furthermore, we verified the filling of oxygen vacancy after the lattice oxygen consumption of CeO

using a CO

-titration (TPO) technique and Pt/CeO

. As shown in 
, oxygen vacancies of CeO

were obtained by H

-TPR, followed by cooling and subsequent CO

-TPO. CO evolution was completed by 550 °C, indicating that CO

was divided into CO and O. The oxygen atoms were left on the catalyst. H

-TPR was repeated after CO

-TPO and cooling, where the reduction peak of CeO

appeared again 
). These results strongly support that the oxygen atoms derived from CO

refill the oxygen vacancies of CeO

.
Finally, we conducted DFT calculations to understand the role of the Pt–Co–In ternary alloy in the enhanced catalysis. As a model of the Pt–Co–In alloy surface, the stable surface of intermetallic Pt

In

was considered and one of the surface platinum atoms was replaced with cobalt, hereafter denoted as Pt

reduction, where CO

was first physisorbed, then chemisorbed with a bent
sp

-like conformation, followed by C–O bond scission to form CO and O, and lastly, CO desorption. The chemisorption was endothermic and required moderate energy barriers of 55–57 kJ mol
−1
. For Pt

In

and Pt

In

–Co, the CO on a top site of Pt/Co and O at an In–In bridge site were more stable than those on Pt, probably due to the oxophilicity of indium. CO was considerably more stable on cobalt than on platinum; therefore, the direct desorption of CO from the cobalt site required a high amount of energy (182.3 kJ mol
−1
). Relatively low-energy desorption is still allowed when CO migrates to the neighbouring platinum site. However, the microkinetic modelling showed that the constant and reaction rate for the desorption of product molecules were very high 
and Supplementary 
) due to the huge contribution of the translational partition function of gas-phase molecules at high temperatures. Thus, the direct desorption of CO from the cobalt site can occur smoothly even with the large energy barrier.

H

dehydrogenation, where two hydrogen atoms of C

H

are subsequently eliminated and moved to infinity (opposite surface of the slab). The two C–H activations were endothermic on the Pt

-based surfaces, whereas they were slightly exothermic on Pt, which may be dependent on whether the eliminated hydrogen atoms were located on a less stable Pt–Pt(Co) bridge site or on a highly stable Pt

hollow site. The high energy of the unstable hydrogen can be released after each C–H scission using the subsequent oxidation reaction (H + O → OH, Δ
E

summarizes the major energy barriers on each surface. The Pt surface was more active than the Pt

activations by cobalt substitution can be explained by the lowering of the final state energies 
) in line with the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship

. The cobalt atom strongly captures the carbon and/or hydrogen atom of the adsorbate, thus stabilizing the adsorbate state. The stronger adsorption on Co can be rationalized by the
d
band structure of alloys, as shown in 
. Alloying platinum with indium decreased the
d
band width and the density of states near the Fermi level. This change weakens the metal–adsorbate bonding in accordance with the

. In contrast, Pt

In

orbitals near the Fermi level, which recovers the adsorption strengths of carbon and hydrogen, hence promoting the conversion of CO

with Mars–van Krevelen-type (MvK) decoking by CeO

.
Full size image
Overall, the reaction mechanism of the CO

-ODP on Pt–Co–In/CeO

and the roles of the ternary alloy phase and the CeO

support are summarized in 
. Both the C

H

dehydrogenation and CO

reduction smoothly proceed on the Pt–Co active site to form 2H and O, as well as the main products: C

H

and CO. Alloying with indium enhances the C

H

selectivity due to the ensemble effect and decreases the amount of coke that accumulates on the catalyst surface. The doped cobalt improves the adsorption strengths of the carbon and hydrogen species, which promotes the activation of C

H

and CO

. The oxygen atoms oxidize the eliminated hydrogen to form H

O or combust coke on the alloy surface or neighbouring CeO

sites. Note that coke combustion is allowed when CO

conversion is higher than C

H

conversion because of the stoichiometry of the CO

-ODP. Coke can be combusted also by the lattice oxygen of CeO

, where CeO

is partially reduced to form an oxygen vacancy. This oxygen vacancy is refilled by an oxygen atom derived from CO

activation, enabling continuous coke combustion through the redox of CeO

. Thus, CeO

can facilitate coke combustion via a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism

, which significantly enhances the coke resistance and catalyst stability. Further information on the reaction mechanism can be obtained from the results of the DDP over Pt–Co–In/CeO

shown in Supplementary 
. It is worth noting that no CO
x
(CO and CO

) was formed at all during the DDP, indicating that lattice oxygen of CeO

does not combust C
x
H
y
. Thus, only carbonaceous species can be combusted by surface oxygen atom or lattice oxygen of CeO

. Moreover, C

H

conversion in the DDP at 550 °C was relatively high (30%) and close to the the equilibrium conversion (43%; Supplementary 
) at the beginning of the reaction. This indicates that Pt–Co–In/CeO

possesses a high catalytic activity for C–H activation even in the absence of CO

, although it was immediately deactivated due to the lack of coke combustion. These results suggest that CO

does not drastically change the kinetics of the dehydrogenation step, but mainly shifts the equilibrium limitation. Thus, C

H

dehydrogenation and CO

conversion are parallel to each other and linked by the hydrogen oxidation processes, which is highly consistent with the mechanism proposed in this study.
Discussion
We designed and prepared a Pt–Co–In ternary alloy on CeO

as a highly efficient catalyst for the CO

-ODP. This material comprises small nanoparticles (2–3 nm) with a (Pt

In

pseudo-binary alloy structure, where platinum, cobalt and indium are adjacent to each other on an atomic level. Pt–Co–In/CeO

exhibits outstanding catalytic activity, C

H

selectivity, long-term stability and CO

utilization efficiency. Alloying platinum with indium and cobalt significantly enhances the selectivity and activity, respectively, while the CeO

support drastically improves the catalyst stability by Mars–van Krevelen-type coke combustion. The results obtained in this study provide not only a highly efficient catalytic system for alkane dehydrogenation and CO

reduction, but also significant insights for material design based on multimetallic alloys.

The mixture was dried under a reduced pressure at 50 °C using a rotary evaporator, followed by calcination under flowing air at 500 °C for 1 h and reduction under flowing hydrogen (50 ml min

Characterization
The crystal structure of the prepared catalyst was examined by powder X-ray diffraction using a Rigaku MiniFlex II/AP diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. HAADF-STEM was carried out using a JEOL JEM-ARM200 M microscope equipped with an EDX analyser (EX24221M1G5T). STEM analysis was performed at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. To prepare the TEM specimen, all samples were sonicated in ethanol and then dispersed on a molybdenum grid supported by an ultrathin carbon film. For the particle size distribution, we counted 126 particles with ten high-resolution STEM images.
The TPO experiment was performed using BELCAT II (MicrotracBEL) to quantify the amount of coke deposited on the spent catalysts after 20 h of CO

-ODP at 550 °C (0.1 g of the catalyst with 0.9 g quartz sand). The spent catalyst placed in a quartz tube reactor was treated under flowing helium (30 ml min
−1
) at 150 °C for 30 min, followed by cooling to room temperature. Then, the catalyst bed temperature was increased (40–900 °C; ramping rate, 5 °C min
−1
) under flowing O

/He (50%, 40 ml min
−1
). The amount of CO

in the outlet gas was quantified by an online mass spectrometer. CO

- and He-TPSR experiments were performed for coked catalysts in a similar fashion using flows of CO

/He (10%, 30 ml min
−1
) and pure helium (30 ml min
−1
). The dispersion of platinum and cobalt in the catalysts (percentage of exposed Pt + Co to the total amount of Pt + Co) was measured by chemisorption of CO at room temperature. Before chemisorption, the catalyst (40 mg) was treated with 5% H

/Ar (30 ml min
−1
) at 550 °C for 0.5 h, followed by cooling to approximately −110 °C by liquid nitrogen with an helium purge (30 ml min
−1
). We then introduced a pulse of 10% CO/He into the reactor and quantified the CO passed through the catalyst bed using a thermal conductivity detector. This pulse measurement was repeated until no more CO was adsorbed. The dispersion was estimated assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry of CO adsorption on platinum and/or cobalt.
Laser Raman spectroscopy experiments were carried out using a JEOL NRS-5100 spectrometer at room temperature to investigate the carbonaceous deposits over the spent catalysts, with 2 cm
−1
resolution of the apparatus and a 532 nm excitation source.
XAFS spectra of the prepared catalysts were collected at the BL01B1 beamline of SPring-8, Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI) using Si (for Co K-edges and Pt L
III
-edges) and Si (for In K-edge) double-crystals as monochromators. Before the measurement, the catalyst was pelletized (
∼
150 mg with a diameter of 10 mm) and pretreated with H

/N

(20%, 40 ml min
−1
) at 550 °C for 0.5 h in an in situ quartz cell, followed by cooling to room temperature with nitrogen purge (32 ml min
−1
). The XAFS spectra were recorded in transmission (In K-edge) and fluorescence (Pt L
III
-edge and Co K-edge, using a 19-element germanium solid-state detector) modes at room temperature. Athena and Artemis softwares v.0.9.25 implemented in the Demeter package were used for the analysis of the obtained XAFS spectra. FEFF8 was used for the calculation of the back-scattering amplitude and phase-shift functions

. We defined the
R
factor (
R

) for curve-fitting as follows:
\(R^2 = {\Sigma}_i\left\{ {k^3\chi _i^{{\mathrm{exp}}}\left( k \right) - k^3\chi _i^{\mathrm{fit}}\left( k \right)} \right\}^2/{\Sigma}_i\left\{ {k^3\chi _i^{{\mathrm{exp}}}\left( k \right)} \right\}^2\)
.
XPS analysis for the catalysts was carried out using a JEOL JPS-9010MC (Mg Kα irradiation) spectrometer. The catalysts were reduced in a quartz tube reactor under flowing hydrogen (0.1 MPa, 20 ml min
–1
) at 550 °C for 30 min, then transferred into the spectrometer using a sealed vessel and an argon glovebox without exposing the samples to air. Binding energies were calibrated with the O 1
s
emission of CeO

as 529.9 eV.
Catalytic test
The CO

-ODP was performed in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with a 6 mm internal diameter under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (0.10 g), diluted with sea sand (0.90 g, Miyazaki Chemical, 99.9%), was treated under flowing hydrogen (10 ml min
–1
) at 550 °C for 0.5 h before the catalytic reactions. Then, the catalysts were evaluated by feeding the reactant gas mixture (C

H

:CO

:He = 1:1:2; total flow rate, 20 ml min
–1
). The gas phase was analysed and quantified using an online thermal conductivity detection gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A; Gaskuropack 54 column) fitted downstream. For all the catalysts, C

H

, C

were detected as reaction products in outlet gas. The C

H

and CO

conversions were defined as follows:
$${{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8\;{{{\mathrm{conversion}}}}\!:X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{in}} - F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$

$${{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2\;{{{\mathrm{conversion}}}}\!:X_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{in}} - F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$

where
\(F_x^{\mathrm{in}}\)
and
\(F_x^{\mathrm{out}}\)
indicate the inlet and outlet flow rates of
x
(ml min
−1
), respectively.
In this reaction, CO can be formed from C
x
H

by dry reforming as well as from CO

via reverse water-gas shift reaction, which were distinguished as follows:
$${{{\mathrm{CO}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{formed}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{from}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2\!:F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}^{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2} = F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{in}} - F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{out}}\,({{{\mathrm{ml}}}}\,{{{\mathrm{min}}}}^{ - 1})$$

$${{{\mathrm{CO}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{formed}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{from}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y\!:F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}^{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y} = F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}^{\mathrm{out}} - F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}^{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\,({{{\mathrm{ml}}}} \, {{{\mathrm{min}}}}^{ - 1})$$

Two different expressions of C

$$\begin{array}{l}{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6\;{{{\mathrm{selectivity}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{in}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y\!:S_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}^{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right)\\ = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}^{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}^{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}^{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_4}^{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{CH}}}}_4}^{\mathrm{out}}}} \times 100\end{array}$$

$${{{\mathrm{Net}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6\;{{{\mathrm{yield}}}}\!:Y_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8} \times S_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}}}{{100}}$$

H

yield was defined as follows:
$${{{\mathrm{H}}}}_2\;{{{\mathrm{yield}}}}\!:Y_{{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_2}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$

Material balance was considered using the following scales:
$${{{\mathrm{Carbon}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{balance}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{in}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}^{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}^{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_4}^{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{CH}}}}_4}^{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$

$${{{\mathrm{Carbon}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{balance}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{in}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_x = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}^{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$

$$\begin{array}{l}{{{\mathrm{Total}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{carbon}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{balance}}}}\\ = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}^{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}^{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_4}^{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{CH}}}}_4}^{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}^{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y} + F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}^{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{in}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100\end{array}$$

$${{{\mathrm{Oxygen}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{balance}}}} = \frac{{2F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}^{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{O}}}}}^{\mathrm{out}}}}{{2F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$

Deactivation constant, mean catalyst life, CO

utilization efficiency, TOF, average coke selectivity and the turnover number of coke were defined as follows:
$$\begin{array}{l}{{{\mathrm{Deactivation}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{constant}}}}\!:k_{{{\mathrm{d}}}}\\ = \left\{ {{{{\mathrm{ln}}}}\left( {\frac{{1 - X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{f}}}}{{X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{f}}}}} \right) - {{{\mathrm{ln}}}}\left( {\frac{{1 - X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{i}}}}{{X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{i}}}}} \right)} \right\}\left( {t^{\mathrm{f}} - t^{\mathrm{i}}} \right)^{ - 1}\end{array}$$

$${{{\mathrm{Mean}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{catalyst}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{life}}}}\!:\tau = \frac{1}{{k_{\mathrm{d}}}}$$

$${{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}\;{{{\mathrm{utilization}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{efficiency}}}}\,({{{\mathrm{\% }}}}) = X_{\mathrm{{CO}_{2}}}\left( {1 - \frac{{\left| {X_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}} - Y_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_{3}{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_{6}}} \right|}}{{X_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}} + Y_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_{3}{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_{6}}}}} \right)$$

$${{{\mathrm{TOF}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8/{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\left( {{{{\mathrm{site}}}}^{ - 1}\,{{{\mathrm{min}}}}^{ - 1}} \right) = \frac{{M_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8/{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{{\mathrm{in}}} \times X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8/{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{i}}}}{{n_{{{{\mathrm{Pt}}}} + {{{\mathrm{Co}}}}} \times D}}$$

$${{{\mathrm{TON}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{coke}}}}}\left( {{{{\mathrm{site}}}}^{ - 1}} \right) = \frac{{n_{{{\mathrm{C}}}}^t}}{{n_{{{{\mathrm{Pt}}}} + {{{\mathrm{Co}}}}} \times D}}$$

where
\(X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{i}}\)
and
\(X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}^{\mathrm{f}}\)
indicate the initial (

, respectively.
\(M_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8/{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{in}}\)
and
\(M_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8/{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}^{\mathrm{out}}\)
are the inlet and outlet molar flow rates (mol min

, respectively.
n

correspond to the moles of active metal in the catalyst and its dispersion estimated by CO chemisorption, respectively.
\(n_{{{\mathrm{C}}}}^t\)
indicates moles of coke accumulated at time on stream of

) represents the degree of deviation between
\(X_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\)
and
\(Y_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}\)
. We also used a flame ionization detection gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14B; Porapak-Q column) equipped with a methanizer (Shimadzu MTN-1) to detect oxygenated products. All the catalytic tests for kinetic analysis were performed under differential conditions by adjusting the catalyst amount, where the reactant conversion was lower than 15% (typically 5–10%).
Computational details
Periodic DFT calculations were performed using the CASTEP code

with Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseudopotentials and the revised version of the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof exchange−correlation functional based on the generalized gradient approximation

. The plane-wave basis set was truncated at a kinetic energy of 360 eV. A Fermi smearing of 0.1 eV was utilized. Dispersion correlations were considered using the Tkatchenko–Scheffler method with a scaling coefficient of
s
R
= 0.94 and a damping parameter of
d
= 20 (
). The reciprocal space was sampled using a
k
-point mesh with a spacing of typically 0.04 Å
−1
, as generated by the Monkhorst−Pack scheme

. Geometry optimizations and transition state (TS) searches were performed on supercell structures using periodic boundary conditions. The surfaces were modelled using metallic slabs with a thickness of four atomic layers with 13 Å of vacuum spacing. We chose Pt

 as the most stable surface; this has the highest surface atom density and diffraction intensity

(–Co). Geometry optimizations were performed using the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm

. The unit cell size of the bulk material (Pt and Pt

In

) was first optimized, followed by modelling the slab structure and surface relaxation with the size of the supercell fixed. The convergence criteria for structure optimization and energy calculation were set to an SCF tolerance of 1.0 × 10
−6
eV per atom, an energy tolerance of 1.0 × 10
−5
eV per atom, a maximum force tolerance of 0.05 eV Å
−1
and a maximum displacement tolerance of 1.0 × 10
−3
Å.
The adsorption energy was defined as follows:
E
ad
=
E
A-S
– (
E
S
+
E
A
), where
E
A-S
is the energy of the slab together with the adsorbate,
E
A
is the total energy of the free adsorbate and
E
S
is the total energy of the bare slab. The adsorption energy for an oxygen-preadsorbed slab was calculated using
E
SH
, which is the total energy of the oxygen-adsorbed slab, instead of using
E
S
. The
d
band centre (
ε
d
) was defined as the average energy of the occupied
d
band relative to the Fermi level as follows:
$$\varepsilon _{{{\mathrm{d}}}} = {\int}_{ - \infty }^0 {E\rho _{{{\mathrm{d}}}}\left( E \right){{{\mathrm{d}}}}E} /{\int}_{ - \infty }^0 {\rho _{{{\mathrm{d}}}}\left( E \right){{{\mathrm{d}}}}E}$$

where
ρ
d
is the density of states projected to
d
orbitals.
The TS search was performed using the complete linear synchronous transit/quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) method

,

. Linear synchronous transit maximization was performed, followed by energy minimization in the directions conjugating to the reaction pathway. The approximated TS was used to perform QST maximization with conjugate gradient minimization refinements. This cycle was repeated until a stationary point was found. The convergence criterion for the TS calculations was set to the r.m.s. forces on an atom tolerance of 0.05 eV Å
−1
.
The activation energy (
E
A
) was determined as the largest energy barrier among all the focused steps: for CO

conversion this was CO

activation, and for C

H

conversion this was the first or second C–H activations. We also consider theoretical apparent activation energy,
E
A
*, for comparison with the experimental values. This is identical to
E
A
except when the initial state for
E
A
is a weakly adsorbed state, such as physisorption, where the apparent activation energy should be expressed as

Vibrational frequencies of the adsorbates were computed by phonon calculation based on harmonic approximation using the finite displacement method in CASTEP. Fractional positions of all the metal atoms were fixed so that only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms were considered for phonon calculation. The contribution of solid surface to the vibrational terms, which is typically much lower than that of adsorbates, was ignored. The threshold for energy convergence for each iteration was set to 10
−10
eV per atom. The entropy (
S
), Gibbs free energy (
G
) and partition function (
q
) of each species were estimated at 550 °C using the calculated vibrational frequencies (
ν
n
) as follows

:
$$G\left( {T,P} \right) = E_{\mathrm{e}} + E_{\mathrm{trans}} + E_{\mathrm{rot}} + E_{\mathrm{vib}} + PV - T\left( {S_{\mathrm{trans}} + S_{\mathrm{rot}} + S_{\mathrm{vib}}} \right)$$

where

$$E_{\mathrm{trans}} = \frac{3}{2}RT$$

$$E_{\mathrm{rot}} = RT$$

(for a linear molecule)
$$E_{\mathrm{rot}} = \frac{3}{2}RT$$

(for a nonlinear molecule)
$$E_{\mathrm{vib}} = R\mathop {\sum}\nolimits_n {\frac{{h\nu _n}}{{k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}}}\left( {\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{{{\mathrm{e}}^{h\nu _n/k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T} - 1}}} \right)}$$

$$S_{\mathrm{trans}} = R\left( {\ln q_{\mathrm{trans}} + \frac{5}{2}} \right)$$

where
$$q_{\mathrm{trans}} = \left( {\frac{{2\uppi mk_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T}}{{h^2}}} \right)^{3/2}\frac{{k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T}}{P}$$

$$S_{\mathrm{rot}} = R\left( {\ln q_{\mathrm{rot}} + 1} \right)$$

(for a linear molecule), where
$$q_{\mathrm{rot}} = \frac{1}{\sigma }\left( {\frac{{8\uppi ^2k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T}}{{h^2}}} \right) \times I$$

$$S_{\mathrm{rot}} = R\left( {\ln q_{\mathrm{rot}} + \frac{3}{2}} \right)$$

(for a nonlinear molecule), where
$$q_{\mathrm{rot}} = \frac{{\sqrt \uppi }}{\sigma }\left( {\frac{{8\uppi ^2k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T}}{{h^2}}} \right)^{3/2} \times \sqrt {I_xI_yI_z}$$

$$S_{\mathrm{vib}} = R\mathop {\sum }\limits_n \left( {\frac{{h\nu _n/k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}}}{{{\mathrm{e}}^{h\nu _n/k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T} - 1}} - \ln \left( {1 - {\mathrm{e}}^{ - h\nu _n/k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T}} \right)} \right)$$

where

is the Planck constant,
k
B
is the Boltzmann constant and
m
is the mass of the molecule. For surface species, the rotational and translational contributions were converted into vibrational modes and the
PV
term was approximated to be negligible compared with the energetic terms; therefore, the Gibbs free energy for surface species was considered as follows:
\(G\left( {T,P} \right) = E_{\mathrm{e}} + E_{\mathrm{vib}} - TS_{\mathrm{vib}}\)
. Spurious frequencies lower than 100 cm
−1
were replaced with 50 cm
−1
for all the structures to provide consistent results as reported in the literature

. The properties of the reactant (C

H

and CO

) and product (C

H

, CO and H

O) molecules in the gas phase were calculated using an ideal gas approximation at 550 °C and their translational and rotational contributions were evaluated at relative pressures (
P
/
P

) of 0.24 and 0.01, respectively.
