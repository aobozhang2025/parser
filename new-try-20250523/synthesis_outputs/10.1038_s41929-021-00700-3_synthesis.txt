Synthesis of the support
Mg(NO

)

·6H

O (99.97% metals basis, Alfa Aesar) and Na

CO

were purchased and used as received. Deionized water was further purified using a Merck Millipore Synergy Ultrapure Water System and had a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C. The well-defined single-crystalline MgO nanosheets as the support were prepared according to a previously reported procedure

. A Na

CO

aqueous solution (100 ml, 0.5 M) was rapidly added into 400 ml of a Mg(NO

)

aqueous solution (0.125 M) under vigorous stirring at room temperature. After 10 min, the precipitation was collected via filtration, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried under a reduced pressure. The yielded white powder was transferred into an alumina crucible and calcined at 500 °C (the ramping rate was controlled at 2 °C min
–1
) for 2 h under an air atmosphere. The MgO product was added into deionized water (1 mg ml
–1
) under stirring at room temperature. After 1 h, the product was collected via filtration and dried under a reduced pressure. the Mg(OH)

product was heated to 600 °C for 12 h under a high vacuum. During both the ramping and heating processes, the reactor was evacuated with pressure lower than 10
–5
mbar. The ramping rate was 1 °C min
–1
. The final product was collected and stored in an argon-filled glove box, denoted as MgO-NS and used as the support.

Synthesis of Ir-based catalysts
(Acetylacetonato)(1,5-cyclooctadiene)iridium(I) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Pentane was dried using an MBraun solvent purification system (SPS 800), and stored in the presence of 4 Å molecule sieves in a glove box. Synthetic air and H

were purified over activated 4 Å molecular sieves. All the experiments (support handling, material synthesis, storage and regular characterization) were performed under a N

or Ar atmosphere in an MBraun UNIlab glove box (water and oxygen levels were kept below 0.1 ppm) or standard Schlenk techniques. Elemental analyses were performed by Mikroanalytisches Labor Pascher.
To MgO-NS (200 mg) dispersed in pentane (20 ml) in a 50 ml Schlenk flask was added a solution of Ir(COD)(acac) (4.15 mg) in pentane (2 ml) under stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. After removing the solvent in vacuo, the resulting material was washed with pentane and dried under a high vacuum (10
–5
mbar) to give Ir(COD)(acac)/MgO (elemental analysis, Ir, 0.9%; Ir:C ≈ 1:15). The 0.1 wt% sample was prepared in the same manner using 0.4 mg of Ir(COD)(acac).
Ir(COD)(acac)/MgO was added to a tubular glass flow reactor supported by a frit. The reactor was heated, ramping at 1 °C min
–1
to 400 °C and kept at 400 °C for 12 h under a steady flow of synthetic air. After cooling down to room temperature, the reactor was evacuated under a high vacuum to yield a light-yellow powder and denoted as Ir/MgO-cal (elemental analysis, Ir, 0.9%).

and 10 ml of acetylacetone were added. The mixture was heated to 135 °C under N

and allowed to reflux for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, a yellow precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with acetylacetone and dichloromethane (~75 %yield). The yellow solid was dissolved in H

Ir(O,O-acac)

(C-acac)(py) was synthesized as follows. A concentrated water solution of Ir(O,O-acac)

(C-acac)(H

O) that contained 200 mg of the above complex was mixed with 20 ml of CHCl

and 2 ml of pyridine. The mixture was stirred and heated at 60 °C overnight. The solvent was removed under vacuum to give a quantitative yield of Ir(O,O-acac)

Synthesis of Ir/SiO
, IrO

and Ir/MgO-NP
Silica-supported Ir nanoparticles were prepared as a reference according to a previously reported method

. Iridium oxide materials were synthesized via a modified chlorine-free Adams fusion method

,

.
MgO-NP-supported Ir single site catalysts were prepared as follows. To MgO-NP (200 mg; see the first step in the preparation of the MgO nanosheet support (Synthesis of the support)) in pentane (20 ml) in a 50 ml Schlenk flask was added Ir(COD)(acac) (0.4 mg) dissolved in pentane (2 ml) with stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. After solvent removal, the material was washed with pentane, dried under a high vacuum (10
–5
mbar) and calcined using the same protocol as for Ir/MgO-cal. The thus-obtained light-yellow powder was denoted as Ir/MgO-NP.
Infrared spectroscopy characterization
All the infrared measurements were conducted using a Bruker FT-IR Alpha spectrometer equipped with a middle infrared source placed inside a glove box, and the OPUS software used. For the transmission mode, self-supported pellets of the interested sample were pressed without dilution. For the attenuated total reflectance mode, a platinum attenuated total reflectance accessory was used. All the measurements consisted of 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm
–1
and then were averaged.
Self-supporting pellets of Ir(COD)(acac)/MgO was compressed and submitted to an atmosphere of CO (or isotope-labelled CO). The pressure of the CO was kept lower than 10 mbar to prevent the migration of Ir unless specified. For the isotope-labelled study, a mixture of

CO and

CO was used instead of pure CO. After CO adsorption, the sample was measured using the FT infrared method described above.
For comparison, MgO-NS-supported Ir(CO)

(acac) and acetylacetone were prepared. (Acetylacetonato)dicarbonylrhodium(I) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. For Ir(CO)

(acac)/MgO, 200 mg of MgO-NS was added to a 50 ml Schlenk flask and dispersed by 20 ml of pentane. Ir(CO)

(acac) (3.6 mg) was dissolved in pentane to give a light-yellow solution and added to the MgO suspension during stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred for 3 h at room temperature before the solvent was removed. The material was washed with pentane and dried under a high vacuum (10
–5
mbar) and denoted as Ir(CO)

(acac)/MgO.
For MgO-supported acetylacetone, 50 mg of MgO-NS was added to a 50 ml Schlenk flask and dispersed by 20 ml of pentane. Diluted acetylacetone in pentane (2.6 μmol acetylacetone) was added to the MgO suspension with stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred for 3 h at room temperature before the solvent was removed. The material was washed with pentane and dried under a high vacuum (10
–5
mbar) and denoted as Hacac/MgO.
XAS study
The XAS measurement at the Ir LIII edge was carried out at the SuperXAS beamline at the Swiss Light Source (PSI). The storage ring was operated at 2.4 GeV in the top-up mode with a ring current of around 400 mA. The incident photon beam provided by a 2.9 T superbend magnet was selected by a Si quick-EXAFS monochromator. The beam size on the sample was 100 × 100 μm. During measurements, the monochromator was rotated with a 1 Hz frequency in a 2° angular range and X-ray absorption spectra were collected in the transmission mode using ionization chambers specially developed for quick data collection with a 1 MHz frequency. The beam-line energy was calibrated with iridium foil to the Ir LIII edge position at 11,215 eV. To avoid contact with air, the potentially air-sensitive samples were sealed in aluminium plastic bags (polyaniline (15 μm), polyethylene (15 μm), Al (12 μm) and polyethylene (75 μm) from Gruber-Folien GmbH & Co. KG) inside a glove box. Data processing was done by standard procedures using the ProXASGui software developed at the SuperXAS beamline, PSI.
The program package Demeter was used for the data analysis. Simulations of EXAFS scattering paths to conduct fits of the experimental data were calculated using the ab initio self-consistent field computational code FEFF8.2. The model of bulk IrO

and the Ir(COD)(acac) complex was built with the Diamond program. Coordinates of the model were then used in the FEFF input file. S0

values for the Ir LIII edge were obtained by fitting the pristine complex and the standard IrO

reference. Coordination numbers were fixed for both cases. The workup of raw XAFS data to the
k
-space and Fourier transformed
R
-space involved energy calibration, background subtraction and
µ

fitting. All the data were processed using a consistent methodology of background subtraction, conversion to
k
-space and conversion to FT
R
-space. Δ
E

values were correlated for multipath fitting. No other parameters were fixed, constrained or correlated during the fitting.
Electron microscopy study
TEM images of Ir/SiO

were recorded on an FEI Talos F200X instrument. The TEM sample was prepared inside a glove box (under an atmosphere of Ar) by directly depositing the sample powder on a Lacey-C 300 mesh Cu grid. The loaded grid was then mounted on a vacuum transfer tomography holder from Fischione Instruments (model no. 2560) and transferred to the chamber of the TEM without air contact. High-resolution ADF-STEM images of Ir/MgO-cal were obtained on an aberration-corrected JEM ARM300F (Grand ARM) transmission electron microscope within the facilities of ScopeM. For the STEM measurement, the TEM samples were prepared in air.
XPS study
XPS was performed at ETH Zurich using the SIGMA II instrument equipped with an Al/Mg twin anode. The vacuum in the chamber was around 2.2 × 10
−8
mbar during the measurements. The experiment was conducted using an Al Kα source (energy = 1,486.6 eV) in the LAXPS mode. The beam was operated at 13.7 mA and 15 kV (200 W). The data analysis was performed using CasaXPS utilizing a linear background. Peak fits were achieved using Gaussian–Lorentzian (GL30) line shapes. The Ir 4
f
doublet separation was fixed at 3.0 eV.
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy–UV–vis study
Diffuse reflectance spectra were measured at room temperature using an Agilent Cary 5000 UV–vis near infrared spectrometer (200–800 nm at a 10 nm s
−1
scan rate) equipped with a Harrick Scientific Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory. Samples were placed in a sample chamber with quartz windows to preserve the inert (argon) atmosphere.
NMR study
Solution

H NMR and

C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker DRX 300 and a Bruker DRX 400. The chemical shift was referenced relative to the residual solvent peak and reported relative to tetramethylsilane. All the ssNMR were acquired on a Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer operating at a 400 MHz

H frequency (9.4 T) and equipped with a 3.2 mm

H X MAS probe (Bruker). The MAS frequency was set to 16 kHz. Proton-detected

H,

C correlation experiments were acquired with D-HMQC, using a similar protocol to that we reported before

.
Catalytic performance evaluation
Benzene and benzene-
d

were distilled from sodium in the presence of benzophenone, degassed via three freeze–pump–thaw cycles and stored over 4 Å molecule sieves in a glove box. In a Fisher-Porter reactor, 100 mg of Ir/MgO-cal and 3 ml of benzene were introduced. After freezing benzene with liquid nitrogen, the reactor was evacuated at 10
–5
mbar. The reactor was allowed to warm to room temperature and filled with ethylene (3.5, Pangas) to 3 bar. The reaction was carried out at 180 °C for 3 h. The liquid mixture and spent catalyst was then collected inside the glove box. Catalytic tests were evaluated using gas chromatography–flame ionization detection (Agilent Technologies 7890 A) equipped with a split/splitless injector heated to 250 °C, injection volume 0.5 μl and hydrogen as the carrier gas.
Isotope labelling experiments

C-benzene,

C-ethylene and ethylene-
d

were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. Benzene-
d

(99.5% D) was purchased from Eurisotop. The procedures were the same as that for the catalytic performance evaluation.
