synthesis of SA/hydrogenated ZnO. The magnitude of the y-axis in the above EPR data is identical. a, The EPR data of pristine ZnO and Pt -DSA/ZnO. The intensity of the original EPR signal related to bulk V O diminished after Pt deposition, which is the evidence of photo -induced surface V O consumption upon Pt deposition (b). This decrease in signal could provide evidence of a specific interaction between exerted metal atoms and the surface V O on the support. b, After the reduction in an H 2/Ar atmosphere, the total intensity of the EPR signal related to V O decreased significantly. Fu rthermore, there was no diminution in the VO signal after Pt deposition. conventional wet -impregnation synthesis of SA/hydrogenated CeO 2. The magnitude of the y-axis in the above EPR data is identical. a, The EPR data of pristine Ce O2 and Pt -DSA /CeO2. The intensity of the original EPR signal s related to Ce3+ and especially Ce3+-O--Ce4+ decreased after Pt deposition, which is the evidence of photo -induced surface V O consumption upon Pt deposition ( c ). This decrease in signal could provide evi dence of a specific interaction between exerted metal atoms and the surface V O on the support. b, After the reduction in an H2/Ar atmosphere, the total intensity of the EPR signal s decreased significantly. Fu rthermore, there was no diminution in the EPR signal s after Pt deposition.
