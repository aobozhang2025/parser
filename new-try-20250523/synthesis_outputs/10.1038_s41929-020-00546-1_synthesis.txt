indicates that, because of the identical synthesis method, the majority of the catalytic active sites
in Co(mIm)-NC(1.0) is likely the porphyrin-like CoN C . We notice that result from literature

(Nat. Mater. 14, 937-94211; Nat. Commun. 8, 957-96710; Nat. Catal. 1, 63-
7256) also shows the similar active site structures of Co-N-C versus Fe-N-C from same
synthesis.
Furthermore, we have compared our experimental XANES result with the XANES simulations
of Zitolo et al. (Nat. Mater. 14, 937-94211). The XANES result of Fe(mIm)-NC(1.0) is
similar to that of Zitolo et al. Thus, as concluded by Zitolo et al., the best match of the XANES
simulations for FeN is in the porphyrinic coordination environment, i.e., FeN C , as shown in
