Synthesis of Pt NPs Pt NPs were synthesized by following a previously reported method with a slight modification 43 . Platinum chloride was dissolved in deionized water (0.002 g ml –1 ) and boiled at 100 °C for 1 min. Subsequently, the prepared trisodium citrate solution (0.011 g ml –1 ) and sodium borohydride solution (0.76 mg ml –1 ) were added to the platinum chloride solution. The resulting mixture solution was stirred at 80 °C for 10 min, and the colour change of the solution from yellow to black indicated the successful synthesis of Pt NPs. The final Pt NP solution, with acetone as an anti-solvent, was centrifuged at 1,555 rpm for 20 min. The concentration of Pt NPs was measured using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICPS-8100) at the National Center for Inter-University Research Facilities, Seoul National University. Synthesis of Pt/TiO 2 cryoeaeorgels The Pt NP solution (20 mg ml –1 ) was added to TiO 2 NP dispersion to obtain a Pt/TiO 2 colloidal solution (17 wt% Pt). The Pt/TiO 2 colloidal solution was homogeneously mixed using an ultrasonic liquid processor (Vibcra-Cell, VCX-750) for 2 h (40% amplitude), and the mixed solution was added dropwise to liquid nitrogen. After flash freezing for 10 min, the frozen solution was brought to a freeze dryer (Operon, FDU-7003) and kept under a vacuum (<20 mtorr) for 48 h. Synthesis of Cu-SA/TiO 2 NPs The synthesis procedure is based on a previously reported method 2 with appropriate modifications. Synthesis of silica NP template. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (0.86 ml) was added into mixed solutions of H 2 O (4.30 ml) and EtOH (23.00 ml) and stirred for 6 h. The products were centrifuged and washed with water and EtOH and redispersed in anhydrous EtOH (40 ml) for the next procedure. TiO 2 coating on the SiO 2 template. Acetonitrile (14.0 ml) and 28–30 wt% ammonia solution (0.4 ml) were added into the previously made SiO 2 NP solution (solution 1). The mixture was sonicated for 10 min. Another solution (solution 2) was made with titanium ( iv ) butoxide (0.8 ml) dissolved in a mixture of anhydrous EtOH (6.0 ml) and acetonitrile (2.0 ml). Solution 2 was added to solution 1 and stirred for 3 h. The products were centrifuged and washed with EtOH and water twice each and redispersed in H 2 O (40 ml) for the next step. Cu-SA adsorption on TiO 2 -coated SiO 2 NPs. Copper ( ii ) chloride dihydrate (4.0 mg) was added to the previously made TiO 2 -coated SiO 2 NP solution. The mixture was stirred for 3 h. The light-blue powder was centrifuged, washed with water and redispersed in H 2 O for the following procedure. Wrapping SiO 2 . Polyvinylpyrrolidone (0.4 g) was added to the solution in above and stirred overnight. The polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated product was centrifuged and redispersed in a solution of EtOH (46 ml) and H 2 O (9 ml). Tetraethyl orthosilicate (1.6 ml) and 28–30 wt% ammonia solution (1.2 ml) were added to the above solution. The reaction was conducted for 4 h. The product was centrifuged and washed with EtOH and water. The resulting powders were dried at 80 °C in an electric oven overnight. Redistribution of Cu atoms. The product obtained in step was calcined at 900 °C for 2 h. Etching SiO 2 for hollow Cu-SA/TiO 2 NPs. The calcined powder in step was dispersed in a 0.5 M sodium hydroxide solution. The solution was heated to 180 °C with stirring. After 6 h of reaction, the product was centrifuged and washed with H 2 O and EtOH. The resulting powder was dried at 80 °C in an electric oven overnight. Synthesis of Pt/g-C 3 N 4 NPs For the synthesis of g-C 3 N 4 , 5 g of urea was transferred to an alumina boat and calcined at 550 °C for 2 h inside a muffle furnace. Then, 50 mg of the synthesized g-C 3 N 4 was dispersed in a 20 ml gas-tight vial with 10 ml of 20% methanol aqueous solution. Chloroplatinic acid with an equivalent amount of 4 wt% Pt regarding g-C 3 N 4 was added to the reaction solution. The solution in the reaction cell was irradiated with ultraviolet–visible light (100 mW cm –2 ) under vigorous stirring. After 2 h, the product was washed with water and EtOH and dried at 50 °C in an electric oven overnight. Fabrication of floatable photocatalytic elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposites To fabricate the photocatalytic layer, 3 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50.0 wt%) was prepared and EtOH was added to set the concentration of HPU as 10.5 wt%. NaCl was added to the HPU solution (final concentration of NaCl, 0.032 g ml –1 ), and 30 mg of photocatalysts was added to the HPU solution. After vigorous stirring, PPG was added to the HPU solution with a volume ratio of 1:2 (PPG:HPU). A mixed sol–gel state was obtained after the addition of PPG, and the gel phase was separated after 24 h. After moulding the gel into a circular shape with a diameter of 6 cm, EtOH and water in the gel phase were removed by drying at 60 °C for two days, and the gel phase was reswollen in water to remove NaCl granules in the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite. The separated gel phase (photocatalytic layer) was fully swollen in water, and hydrophobic silica aerogel was added to the top surface of the photocatalytic layer. The fabrication of a supporting layer follows the same procedures, except starting with 16 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50 wt%) and skipping the addition of photocatalysts. The bilayer system of the nanocomposite was fabricated by integrating the photocatalytic layer and supporting layer with the aid of EtOH. EtOH was added dropwise on the top surface of the supporting layer, and the photocatalytic layer was attached to the supporting layer. The bilayer system was dried at 60 °C for 24 h to remove EtOH and reswollen in water. Fabrication of PAM nanocomposites The acrylamide/bis-acrylamide solution (19:1) was added to the as-prepared acrylamide solution (0.156 g ml –1 ). Subsequently, a 10 wt% ammonium persulfate solution was added to the solution. The solution was degassed for 5 min. Then, 30 mg Pt/TiO 2 cryoaerogel and tetramethylethylenediamine solution were sequentially added. The resulting solution was poured into a circular mould with a diameter of 6 cm, and cured under ultraviolet irradiation for 2 h. Material
