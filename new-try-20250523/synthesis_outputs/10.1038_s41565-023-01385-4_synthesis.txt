Synthesis of Pt NPs
Pt NPs were synthesized by following a previously reported method with a slight modification

. Platinum chloride was dissolved in deionized water (0.002 g ml

The resulting mixture solution was stirred at 80 °C for 10 min, and the colour change of the solution from yellow to black indicated the successful synthesis of Pt NPs. The final Pt NP solution, with acetone as an anti-solvent, was centrifuged at 1,555 rpm for 20 min. The concentration of Pt NPs was measured using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICPS-8100) at the National Center for Inter-University Research Facilities, Seoul National University.

O and EtOH. The resulting powder was dried at 80 °C in an electric oven overnight.

Synthesis of Pt/g-C
N

NPs
For the synthesis of g-C

N

, 5 g of urea was transferred to an alumina boat and calcined at 550 °C for 2 h inside a muffle furnace. Then, 50 mg of the synthesized g-C

N

was dispersed in a 20 ml gas-tight vial with 10 ml of 20% methanol aqueous solution. Chloroplatinic acid with an equivalent amount of 4 wt% Pt regarding g-C

N

was added to the reaction solution. The solution in the reaction cell was irradiated with ultraviolet–visible light (100 mW cm
–2
) under vigorous stirring. After 2 h, the product was washed with water and EtOH and dried at 50 °C in an electric oven overnight.
Fabrication of floatable photocatalytic elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposites
To fabricate the photocatalytic layer, 3 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50.0 wt%) was prepared and EtOH was added to set the concentration of HPU as 10.5 wt%. NaCl was added to the HPU solution (final concentration of NaCl, 0.032 g ml
–1
), and 30 mg of photocatalysts was added to the HPU solution. After vigorous stirring, PPG was added to the HPU solution with a volume ratio of 1:2 (PPG:HPU). A mixed sol–gel state was obtained after the addition of PPG, and the gel phase was separated after 24 h. After moulding the gel into a circular shape with a diameter of 6 cm, EtOH and water in the gel phase were removed by drying at 60 °C for two days, and the gel phase was reswollen in water to remove NaCl granules in the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite. The separated gel phase (photocatalytic layer) was fully swollen in water, and hydrophobic silica aerogel was added to the top surface of the photocatalytic layer. The fabrication of a supporting layer follows the same procedures, except starting with 16 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50 wt%) and skipping the addition of photocatalysts. The bilayer system of the nanocomposite was fabricated by integrating the photocatalytic layer and supporting layer with the aid of EtOH. EtOH was added dropwise on the top surface of the supporting layer, and the photocatalytic layer was attached to the supporting layer. The bilayer system was dried at 60 °C for 24 h to remove EtOH and reswollen in water.
Fabrication of PAM nanocomposites
The acrylamide/bis-acrylamide solution (19:1) was added to the as-prepared acrylamide solution (0.156 g ml
–1
). Subsequently, a 10 wt% ammonium persulfate solution was added to the solution. The solution was degassed for 5 min. Then, 30 mg Pt/TiO

cryoaerogel and tetramethylethylenediamine solution were sequentially added. The resulting solution was poured into a circular mould with a diameter of 6 cm, and cured under ultraviolet irradiation for 2 h.
Material characterizations

Molecular weight analysis of HPU was performed by gel permeation chromatography at the National Instrumentation Center for Environmental Management (NICEM), Seoul National University.

Transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-2100F) observation was performed at 200 kV. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; Oxford, X-MAX 80T) was operated at 200 kV.

The absorption spectra of the catalysts were measured using ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (V-770) at the Research Institute of Advanced Materials, Seoul National University. Powder-type photocatalysts were placed on the detection spot. Then, the absorption spectra of the photocatalysts were measured from 200 to 800 nm. The absorption intensity was normalized by dividing the intensity by the maximum absorption intensity.

The density of the photocatalysts was obtained by calculating the ratio of mass and volume. Since the weight of the photocatalysts underwater is equal to its volume, the volume of the photocatalysts was set as the weight of the photocatalysts in the aqueous solution.

The cross section of the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss) operated at 2.00 kV at NICEM, Seoul National University. The mass ratio of Si at each point of the cross section of the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite was obtained by EDS (FlatQuad, AURIGA) operated at 11.3 kV at NICEM, Seoul National University.

The contact angles were measured using a contact angle analyser (KRÜSS, DSA25). A sessile drop method was used at room temperature (20.0 °C) for the measurement.

The porosity was calculated using the following equation:
\({{{\mathrm{Porosity}}}}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \left( {1 - \frac{{W_\mathrm{d}}}{{W_{\mathrm{fs}}}}} \right) \times 100\)
, where
W
fs
and
W
d
denote the mass of the fully swollen hydrogel sample and mass of the hydrogel sample of which water in the pores was eliminated, respectively.

The floatability of the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel composite was determined by measuring the equilibrium density. The floatable nanocomposites were located in deionized water (density, 1.000 g ml
–1
), and the pre-calculated amount of acetonitrile (density, 0.786 g ml
–1
) was continuously added to the aqueous solution to control the density of the mixed solution. The equilibrium density was determined as the density of the external solution at which the nanocomposites sink.

The facile water supply to the elastomer–hydrogel composite without silica aerogel was evaluated by the evaporated amount of water covered with the composite. The evaporated amount was measured by the weight change in the remaining water in the vial for 36 h in the oven. The evaporated amount in an open state and closed state was used as the positive control and negative control, respectively.

Catalyst leaching was calculated by measuring the Pt concentration in the solution, in which the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite and the PAM composite were contained for 14 days. The Pt concentration was detected using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICPS-8100).

The swelling ratio was calculated according to the following equation:
\({{{\mathrm{Swelling}}}}\,{{{\mathrm{ratio}}}}\left( {{{{Q}}}} \right) = \frac{{W_{\mathrm{fs}}}}{{W_{\mathrm{fd}}}}\)
, where
W
fs
and
W
fd
denote the mass of the fully swollen hydrogel sample and mass of the fully dried hydrogel sample, respectively.

The tensile test was conducted to measure the elastic modulus of the bilayer HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite and the PAM composite with a universal testing machine (1 kN load cell, Instron 5543) at the speed of 2.10 mm s
–1
by following a modified version of ISO 527. A bilayer HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite sample with a width of 7 mm, length of 3 mm and thickness of 4 mm was used for the tensile test. The PAM composite sample of the same size was attached to the PET substrate and used for the tensile test.

Thermal imaging was conducted to measure the surface temperature of the nanocomposites with an infrared camera (685-FLIR-I5, FLIR).
Photocatalytic measurements
General procedure for photocatalytic HER measurements
The photocatalytic HER was conducted in a gas-closed quartz cell reactor. The photocatalytic elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite was floated on the 20% methanol aqueous solution. The closed reaction system was purged with Ar gas for 20 min, and the sample was irradiated with a xenon lamp (MAX-302, Ashai Spectra). Light irradiated on top of the sample with a square-shaped projection (2.6 cm

) using a light-guide cable. The light intensity was measured using a detector equipped with a thermophile sensor (919P-003-10, Newport) and fixed at 122 mW cm
–2
. The reaction temperature was maintained at around room temperature using a cooling fan. H

generation was quantified using GC (iGC7200A, DS Science) with a thermal conductivity detector. All the other measurement conditions are identical for the sunken Pt/TiO

cryoaerogel and sunken elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite, except that those samples were placed inside the solution.
Photocatalytic HER measurements with two commercial dyes
Approximately 10 mg of Sudan I dye and 5 mg of Trypan blue dye were added to 20% methanol aqueous solution and sonicated for 1 min for each reaction. All the other measurement conditions are the same as the general photocatalytic HER measurements.
Photocatalytic HER measurements with seawater
All the other measurement conditions are the same as the general photocatalytic HER measurements, but deionized water was replaced by the same volume of seawater.
Photocatalytic HER measurements during photoreforming of PET
Pretreatment of PET substrates was performed by soaking the PET in 1 M KOH solution (5 g l
–1
) for seven days at room temperature with stirring at 300 rpm. All the other measurement conditions are the same as the general photocatalytic HER measurement conditions, but the same volume of solubilized PET in 1 M KOH solution was used instead of methanol aqueous solution.
Photocatalytic HER measurements of the nanocomposites with dimensions of 11.5 × 11.5 cm

The photocatalytic hydrogel nanocomposite was floated on the 20% methanol aqueous solution inside a quartz cell reactor with dimensions of 14.5 × 14.5 × 5 cm

. After complete sealing, the closed reaction system was purged with Ar gas for 1 h, and the sample was irradiated with a solar simulator (ASTM E 927-05, Newport). Then, 100 mW cm
–2
of simulated solar light (AM 1.5G) with square-shaped projection (8.5 × 8.5 cm

) was irradiated on the photocatalytic nanocomposite. The amount of produced H

was measured using a GC system (iGC7200A, DS Science) with a thermal conductivity detector. The gas extracted from the reaction cell was manually injected into the GC once every hour using a syringe.
Photocatalytic HER measurements of the nanocomposites in an area of 1 m

Sixteen elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposites (25 × 25 cm

) with Cu-SA/TiO

NPs embedded were floated on a 20% methanol aqueous solution inside a 113 × 113 × 7 cm

steel cell reactor. Four quartz windows (51 × 51 cm

) were attached to the steel cell. After complete sealing, the closed reaction system was purged with N

gas for 6 h, and the samples were irradiated with natural sunlight. Solar light intensity was measured using an energy meter (Nova II, Ophir). The amount of produced H

was measured using a GC system (iGC7200A, DS Science) with a thermal conductivity detector.
Numerical simulation
Simulation domain
Extended Data 
shows a schematic of the simulation domain. We constructed a two-dimensional simulation domain with the same length scale as in the experiment. H

generation was set as a constant flux of 0.04 mmol h
–1
, in the hydrogel region represented by the red box. In the water region represented by the purple colour, only water exists at first, and H

generated in the hydrogel region diffuses to the water region. In the air region above the water region, only air exists at first, and H

diffuses to this region. The red dotted line indicates the outlet of the domain, and the open-boundary condition is assigned. We measure distance
d
H
from the bottom to the hydrogel region in the experimental system and apply it to the simulation. Here
d
H
is 1.9 cm in the floatable bilayer system and 0 cm in the sunken bilayer system.
Governing equations
In this study, we describe the diffusion process of H

from the hydrogel into water and air. In addition, we consider the reverse reaction of the H

formation reaction, which occurs in water. Both diffusion and reverse reactions of H

are included in the two-dimensional conservation equation as follows:
$$\frac{{\partial c}}{{\partial t}} = D\nabla ^2c + R,$$

where
c
is the H

concentration,
t
is time and
D
is the diffusion coefficient of H

. We set the diffusion coefficient of H

as 5 × 10
−5
cm

s
–1
in water

and 0.7 cm

s
–1
in air

,

. Here
R
indicates the reverse reaction rate of H

, and we assume the reverse reaction rate is proportional to H

concentration, namely,
R
= –
k
r
c
, instead of considering the complex mechanism of the reverse reaction. Here
k
r
, the rate constant of the reverse reaction, is fixed at 1 × 10
−7
s
–1
. The simulation confirmed that the reverse reaction occurred in 1% of the H

concentration under the
R
and
k
r
values used in our study. On the other hand, the reverse reaction does not occur in air; therefore,
R
= 0 in air. The two boundary conditions—H

generation in the hydrogel region and the open-boundary condition—are expressed as follows:
$$\frac{{\partial c}}{{\partial t}} = D\nabla ^2c + R_{\mathrm{gen}},\,R_{\mathrm{gen}} = 0.04\,{\mathrm{mmol}}\,{\mathrm{h}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{in}}\,{\mathrm{the}}\,{\mathrm{hydrogel}}\,{\mathrm{region}},$$

$${{{\mathbf{n}}}} \cdot D\nabla c = 0\,{\mathrm{at}}\,{\mathrm{the}}\,{\mathrm{boundary}}\,{\mathrm{of}}\,{\mathrm{interest}}.$$

In Equation (

),
n
indicates the unit outward normal vector at the boundary of interest. The simulation domain is discretized into ~6,000 elements for lab scale, ~100,000 elements for 1 m scale and ~4,000,000 elements for 10-m scale using commercial COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4 software. In addition, the conservation equation is numerically solved based on the finite element method solver in COMSOL. A workstation with two octa-core processors (Intel Xeon E5-2687W CPUs at 3.1 GHz) and 192 GB of memory is used for the numerical calculation.
Fabrication of floatable photocatalytic nanocomposites in a scalable size
To fabricate the photocatalytic layer, 16 ml of the HPU solution (HPU in water, 50.0 wt%) was prepared and EtOH was added to set the concentration of HPU to 10.5 wt%. NaCl was added to the HPU solution (concentration of NaCl, 0.032 g ml
–1
), and 230 mg Pt/TiO

cryoaerogel was added to the solution. After vigorous stirring, PPG was added to the HPU solution with a volume ratio of 1:2 (PPG:HPU). A mixed sol–gel state was formed after the addition of PPG, and the gel phase was separated after 1 day. After being moulded into an 11.5 × 11.5 cm

square, the gel phase was dried at 60 °C for 2 days to remove EtOH and water, and reswollen in water to remove the NaCl granules in the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite. The separated gel phase (photocatalytic layer) was fully swollen in water, and hydrophobic silica aerogel was added to the top surface of the photocatalytic layer. The fabrication of a supporting layer follows the same procedures, except starting with 90 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50 wt%) and skipping the addition of Pt/TiO

cryoaerogel. The bilayer system of the nanocomposite was fabricated by integrating the photocatalytic layer and supporting layer with the aid of EtOH. EtOH was added dropwise on the top surface of a supporting layer, and a photocatalytic layer was attached to the supporting layer. The bilayer system was dried at 60 °C for 1 day to remove EtOH and reswollen in water.
Fabrication of arrayed nanocomposites in an area of 1 m

The nanocomposites in an area of 1 m

were fabricated by arraying 16 units of bilayer systems with dimensions of 25 × 25 cm

. To fabricate the photocatalytic layer of a single unit, 90 ml of the HPU solution (HPU in water, 50.0 wt%) was prepared and EtOH was added to set the concentration of HPU as 10.5 wt%. NaCl was added to the HPU solution (concentration of NaCl, 0.032 g ml
–1
), and 90 mg of Cu-SA/TiO

NPs was added to the solution. After vigorous stirring, PPG was added to the HPU solution with a volume ratio of 1:2 (PPG:HPU). A mixed sol–gel state was formed after the addition of PPG, and the gel phase was separated after 1 day. After being moulded into a 25 × 25 cm

square, the gel phase was dried at 60 °C for 2 days to remove EtOH and water, and reswollen in water to remove NaCl granules in the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite. The separated gel phase (photocatalytic layer) was fully swollen in water, and hydrophobic silica aerogel was added to the top surface of the photocatalytic layer. The fabrication of a supporting layer of a single unit follows the same procedures, except starting with 350 ml of the HPU solution (HPU in water, 50 wt%) and skipping the addition of Cu-SA/TiO

NPs. The bilayer system of the nanocomposite was fabricated by integrating the photocatalytic layer and supporting layer with the aid of EtOH. EtOH was added dropwise on the top surface of a supporting layer, and a photocatalytic layer was attached to the supporting layer. The bilayer system was dried at 60 °C for 1 day to remove EtOH and reswollen in water.
