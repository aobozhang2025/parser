Methods
DFT calculations
Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using VASP (
). Exchange and correlation effects were approximated with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation energy functional

and the core electrons were calculated using the projector augmented wavefunction. For the W
x
O
y
cluster/Pt, we put a W

O
x
cluster on Pt slabs of 4 layers. In order to eliminate periodic image interactions, we used a big Pt slab (5 × 4) to support one trimer. For the (WO

)
n
monolayer/Pt , we used a (4 × 2) Pt slab to support the (WO

)

2D monolayer structure 
). For each calculation, the bottom two layers of the Pt slab were fixed at the bulk position while the top two layers with the supported oxide cluster and adsorbates were fully relaxed. We applied a Monkhorst–Pack mesh

. The
k
-points were (3 × 2 × 1) and (2 × 4 × 1) for the 5 × 4 slabs and the monolayer supercells, respectively. Transition state searches were carried out using the climbing-image VTST NEB method

. For geometry optimization calculations, the cut-off energy was set to 520 eV and the energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10
−5
eV and 0.01 eV Å
−1
, respectively. In the NEB calculations, the force criterion was set to 0.025 eV Å
−1
. We used pMuTT (
), together with the DFT-calculated reaction energies and vibrational frequencies, to simulate a phase diagram.
Simulated phase diagrams
Thermodynamic phase diagrams were generated using the PhaseDiagram function in pMuTT (
). DFT reaction energies and frequencies were used to calculate Gibbs free energies. The cluster model we used has a formula of W

State-based MKM

was performed using the CHEMKIN package. A batch reactor was chosen to study the reduction kinetics of WO
x
/Pt using H

/H

O mixed gas at different temperatures. Two sites were considered in this model: the Pt site and the WO
x
site. The Pt site is responsible for H

activation, while the tungsten oxides can be hydrogenated and hydrated to generate hydroxyl groups. H-spillover from Pt to WO
x
sites can also reduce the oxide by forming H

O. Due to the huge set of structures of all possible hydrogenated/hydrated tungsten oxides, we did not calculate all activation energies in the reaction network using DFT. Instead, we estimated them using Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationships developed herein from a smaller subset of DFT calculations (Supplementary 
). To keep the chemical potential of H

and H

O constant during the reaction, we chose a small surface area to volume ratio of 10
−20
cm
−1
for the batch reactor. For the calculations starting with fully oxidized W

O

clusters, the reaction time for every condition in MKM was set to 36,000 s. For the re-oxidation of W

O

clusters, the MKM reaction times were set to 10

s. The Brønsted acid density heatmaps were generated by calculating the OH group coverages at each reaction condition at long times. The heatmaps were smoothed by interpolation.
XANES simulation
XANES simulation of W atoms was carried out using FDMNES (refs.

,

), where the convoluted L

edge spectra of all W atoms in each supercell were calculated using the muffin-tin approximation with a radius of 4.0 Å. To account for broadening effects (for example, core–hole lifetime), a Lorentzian energy-dependent convolution was applied to the calculated spectrum. The energy range was set to −20 to 80 eV relative to the Fermi level. The simulated spectra were aligned with the experimental spectra of W standards (WO

and WO

) using the first inflection point.

Catalyst synthesis
The 4 wt% Pt/C catalyst was prepared by the conventional incipient wetness impregnation method, as described previously

,

. First, 0.08 g Pt precursor (Pt(NH

)

(NO

, 99.99%, Alfa Aesar) was dissolved in an 8 g water/ethanol (mass ratio = 3:1) solution. Then, 0.96 g carbon black (225 m

g

, Vulcan XC-72R) was added to the solution and it was kept at room temperature for 12 h. After drying the catalyst in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h, the resulting powder was reduced in a 7-mm-inner diameter quartz tube with 60 ml min

The WO

overlayer was prepared by ALD using a home-built, static system, as described previously

,

,

. In a typical experiment, the tungsten precursor (W(CO)

, 99%, Strem) was first evacuated and then heated to 130 °C. The W(CO)

vapour was then introduced to approximately 0.3 g catalyst, which was evacuated and held at 200 °C before the deposition, for 1.5 min. Next, the catalyst chamber was evacuated for 5 min to remove excess precursors. The catalyst was then exposed to air for 6 min to oxidize the adsorbed W(CO)

precursor. After completing all ALD cycles, the catalyst was treated twice by rapid thermal annealing (400 °C, 1 min) to ensure the complete removal of ligands. Samples prepared using

R except that the carbon black was impregnated with water/ethanol solution without the addition of Pt precursor. The carbon black samples, used as the reference for reaction and characterization, were prepared similarly by impregnation without salts, reduction and finally rapid thermal annealing. The actual Pt and W loadings were determined using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (PerkinElmer, Optima 5300V) by Galbraith Laboratories.
Kinetics experiments
Kinetics experiments were performed using a fixed-bed reactor at near ambient pressure. The reactor was a quartz tube placed in the middle of a resistance furnace. For a typical experiment, the catalyst bed was fixed between two inert quartz beds. The catalyst bed was placed in the constant temperature zone of the furnace to minimize the axial temperature gradient. The temperature of the catalyst bed was measured using a thermocouple covered by a quartz sleeve. Three mass flow controllers were used to feed a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen and helium at specified ratios. The typical flow rate of the gas mixture was 100 ml min
−1
at room temperature.
The alcohol flow rate was adjusted by controlling the temperature of the bubbler and the flow rates of the carrier gas (nitrogen, 99.999% purity) and the balance gas (helium, 99.999% purity). All the pipelines containing alcohol and water were heated to above 150 °C to avoid condensation. The reactor outlet was connected to a gas chromatograph (Agilent, 7890A) equipped with a Plot-Q column and a flame ionization detector. For a typical experiment, the catalyst was pre-reduced with a 100 ml min

H

–He mixture (10% H

) at 250 °C for 1 h with a ramping rate of 10 °C min
−1
. The reactor was then purged with He for 1 h before the reaction.
In situ XAS
XAS measurements were performed on beamline 5BM-D at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Spectra collected in transmission mode were recorded using ionization chambers. Samples were pressed into pellets and loaded into a three-well sample holder. The sample holder was then placed in a tubular reactor with two Kapton windows at the ends for in situ reduction studies. After purging the reactor with a flowing hydrogen–helium mixture (10% hydrogen) and acquiring the spectra of the fresh samples, the reactor was heated to the desired reduction temperature. The XAS spectra of the reduced samples were collected in situ at the desired reduction temperatures under a flowing hydrogen–helium mixture after 1 h reduction. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were recorded at the W L

edge, W L

edge and Pt L

edge and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were recorded at the W L

edge. The XAS spectra of PtWO
x
/C-1R were also collected before and after reduction at 250 °C in fluorescence mode. The measurements were performed using a Linkam cell and a Vortex-ME4 silicon drift detector. The time-dependent XANES spectra for PtWO
x
/C-1R at W L

and W L

edges were recorded on the Quick X-ray Absorption and Scattering (QAS) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) II, Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Fluorescence spectra were measured using a passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector. The spectra of reference foils were measured using ionization chambers. XAS data processing was performed using the Athena (0.9.26) program following standard procedures

. The first maximum of the first derivative of the raw XAS data was selected to be the edge energy.
In situ XPS
The near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) experiments were performed at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Catalyst samples were scanned with a laboratory-based spectrometer (Phoibos NAP 150, SPECS Surface Nano Analysis). The instrument was equipped with a monochromated Al Kα (1,486.6 eV) photon source and a differentially pumped hemispherical analyser (SPECS Phoibos). Each powder sample was pressed to a cleaned thin Cu foil and transferred into the main chamber. Pt 4

spectra were collected during all procedures. Each sample was heated to 250 °C under reduced pressure for 1 h to remove adsorbed surface species. During in situ reduction and the following oxidation studies, hydrogen or oxygen were introduced into the main chamber through a variable leak valve. The pressure of the main chamber was maintained at 0.5 mbar. XPS data analysis was performed using CasaXPS version 2.3.23. The peak model parameters are shown in Supplementary 
.
Brønsted acid site quantification
The Brønsted acid site density of PtWO
x
/C-1R was measured under different gaseous environments using reactive gas chromatography

, equipped with H

or He to simulate reducing or annealing treatment environments, respectively. Initially, 20 mg of catalyst was sandwiched between two plugs of deactivated glass wool (Restek, 24324) and placed within a quartz inlet liner (Agilent, 5062-3587). The catalyst-containing liner was placed in the inlet of a gas chromatograph (Agilent, 7890B) equipped with an HP-PlotQ column (Agilent, 19091P-Q04) and a flame ionization detector. Unless otherwise noted, the catalyst was pre-treated in situ at 400 °C under a flow of H

, pure He or 10% H

O/He mixture to reduce, anneal or steam the catalyst, respectively. The pre-treated catalyst was then saturated at 140 °C with 10 consecutive 1 µl pulses of
tert
-butylamine, delivered at a rate of 1 µl min
−1
using an automated liquid sampler. The saturated catalyst was then purged in 1,000 sccm of He to remove any weakly bound
tert
-butylamine. The catalyst temperature was then ramped up to 400 °C at 10 °C min
−1
and held for 30 min, with the chromatography column held at 30 °C to trap desorbing butenes resulting from the Hofmann elimination of
tert
-butylamine adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites. The temperature of the chromatography column was then ramped to 270 °C eluting any trapped isobutene which was then quantified and taken as a direct measure of the Brønsted acid site density.
