O

ratios of 25, 38, 50 and 85 were obtained from Nankai University Catalyst Company and Zeolyst International. CuZSM SA was prepared by an ion exchange method

. Typically, 1 g of ZSM-5 was dispersed in 50 ml of ethanol by magnetic stirring. Subsequently, 10 mg of CuSO

After vigorous stirring for 12 h, CuZSM SA was successfully obtained. The obtained products were thoroughly washed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by centrifugation. Subsequently, they were dried in an oven at 60 °C to remove any residual solvents, resulting in the final CuZSM SA product. The dried product was meticulously ground into a fine powder for further use. Subsequently, the porcelain boat-containing CuZSM SA was gradually heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min

Synthesis of Cu NPs-5 nm, Cu NPs-20 nm and Cu NPs-100 nm
In a typical preparation of Cu NPs-5 nm, 13.3 mg Cu(acac)

(Sigma-Aldrich), 27 mg ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 ml oleylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 ml oleic acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) were mixed and ultrasonicated for approximately 0.5 h in a sealed vial (30 ml). Then, the vial was transferred into an oil bath and heated at 180 °C for 3 h (
). The resulting colloidal products in the vial were collected by centrifugation and then washed with an ethanol/cyclohexane mixture to obtain Cu NPs-5 nm. The preparations of Cu NPs-20 nm and Cu NPs-100 nm were similar to that of Cu NPs-5 nm but without adding oleic acid and ascorbic acid, respectively.
Characterizations
XRD patterns were collected by a SmartLab-SE powder diffractometer operating with Cu Kα radiation (
λ
= 0.15406 nm). TEM was measured on a JEM-1400 TEM at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. SEM-EDS was obtained through a ZEISS Sigma 300 field emission scanning electron microscope. In addition, AC-HAADF-STEM was captured using a JEOL GrandARM300F with double Cs correctors at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. XPS measurements were performed on an ESCALAB 250 XI X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha with Al Kα radiation. The C 1
s
peak at 284.8 eV was used as a calibration standard. XAS spectra were acquired at the TLS 01C1 beamline of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC).
CORR test in flow cell
The CORR test was carried out in a flow cell that consisted of two electrolyte chambers (20 × 5 × 3 mm) and one gas chamber (20 × 5 × 5 mm). A Fumasep FAA-3-PK-130 anion exchange membrane was used as a separator. A catalyst-deposited gas diffusion electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode in 4.0 M KCl solution and a platinum sheet with a thickness of 0.5 mm were utilized as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. To fabricate the working electrode, 4.5 mg catalyst was dispersed in 1 ml of cyclohexane with 20 µl of 5 wt% Nafion solution (Dupont, D-520), and then the solution was sprayed onto the surface of the gas diffusion layer (Sinero, YLS-30T). The working electrode was placed between gas and catholyte chambers to ensure CO diffusion and reaction at the catholyte/catalyst interface. The reference electrodes were inserted in the catholyte chamber and maintained at a specified distance with the working electrode. An electrochemical workstation (CHI660, Chenhua, Shanghai) with a current amplifier was used to perform the CORR test. KOH (1 M) was circulated through the electrolyte chambers under constant flow (20 ml min
−

) via a peristaltic pump. CO was supplied into gas chambers by a mass-flow controller at a constant flow rate of 30 ml min
−

. The CORR was tested via chronopotentiometry at differing currents for 0.5 h without iR correction. Gas and liquid products were analysed via GC (Techcomp, GC7980) and

H NMR (Bruker AVANCE III HD 500 MHz), respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (350 mV overpotential) test was conducted from 1 Hz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV.
Electrode potentials were rescaled to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) reference by
$${E}_{\text{RHE}}={E}_{\text{vs Ag}/\text{AgCl}}+0.059\times \text{pH}+0.21$$

The FE for the formation of CORR products was computed by the following equation:
$${\mathrm{FE}}={nZF}/Q={nZF}/(I\times t)$$

The formation rate (
R
) of each species was calculated using the following equation:
$$R=(Q\times {\mathrm{FE}})/(96485\times Z\times t\times S)$$

CORR test in MEA
To prepare the cathode catalyst ink, 10 mg of catalysts was mixed with 1 ml of ethanol and 20 μl of a Nafion solution, followed by ultrasonic treatment for 1 h. CuZSM SACL was carefully sprayed onto the surface of carbon paper to prepare the cathode electrode with a catalyst loading of 1.5 mg cm
−

, and an Ni–Fe/Ni foam was used as the anode electrode

. Subsequently, the cathode and anode electrodes were placed with a home-made poly(aryl-co-aryl piperidinium) anion exchange membrane to fabricate a CuZSM SACL-based MEA. Then, the MEA was assembled with two gaskets and two titanium backplates using a torque wrench to fabricate the cathode-dried CORR electrolyser, and KOH solution was fed in the anode only. The effects of catalyst loading, KOH concentration, liquid flow rate and ionomer content on the CORR performance of the CuZSM SACL-based MEA electrolyser under atmospheric pressure conditions were systematically investigated before recording current–voltage (

) curves. The measurement and analysis methods used in this study are in alignment with those utilized in the flow cell set-up.
In situ XAS measurement
In situ XAS measurements (XANES and EXAFS) of Cu K-edge were performed in fluorescence mode at the beamline BL14W1 of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The XAS was measured using a custom-made electrochemical flow cell. A CuZSM SACL-coated carbon paper, an Ag/AgCl electrode (4.0 M KCl) and a platinum wire were utilized as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The electrochemical measurements were performed in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The XAS measurements were conducted at −0.9 V versus RHE, and the XAS spectra were collected at an angle of 45° with respect to the detector and beamline. The acquired XANES and EXAFS data were processed using the Athena programme.
In situ ATR-FTIR measurement
Electrochemical in situ ATR-FTIR was utilized to track the signals of the intermediates using Nicolet Nexus 6700 spectroscopy equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. The set-up included an ECIR-II cell, supplied by Shanghai Linglu Instrument & Equipment, which featured a Pike Veemax III ATR in a three-electrode configuration. To enhance signal intensity, the monocrystalline silicon surface was initially coated with a layer of gold using the chemical plating technique. Subsequently, 20 μl of catalyst ink was dispensed onto the gold-coated surface, serving as the working electrode. A platinum sheet served as the counter electrode, while an Ag/AgCl electrode acted as the reference electrode. Before initiating the test, the electrolyte was purged with CO feeding gas for 30 min and maintained with continuous bubbling throughout the entire measurement process. Before initiating the test, the potential-dependent in situ ATR-FTIR tests were carried out with the linear sweep voltammetry test from −0.3 V to −1.0 V (versus RHE) with a scan rate of 5 mV s

. The valence electrons were considered using a plane wave basis set with an energy cut-off of 520 eV, which ensured accurate total energy calculations. The exchange-correlation energy of the interacting electrons was determined using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functionals within the generalized gradient approximation

In the computational hydrogen electrode model, at 0 V (versus RHE), the chemical potential of a proton–electron pair,
μ
(H

) +
μ
(e
−
), is equal to half of the chemical potential of the gas-phase hydrogen molecule, 1/2
μ
(H

(g)), at 101,325 Pa, at all pH values and at all temperatures. Consequently, the chemical potential of the proton–electron pair can be adjusted as a function of applied potential by the standard relation between chemical and electrical potentials, Δ
μ
= −
eU
. Thus, the total value of
μ
(H

) +
μ
(e

) as a function of applied potential at all temperatures and pH values can be expressed as follows:
$${\rm{\mu }}\left({\text{H}}^{+}\right)+{\rm{\mu }}\left({\text{e}}^{-}\right)=\frac{1}{2}{\rm{\mu }}({\text{H}}_{2}(\text{g}))-{eU}$$

The free energy change for each intermediate step that involves a proton–electron pair transfer will be a function of
U
. Compared with zero applied potential, the free energies of the adsorbates with
n
pairs of electron–proton, referenced to H

O (g), will decrease by
