Supplementary | Catalyst synthesis via one-step annealing. a, b, TEM images (a) and
XRD patterns (b) of Ni/NC catalysts with different metal loadings prepared by impregnation
of NiCl followed by conventional one-step annealing. The formation of large Ni nanoparticles

is readily detected at a metal loading of 2 wt.%, and the particle size gradually increases with
higher Ni content. Reflections corresponding to the metallic phase are evident in samples
containing 5 and 10 wt.% Ni, and the absence thereof in 2 wt.% Ni/NC suggests that the
crystallite sizes are below the detection limit.

Supplementary | Characterization of catalyst carriers. Representative low-
magnification TEM images of metal-free NC (a), PCN (e) and CeO (i). High-resolution TEM

images of NC (b), PCN (f) and CeO (j). XRD patterns of NC (c), PCN (g) and CeO (k). N

isotherms of NC (d), PCN (h) and CeO (l). The corresponding derived total surface areas were

1724, 172 and 82 m2 g−1, respectively.

Supplementary | Surface concentration of metal atoms in UHD-SACs based on NC,
PCN, and CeO carriers. The surface concentration was estimated based on the bulk metal

content and the specific surface area of the carrier, assuming that all of the metal remains on
the carrier surface. Although wet deposition approaches are known to promote surface
localization, for certain first row transition metals it may not be the case. For example, Cu and
Fe were predicted to percolate preferentially into the bulk of graphitic carbon nitride (ACS
Catal. 10, 11069 ), which might explain the significantly higher values observed for
PCN compared to NC and CeO .

Supplementary | XANES, EXAFS and STEM characterization of Pt /TiO and
1 2
Pt /Al O UHD-SACs. The Pt L -edge a, XANES and b, Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra
1 2 3 3
of Pt /TiO and Pt /Al O are compared with Pt references (Pt foil and PtO ). The intensities
1 2 1 2 3 2
of the white line of Pt /TiO and Pt /Al O are close to PtO , suggesting that the Pt atoms are
1 2 1 2 3 2
positively charged. Besides, the Fourier transformed EXAFS magnitude of Pt /TiO and
1 2
Pt /Al O are characterized by a single significant peak around 1.63 Å that is close to the
1 2 3
location of the Pt-O peak in the PtO reference and thus can be ascribed to Pt-O bonding. The

absence of a Pt-Pt peak confirms that Pt species are atomically dispersed on TiO and Al O .

The Pt contents are 8.3 wt.% and 6.8 wt.% for TiO and Al O , respectively. c, Atomic-

Supplementary | XRD and TEM characterization of Pt/SiO . a, XRD patterns of

Pt/SiO after low-temperature (-LT, 200 °C) and high temperature (-HT, 400 °C) annealing. b,

Dark-field TEM image of Pt/SiO -HT. Although surface hydroxyl groups present on silica

carriers can act as acids/bases, they are known to be inert and irreducible up to high
temperatures. Consistently, Pt single atoms cannot be isolated on amorphous silica with the
presented method. Due to the weak bond between surface oxygen and Pt, the atomic dispersion
can only be retained up to 200 °C (Pt/SiO -LT), above which aggregates are formed (Pt/SiO -
2 2
HT).

metals for multimetallic UHD-SACs shaded orange. STEM image (b), the corresponding EDS
spectra (c) of Ni, Pd and Pt in Ni Pd Pt /NC. Scale bar: 100 nm. d, XRD patterns of Ni Pd /NC

and Ni Pd Pt /NC only show the broad reflection at 20-30° and 40-50° belonging to amorphous
1 1 1
carbon, no metal-related features can be observed. The Ni and Pd loadings are measured to be
4.2 and 8.6 wt.%, respectively, for Ni Pd /NC sample. The Ni, Pd and Pt loadings for
1 1
Ni Pd Pt /NC sample were determined as 2.3, 5.1 and 9.8 wt.%, respectively.

atom catalysts only exhibit reflections from the supports, no metal-related signatures can be
observed. Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra of UHD-SACs of various metals on NC (d),
PCN (e) and CeO (f). The Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra of all single-atom catalysts

show the main peak below 2 Å, which can be ascribed to the metal-N/O bonding. No metal-
metal bond is detected in any of the samples, confirming the metals are atomically dispersed
on the supports.

Supplementary | a, DFT calculated energy pathway for the formation of Ni /NC from

the NiSO precursor with representative transition states and intermediates depicted inset. Ni

K-edge b, XANES spectra and c, Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra of NiSO /NC and

Ni /NC. A stepwise removal of the sulphate anion similar to NiCl is evidenced. Ni K-edge
1 2
XANES and Fourier-transformed EXAFS also confirms the presence of the anion in a
NiSO /NC intermediate with broken D symmetry, higher valence state and a longer Ni-N
4 4h
bonding length, than the final Ni /NC-state. Following the DFT results (a), in the first step the

anchoring of a single NiSO entity to the N4 site in the carrier surmounts a barrier of 1.03 eV.

The rotation and abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the carrier (barrier 2.05 eV) is driven by
the release of a H SO molecule.

Supplementary | DFT analysis of the reaction network. DFT calculated binding
energy of intermediates on catalysts for the CO reduction (CO2RR) and hydrogen evolution

(HER) reactions. A key issue for the electrocatalytic CO RR to CO is the rate of the competing

HER, where H+ does not attach to the CO but adsorbs on the catalytic site and then forms a

H molecule. Thus, the decisive factor in the selective reduction of CO is the competition
2 2
between the free energies of *COOH (G ) and *H (G ) intermediates on each reaction.
*COOH *H
Our calculations show that G (1.57 eV) is lower than G (1.67 eV). As a result, CO RR
*COOH *H 2
has lower activation energy than HER, consistent with the high CO RR performance observed

experimentally.

a T is selected to be close to the temperature of decomposition of the Ni precursor. If T is
1 1
selected to be higher than the temperature of decomposition, then nanoparticle formation is
observed. If T is much lower than the decomposition temperature this leads to lower metal

contents in the resulting SACs.
