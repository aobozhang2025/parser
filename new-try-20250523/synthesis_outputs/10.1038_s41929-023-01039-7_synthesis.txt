Catalyst synthesis
Fe
0.5
NC catalyst was prepared from Fe
II
acetate (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen; ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Zn
II
zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8, Basolite Z1200, BASF). One gram of the precursor mixture containing 0.5 wt% Fe and a mass ratio of phen/ZIF-8 of 20/80 were mixed using dry ball-milling for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm. A ZrO

crucible with 100 ZrO

balls of 5 mm diameter was used in this procedure. The resulting precursors were pyrolysed at 1,323 K under Ar flow for 1 h. Fe
0.5
NC contained Fe content of ca. 1.5 wt%, as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES). For the synthesis of Fe
0.5
NC–Pt, 0.5 wt% Pt was impregnated on Fe
0.5
NC by conventional wet impregnation and subsequent H

reduction. 0.1 g Fe
0.5
NC was dissolved and dispersed in 100 ml of de-ionized water containing 1.3 mg of H

PtCl

·6H

O (≥37.5%, Pt basis, Merck), and then the solvent was evaporated at 353 K. The resultant powder sample was dried at 353 K under vacuum overnight and reduced at 523 K for 3 h under H

flow (5%, 200 ml min
−1
). Commercial Pt nanoparticle (HiSPEC 3000, 20 wt% Pt) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. For the synthesis of Fe

O

/NC, the NC catalyst was first prepared identically to Fe
0.5
NC, except for the addition of Fe
II
acetate during the ball-milling step. Note that owing to the presence of trace amounts of Fe impurities in the commercial ZIF-8 (>100 ppm) (
), Fe-free ZIF-8 was used for the synthesis of NC, which was prepared by mixing 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Zn nitrate hexahydrate (Zn salt; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) in aqueous solution (Zn salt/2-MeIm/water molar ratio of 1/60/2228) (
). Afterwards, Fe

O

/NC was synthesized by a dry ball-milling of 98 mg NC and 2 mg commercial Fe

O

(96%, Sigma-Aldrich) for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm without heat treatment. The Fe content in Fe

O

/NC was ca. 1.3 wt%, as confirmed by ICP–OES. Commercial Fe–N–C catalyst (no. PMF-0110904, Pajarito Powder) was purchased from Pajarito Powder Inc, which is synthesized via hard templating with fumed silica. The carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported Fe-N-C catalyst (FeNC/CNT) was synthesized using a silica-protective-layer-assisted approach

. Then 100 mg of nitric acid-treated CNTs (Carbon Nanomaterial Technology) were mixed with 200 mg of Fe
III
TMPPCl (Porphyrin Systems) in an agate mortar for 5 min. The mixture was heated in a quartz-tube furnace, starting from room temperature to 673 K, at a ramping rate of 275 K min
−1
and kept at that temperature for 3 h under N

gas (99.999%) flowing at a rate of 1 l min
−1
. Afterwards, the heat-treated CNT/Fe
III
TMPPCl composite was mixed with 0.5 ml of TEOS in a mortar, followed by mixing with 0.5 ml of formic acid. The resulting mixture was transferred to an alumina crucible and dried in a 333 K oven for 3 h. Subsequently, the composite was heated to 1,073 K at a ramping rate of 275 K min
−1
and maintained at that temperature for 3 h under N

gas flowing at a rate of 1 l min
−1
. To etch the silica, the resulting composite was mixed with 2:1 (v/v) solution of ethanol and 10% aqueous HF, and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was then filtered and washed with ethanol multiple times. The HF etching process was repeated following the same procedure, and the resulting sample was dried at 333 K to obtain FeNC/CNT samples.
Physicochemical characterization
XRD patterns were obtained using a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer (X’Pert PRO MPD, PANalytical) equipped with a Cu
K
α
X-ray source. The XRD patterns were measured at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV and current of 55 mA, with scan rate of 10° min
−1
and step size of 0.02°. Raman spectra were obtained using a NRS-5000 series Raman spectrometer (JASCO) with 633 nm laser excitation. XPS measurements were performed using
K
-Alpha
+
(Thermo Scientific) instrument equipped with a micro-focused monochromator X-ray source. The binding energy used for the peak deconvolution of the XPS-Pt spectra (for 4f
7/2
) was 72.4 and 73.8 eV for Pt
II
and Pt
IV
, respectively, and the spin-orbit splitting for 4f
5/2
and 4f
7/2
peaks was 3.33 eV (
). ICP–OES analysis was performed using Optima 4300 DV (PerkinElmer) for determining Fe contents. Fe K-edge or Pt L

-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) signals were collected in the transmission mode at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (8C, Nano XAFS). To compensate any energy shift during data acquisition, the XAS energy scale was calibrated using each metal foil before the measurements. The XANES and EXAFS analyses were conducted using Athena and Artemis implemented in the Demeter program package. The EXAFS data in
k
space was Fourier-transformed with the Hanning window function (d
k
= 0.5 Å
–1
) after
k

-weighting. Curve fitting of the FT-EXAFS of Fe
0.5
NC–Pt was carried out in the
R
range of 1.1–2.3 Å with phase correction by including Pt–N and Pt–Cl scattering paths. The amplitude reduction factor (
S

) for Pt was determined to be 0.83 from the curve fitting of the EXAFS of the Pt foil. The wavelet transform of
k

-weighted EXAFS data was analysed with phase correction using the HAMA Fortran code. A Morlet function was used for the mother wavelet function (
η
= 10,
σ
= 1). The

Fe Mössbauer spectrum was acquired using a

Co source in Rh. The measurement was performed by keeping both the source and absorber at 7 K. The spectrometer was operated with a triangular velocity waveform, and a NaI scintillation detector was used to detect γ-rays. TEM, energy dispersive spectroscopy and HAADF-STEM analyses were performed using TECNAI G2 F30 S-Twin (FEI), TECNAI F20 UT (FEI) and Titan 80–300 (FEI), respectively.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties were investigated using a VMP-300 potentiostat (Bio-Logic) in a three-electrode cell equipped with a graphite rod counter electrode and saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode (RE-1A, EC-Frontier). A 0.1 M HClO

electrolyte was prepared using ultrapure water (>18 MΩ, Sartorious) and concentrated HClO

(70%, Sigma-Aldrich). The reference electrode was calibrated against a Pt electrode in an H

-saturated electrolyte at various temperatures to convert the potentials to the RHE scale correctly. To prevent any undesirable changes in the equilibrium potential of the reference electrode, we maintained its temperature at room temperature during experiments (Supplementary 
). The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 10 mg of the catalyst in an aqueous solution (868 μl de-ionized water, 7 μl isopropanol and 80 μl 5 wt% Nafion solution). After ultrasonication of the above suspension for 30 min, the working electrodes were prepared by dropping 15 μl of catalyst ink onto a glassy carbon disk (0.196 cm

) of the RDE (01169, ALS). The catalyst loadings were set to 800 μg cm
−2
for Fe
0.5
NC or Fe
0.5
NC–Pt, and 10 μg
Pt
cm
−2
for Pt nanoparticles. The ORR polarization curves were recorded with a scan rate of 10 mV s
−1
and rotation speed of 900 rpm in an O

-saturated 0.1 M HClO

electrolyte. ORR Faradaic currents were obtained by subtracting the polarization curves measured in an Ar-saturated electrolyte. The PRR polarization curves were measured with a scan rate of 1 mV s
−1
and a rotation speed of 900 rpm in an Ar-saturated 0.1 M HClO

electrolyte containing 1.3 mM H

O

. Nitrite stripping experiment was conducted on the Fe
0.5
NC catalysts collected from the Fe
0.5
NC/GDE before and after a 2 h potentiostatic hold at 0.6 V
RHE
and 353 K under Ar flow. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the catalyst in an aqueous solution (267 μl de-ionized water, 25 μl isopropanol and 2 μl 5 wt% Nafion solution). After ultrasonication of the above suspension for 30 min, the working electrodes were prepared by dropping 75 μl of catalyst ink onto a glassy carbon disk (0.196 cm

) of the RDE (01169, ALS). The catalyst loading was set to 50 μg cm
−2
.
Online GDE/EFC/ICP–MS measurements
The GDE was fabricated by spraying catalyst ink onto a mesoporous layer (MPL) deposited on carbon paper. On a carbon paper with a 20 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) content (2 × 2 cm

, TGP-H-090, Toray), highly hydrophobic carbon MPL was first fabricated by spraying an ink emulsion containing 100 mg Ketjen Black EC-300J, 400 mg PTFE (60 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 ml isopropyl alcohol (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), followed by heat treatment at 513 and 613 K under Ar atmosphere for 30 min each. The resulting MPL had a Ketjen Black EC-300J loading of 2 mg cm
−2
. Thereafter, catalyst ink (25 mg catalyst + 10 ml isopropanol + 250 μl 5 wt% Nafion solution) was sprayed onto the MPL to reach target catalyst loadings of 400 μg cm
−2
. The active catalyst area of the GDE was 0.096 cm

. Fe dissolution was monitored using ICP–MS (7500ce, Agilent) coupled with a GDE-based EFC. The EFC is equipped with a U-shaped channel with a diameter of 1 mm and an opening for contact with the GDE. A graphite tube counter electrode (inner diameter 1 mm) was placed at the inlet, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode was connected to the outlet of EFC. A 0.1 M HClO

electrolyte, de-aerated using a degasser (AG-32-01, FLOM Corp.), was flowed into the EFC at a flow rate of 200 μl min
−1
. The electrolyte was mixed with 0.2 M HNO

containing 5 ppb

Re as an internal standard using a Y-connector (mixing ratio 1:1). Ar or O

gases flowed into the graphite serpentine gas channel at a rate of 5 ml min
−1
. GDE was pre-treated with 200 fast CV cycles (200 mV s
−1
) in the potential range of 1.0–0.0 V
RHE
at 298 K before the electrochemical measurement. After stabilization at the desired temperature for ca. 10 min, Fe dissolution was analysed under potentiodynamic or potentiostatic conditions. Fe dissolution under potentiodynamic conditions was analysed with three slow CV cycles (5 mV s
−1
) in the potential range of 1.0–0.0 V
RHE
at various temperatures (298, 313, 333 and 353 K) under Ar or O

flow. Fe dissolution under potentiostatic conditions was analysed by holding 0.4, 0.6 or 0.8 V
RHE
at 353 K under Ar or O

flow. ORR polarization curves were recorded with a scan rate of 5 mV s
−1
at 298 K. A manual
iR
compensation (MIR) program was used to compensate 85% of ohmic drop during the electrochemical measurements and 15% post-corrected. The uncompensated resistance was measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at open circuit potential (Supplementary 
).
Computational details
Spin-polarized DFT calculations were conducted by using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) 5.4.4 (
). The projector-augmented wave pseudopotential and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional were applied for all calculations

,

. For the plane-wave basis, the kinetic energy cut-off was set as 520 eV. The first order of the Methfessel–Paxton method was used with a smearing width of 0.05 eV (
). A (5 × 5 × 1)
\(\Gamma\)
-centred
k
-point grid was used to sample the reciprocal space. The convergence criterion was set as 1 × 10
−5
eV for the electronic step, and 0.01 eV Å
−1
for the ionic relaxation step. Atomic partial charges were calculated using the Bader charge analysis

.
For accurate calculations of the slab geometry, an additional vacuum region was included with a dipole correction to eliminate electrostatic interactions between periodic images along the surface normal direction. The (6 × 6) surface unit cell of graphene served as the base structure for investigating eight different Fe–N

system structures, wherein the locations of the Pt–N

site were varied. Additionally, three additional structures were explored by varying the intersite distance between Fe–N

and Pt–N

, using the base structure of an (8 × 8) surface unit cell of graphene (Supplementary Figs.

and

). For the formation energy calculations, the reference states of H, C, N, Fe and Pt were chosen as H

, graphite, N

, α-phase of Fe solid and face-centred-cubic Pt solid, respectively.
For the calculation of energy profiles concerning the Fe dissolution reaction at electrified (or charged) interfaces, the VASPsol package employing the implicit solvation method was utilized. The Debye length was set at 0.304 nm
−1
, and the dielectric constant was set at 78.4. In our slab model of the Fe–N

system, a surface charge density of 17.50 μC cm
−2
was applied, resulting in an electrochemical potential of 0.40 V
RHE
, which closely corresponds to the experimental conditions. pH 1.0 is assumed to calculate the RHE potential from theoretical SHE potential. To investigate the energetics of non-electrochemical reactions, the system charge was then adjusted on the basis of the charge states of reactants and products; specifically, the system charge was decreased by 2 for the removal of Fe
II
and increased by 1 for each added proton. Three possible reaction paths were investigated; the most plausible reaction mechanism is shown in ,b
, while the others are presented in Supplementary 
. For the most plausible reaction mechanism, the reaction free energies of Fe
II
detachment step at various pH conditions were further calculated (Supplementary 
). The energy state of Fe
II
(aq) was calculated by evaluating the ionization energy of Fe and the solvation-free energy of Fe
II
using Jaguar 10.9 software

(B3LYP functional

with LANL2DZ basis set

) as coupled with the Poisson–Boltzmann implicit solvation model

(Supplementary Note

).
PEMFC operation
MEA was prepared by a catalyst-coated membrane method via spray coating to compare the single-cell performance of Fe
0.5
NC and Fe
0.5
NC-Pt as cathode catalysts with all the Pt/C-based anodes. The cathode slurries were prepared by ultrasonically mixing 50 mg of catalysts (Fe
0.5
NC and Fe
0.5
NC-Pt) in a solution containing 10 ml of isopropanol, and 334 mg of 5 wt% Nafion solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The anode slurries were prepared by ultrasonically mixing 10 mg of catalysts (37.7 wt% Pt/C, TANAKA Precious Metals) in a solution containing 3 ml of isopropanol, and 66.7 mg of the Nafion solution. Each slurry was coated onto a Nafion 211 membrane. The prepared MEA was pressed at 375 lbf and 557 K for 2.5 min. After cooling for 10 min
via
the cooling press, we successfully obtained MEA with an active area of 5.0 cm

. The catalyst contents of the cathode and anode electrodes were controlled at approximately 4.0 and 0.25 mg cm
−2
, respectively. The cell performance of MEA was evaluated using a PEMFC test station (CNL Energy). The single-cell includes the MEA, gas diffusion layers (Sigracet 39BB, SGL Carbon), bipolar plates constituting serpentine channels of graphite, and current collector plates made of gold-coated blocks. Before evaluating the cell performance, a break-in process was conducted in the following steps: H

and O

with 200 and 300 ml min
−1
flow rates with the condition of 100% relative humidity at 353 K were provided for the anode and cathode, respectively. Thereafter, a 0.1 V per step was applied for 30 s in the cycling range of 0.3–0.7 V until the performance of MEA at 0.6 V was stabilized. To evaluate the cell performance, polarization curves were obtained during a potential sweep from 0.94 to 0.2 V with 1 bar of back pressure.
