synthesis of Fe 0.5 NC–Pt, we studied its stability using online GDE/EFC/ICP–MS at 0.6 V RHE and 353 K under O 2 flow. Notably, despite its similar initial ORR activity with Fe 0.5 NC, the Fe 0.5 NC–Pt reveals much better retention of ORR activity during a 2 h potentiostatic hold (−35% and −60% for Fe 0.5 NC–Pt and Fe 0.5 NC, respectively; a ). The GDE/EFC/ICP–MS results measured under Ar flow show ~3 times less Fe leaching from Fe 0.5 NC–Pt than Fe 0.5 NC (that is, 465 and 1,285 μg Fe g catal −1 , respectively; b ), without discernable Pt dissolution (Supplementary ). Unlike Fe 0.5 NC (e ), the lifetime-dependent stability diagram of Fe 0.5 NC–Pt shows a close interrelation of j loss with a decrease in TOF, rather than a decrease in SD (Supplementary ). Thus, these results imply that the enhanced stability of Fe 0.5 NC–Pt may result from the stabilization of Fe–N 4 sites against demetallation as a consequence of the introduction of isolated Pt sites in the carbon matrix. : Proof-of-concept strategy with isolated Pt ion as a stabilizer of Fe–N 4 sites. a , b , ORR current density ( a ) and real-time Fe dissolution under Ar flow ( b ) of Fe 0.5 NC/GDE and Fe 0.5 NC–Pt/GDE obtained by online GDE/EFC/ICP–MS during 2 h potential hold at 0.6 V RHE and 353 K.

For comparison, the initial PRR polarization curve of Pt/C is also shown. Full size image We further found that the enhanced stability, concluded from the GDE/EFC/ICP–MS system, was also transferred to the PEMFC. At the beginning of operation, the Fe 0.5 NC–Pt cathode showed similar PEMFC performance to that of the Fe 0.5 NC cathode. However, PEMFC with Fe 0.5 NC–Pt cathode exhibited much superior stability during 50 h of operation at 0.5 V (c,d ; the cell voltage corresponds to the cathode potential of ~0.6 V RHE considering the anodic overpotential and Ohmic loss in PEMFC 38 ). To identify whether the enhanced stability is attributed to a possible artefact originating from the operando agglomeration of isolated Pt sites into ORR-active particles, the Fe 0.5 NC–Pt cathode was separated from the membrane–electrode assembly (MEA) after the test and post-mortem characterized. In the HAADF-STEM image, no discernible changes were observed in the atomic distribution of the Pt species after 50 h of PEMFC operation (e ). In addition, the FT- and WT-EXAFS plots for the aged Fe 0.5 NC–Pt revealed a dominant Pt–N interaction, without a perceptible signal from Pt–Pt interaction (f and Supplementary ), almost identical to that for the pristine Fe 0.5 NC–Pt. More evidently, the aged Fe 0.5 NC–Pt recorded a PRR onset potential of 0.81 V RHE, which is much lower than that of Pt/C (0.92 V RHE ) and pristine Fe 0.5 NC–Pt and Fe 0.5 NC (0.83 V RHE ), and similar to that of aged Fe 0.5 NC (0.81 V RHE ; g ). The results therefore indicated no formation of highly active Pt nanoclusters and particles during PEMFC operation. In addition, it can be safely ruled out that Pt single atoms could lead to improved stability by acting as peroxide scavengers (Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary ). Therefore, the fundamental origin of the enhanced stability of PEMFC with Fe 0.5 NC–Pt cathode is unveiled as isolated Pt-induced stabilization of catalytic Fe–N 4 sites against demetallation. Finally, even though a noble element Pt is used and the Pt-modified catalyst is not optimized in the present study, this proof-of-concept study validates that various synthetic approaches can be established to avoid Fe demetallation of active Fe–N 4 sites, a critical degradation path dominating a rapid performance drop during the initial PEMFC operation. Conclusions In this work, we quantitatively resolve the two key phenomena behind the rapid performance loss of Fe–N–C cathodes at an early stage of PEMFC operation. A time- and potential-resolved diagnosis, enabled by the online GDE/EFC/ICP–MS system, elucidates the strong dependence of Fe leaching from active Fe–N 4 moieties on operating variables, such as temperature and gas atmosphere. The former triggers Fe dissolution and determines its total amount, whereas the latter yields different fates of dissolved Fe ions. In addition, this operando study further enables differentiation of a real-time modification of SD and TOF values from the apparent ORR activity drop, a lifetime-dependent stability diagram that presents a clear shift of a prime deactivation path from SD loss to TOF decrease under realistic PEMFC operating conditions. Finally, we conclude that Fe demetallation is a crucial phenomenon responsible for the rapid performance drop observed during the first few hours of PEMFC operation. We show that prohibiting undesirable Fe demetallation and consequently enhancing PEMFC stability are synthetically available by introducing site-isolated Pt ions onto the Fe–N–C catalyst, the concept inspired by previous works and our DFT calculations. Therefore, this understanding suggests that the development of synthetic routes involving non-PGM stabilizers of Fe–N 4 sites could bring hope for the future reality of Fe–N–C catalysts for commercial PEMFCs. Methods Catalyst synthesis Fe 0.5 NC catalyst was prepared from Fe II acetate (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen; ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Zn II zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8, Basolite Z1200, BASF). One gram of the precursor mixture containing 0.5 wt% Fe and a mass ratio of phen/ZIF-8 of 20/80 were mixed using dry ball-milling for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm. A ZrO 2 crucible with 100 ZrO 2 balls of 5 mm diameter was used in this procedure. The resulting precursors were pyrolysed at 1,323 K under Ar flow for 1 h. Fe 0.5 NC contained Fe content of ca. 1.5 wt%, as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES). For the synthesis of Fe 0.5 NC–Pt, 0.5 wt% Pt was impregnated on Fe 0.5 NC by conventional wet impregnation and subsequent H 2 reduction. 0.1 g Fe 0.5 NC was dissolved and dispersed in 100 ml of de-ionized water containing 1.3 mg of H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O (≥37.5%, Pt basis, Merck), and then the solvent was evaporated at 353 K. The resultant powder sample was dried at 353 K under vacuum overnight and reduced at 523 K for 3 h under H 2 flow (5%, 200 ml min −1 ). Commercial Pt nanoparticle (HiSPEC 3000, 20 wt% Pt) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. For the synthesis of Fe 2 O 3 /NC, the NC catalyst was first prepared identically to Fe 0.5 NC, except for the addition of Fe II acetate during the ball-milling step. Note that owing to the presence of trace amounts of Fe impurities in the commercial ZIF-8 (>100 ppm) ( ), Fe-free ZIF-8 was used for the synthesis of NC, which was prepared by mixing 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Zn nitrate hexahydrate (Zn salt; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) in aqueous solution (Zn salt/2-MeIm/water molar ratio of 1/60/2228) ( ). Afterwards, Fe 2 O 3 /NC was synthesized by a dry ball-milling of 98 mg NC and 2 mg commercial Fe 2 O 3 (96%, Sigma-Aldrich) for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm without heat treatment. The Fe content in Fe 2 O 3 /NC was ca. 1.3 wt%, as confirmed by ICP–OES. Commercial Fe–N–C catalyst (no. PMF-0110904, Pajarito Powder) was purchased from Pajarito Powder Inc, which is synthesized via hard templating with fumed silica. The carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported Fe-N-C catalyst (FeNC/CNT) was synthesized using a silica-protective-layer-assisted approach 41 . Then 100 mg of nitric acid-treated CNTs (Carbon Nanomaterial Technology) were mixed with 200 mg of Fe III TMPPCl (Porphyrin Systems) in an agate mortar for 5 min. The mixture was heated in a quartz-tube furnace, starting from room temperature to 673 K, at a ramping rate of 275 K min −1 and kept at that temperature for 3 h under N 2 gas (99.999%) flowing at a rate of 1 l min −1 . Afterwards, the heat-treated CNT/Fe III TMPPCl composite was mixed with 0.5 ml of TEOS in a mortar, followed by mixing with 0.5 ml of formic acid. The resulting mixture was transferred to an alumina crucible and dried in a 333 K oven for 3 h. Subsequently, the composite was heated to 1,073 K at a ramping rate of 275 K min −1 and maintained at that temperature for 3 h under N 2 gas flowing at a rate of 1 l min −1 . To etch the silica, the resulting composite was mixed with 2:1 (v/v) solution of ethanol and 10% aqueous HF, and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was then filtered and washed with ethanol multiple times. The HF etching process was repeated following the same procedure, and the resulting sample was dried at 333 K to obtain FeNC/CNT samples. Physicochemical
