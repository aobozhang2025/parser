at (a) 900 oC and (b) 1000 oC.
As can be seen, no any Ni-related crystalline phases were found at 900 oC. However,
when further increased to 1000 oC, such a high temperature inevitably leads to the
dissociation of N-doping species, such as Pyridine-N, Graphite-N and Pyridine-N.
Because of this, the Ni atoms should detach form these pre-formed Ni-N -C sites

without anchoring effect and they thus thermodynamically reaggregate into metal
particles, mainly due to their high surface free energy. These results suggest that the
structure of isolated Ni atom can be maintained to 900 oC.

No peaks associated with C-S-C (typically around 167 eV3) or metal-S bonds (ca. 174
and 183 eV3) were detected, indicating that there is negligible S-doping into the carbon
framework.
Supplementary XRD characterization of the intermediates during the pyrolytic
process of UHDTi–N–C SACs, showing the generation of a Ti S phase and then its

With heating to around 650 °C, the two obvious and diffraction peaks
associated with the interplanar packing of s-triazine units and π-π interlayer stacking4-7
of g-C N , were observed. Results confirm the successive trasformation of melon to
3 4
polymeric g-C N . During this process, peaks due to Ti S species also emerged. As
3 4 1.08 2
the temperature was gradually increased to 700 oC, the g-C N continously decomposed
3 4
and a graphitic peak located at ca. 25 o appeared, indicating the generation of a
N-doped carbon support. Apart from this, it is interesting to observe that the peak of
Ti S finally vanished. Also, no any peaks of Ti-containing species were observed at
1.08 2
700 oC or 800 oC. These obove discussions suggest the possible conversion of Ti S
1.08 2
phase to Ti single atoms.
Supplementary Note 5 DFT ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations
(Supplementary Figs. 66-71) were used to model the transition of M S nanoparticles
x y
to M–N –C sites, where the green, yellow, blue and grey spheres represent metal, S, N

and C atoms, respectively. The DFT calculations indicate that it requires energy input
to release a metal atom from the M S particle. However, once the removed metal atom
x y
is captured by N sites in the carbon support, the energy of the total reaction system can

be significantly reduced. As a consequence, our DFT analyses suggest that the M S
x y
nanoparticle-to-metal atom conversion is thermodynamically favored. The AIMD
dynamics simulations also indicate the driving force in the atomization process is the
potential energy decrease associated with forming a M–N –C moiety versus that of a

metal atom and N -containing vacancy defect.

capture by the ultrahigh N-doped carbon support in realizing ultrahigh loadings of
isolated Ni atoms.
Supplementary XRD patterns of the samples prepared at 800 oC without
adding thiourea and CDs.
The XRD pattern shows that Ni metal nanoparticles were produced in the absence of S
source, and that the Ni nanoparticles did not decompose to Ni atoms with heating. As a
result, carbon-supported Ni nanoparticles were obtained. These experimental results
highlight the indispensable functions of thermally-driven M S decomposition and the
x y
release of metal atoms in the particle-to-single atom conversion process to obtain highly
dispersed Ni single atoms. In the presence of thiourea but absence of CDs, Ni S was

the pyrolysis product.

In this strategy, urea is placed in the first stage, and a mixture of CDs, NiCl and thiourea

are placed in the second stage, with the pyrolytic condition being similar to that for the

XPS survey spectra and N-doping contents of the sample obtained at 800 oC via the
one-stage (UHDNi–N–C SACs) and two-stage pyrolysis methods.
To further experimentally demonstrate the critical role of CDs-induced confined
pyrolysis towards high N-dopants, we conducted control experiments based on a two-
stage technology. In the first stage, urea undergoes condensation to form g-C N . In the
3 4
second stage, mixtures of CDs, NiCl and thiourea are pyrolyzed to obtain carbon-based

materials. As such, the bonding interactions between g-C N and CDs-constructed
3 4
carbon support are avoided. Remarkably, the typical out-of-plane sp3 C-N (located at
ca. 286.5 eV) bonding bahevior8,9 is observed during the preparation of UHDNi–N–C
SACs. However, in stark contrast, the sp3 C–N bonding behavior is absent in the two-
stage pyrolysis process (as expected). Benefiting from this, the total N content of the
products obtained after 800 oC in the two-stage pyrolysis is as low as 8.0 at%, which is
only 30.7 % of the value for UHDNi–N–C SACs (26.1 at%). Based on the above
discussions, these results clearly demonstrate the critical role of the bonding interaction
between g-C N intermediate and CDs-induced carbon support during the pyrolysis
3 4

synthesis of UHDM-N-C SACs, and thus leads to the confined pyrolysis towards
achieving a high N-doping level.
Supplementary (a) XRD patterns, (b) XPS spectra, (c) variation of the total N-
doping content of the samples prepared at 800 oC without adding urea (no/UHDNi–N–

SACs) amount of urea used to prepare UHDNi–N–C SACs.
It is obviously shown that Ni S phases were always detected in the situation of relative
3 2
low N-doping content below 20 at%. These experimental results together with the
theoretical investigations evidenced that constructing N-doped carbons with very high
N contents should been critically important for triggerring the metal sulfide particles
into highly loaded Ni–N coordinated single atoms, matching well with the discussions
in the Introduction section.
Supplementary XRD patterns analyzing the intermediate species variation during
the pyrolysis in 600, 700 and 800 oC for the samples with 25 % addition of melamine
relative to that of UHDNi–N–C SACs.
Generally, although the peak strength of NiS intermediate decreased to some extent as the
temperature increased (Supplementary , suggesting the decomposition of partial
NiS particles, there was a lack of sufficient N dopants to stabilize the Ni atoms and they
thus reaggregated into Ni S particles. These experimental results suggest that competing
3 2
atomization and sintering processes occur when the N-doping content in the carbon support
is low. In the situation where the N-doping content is not enough, the competing metal
sintering reaction dominates the atom migration pathway, distinct from the case in the

preparation of UHDNi–N–C SACs where N-dopant sites are abundant.

and Ni–N–C SACs-7.1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. (d) Comparison
of the mass specific activity of Ni at 1.55 V versus RHE.
The three-electrode cell used for the electrochemical OER tests consisted of a working
electrode (carbon paper-loaded catalyst), a counter electrode (graphite rod), and a reference
electrode (SCE, Hg/Hg Cl ). For all the OER measurements in this work, the distance
2 2
between working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode was ca. 2 cm. Based
on the results at 1.55 V versus RHE, the mass specific activity could be increased from
31.1 to 63.6 A g −1 when the Ni loading was increased from 7.1 to 23.3 wt%, verifying
Ni
metal loading-dependent intrinsic activity in electrocatalytic OER.

The Ni-NC-con, herein applied as a control, was prepared without the addition of S source
and the amount of NiCl ·6H O was adjusted to obtain a Ni loading content of 23.0 wt%,

which is similar to that of UHDNi–N–C SACs. The XRD pattern shows the sample
contained metallic Ni (PDF#87-0712), with Ni nanoparticles on the carbon substrate
clearly observable in the TEM images.
Supplementary Note 7 Mechanistic insights of the atom site density-induced synergistic
effect in activity.
All the calculations were performed within the DFT framework as implemented in the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The exchange-correlation functional adopted
the expression of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) in the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) method. Meanwhile, the Grimme method (DFT-D3) was introduced
to consider the weak van der Waals interactions. The solution of a single electron
wavefunction at the ground state utilized the projected augmented wave (PAW) method in
a real space with a cutoff energy of 550 eV for the planewave basis set. The iterative
convergence of energy and force was 10−6 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. A 8 × 8
rectangle graphene was used as the support layer. To model the atom site density-induced
synergistic effect on the catalytic performance, we constructed six models including
Ni1(one Ni atom embedded in the support layer), Ni2a (two Ni atoms embedded in the
support layer, Ni-Ni distance is at 5.03 Å), Ni2b (Ni-Ni distance is at 8.63 Å), Ni2c (Ni-Ni
distance is at 9.58 Å), Ni3-a (additional Ni is added onto Ni2a), and Ni3b (additional Ni is
added onto Ni2b). These models represent the Ni atom number density at 0.90 at%, 1.82
at%, and 2.75 at%, respectively. For comparison, we also studied a Ni cluster model of 8
atoms on a carbon support, named as Ni . The Brillouin zone in the reciprocal space
cluster
was sampled by the Monkhorst-Pack scheme using a 2 × 2 × 1 k-point grid for geometry
optimization and 3  3  1 for self-consistent field calculation. A 15 Å lattice constant along
the z-axis was set to avoid the layer image coupling caused by the periodic model.
The adsorption energy (ΔE ) of H O was calculated as ΔE = E – (E

H2O H2O/substrate, substrate H2O 2
substrate and free H O molecule, respectively. Based on a computational hydrogen

electrode model introduced by Nørskov et al.10, the Gibbs free energy was defined by the
following equation:
ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE - TΔS + ΔG + ΔG .

Where ΔZPE is the zero-point energy of adsorbed species and ΔS is the entropy difference
at room temperature. ΔG and ΔG are the contributions to the free energy due to the
U pH
change of the electrode potential (U) and the pH value, respectively. ΔG = -neU, in which
U
n is the number of transferred electrons and U is the applied potential. ΔG = k T × ln10

and entropies of the intermediates were obtained by calculating the vibrational frequencies.
The limiting potential (U ) is defined as the maximum free energy change (ΔG ) among
L max
all elementary steps along the most favorable pathway. More specifically, we modelled the
OER process based on the adsorbate evaluation reaction (AEM). The reaction proceeds as
four electron-proton transfer steps:
