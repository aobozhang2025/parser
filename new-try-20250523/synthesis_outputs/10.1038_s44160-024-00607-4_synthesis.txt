Well-crystallized CDs with a size of 5 -10 nm were used in the preparation of the UHDM -N-C SACs , as observed in the high -resolution TEM (HR -TEM) images in 2), evidencing the successful synthesis of CDs. The functional groups , elemental composition and crystalline structure of the CDs were probed by X -ray photoelectron during the preparation of UHDNi –N–C SACs , confirming the N -doping of the carbon framework. preparation of UHDNi –N–C SACs .

(e) XPS survey spectra and N-doping contents of the sample obtained at 800 oC via the one-stage ( UHDNi –N–C SACs) and two -stage pyrolysis methods . To further experimentally demonstrate th e critical role of CDs -induced confined pyrolysis towards high N -dopants , we conducted control experiments based on a two- stage technology . In the first stage, urea undergoes condensation to form g -C3N4. In the second stage , mixtures of CDs, NiCl 2 and thiourea are pyrolyzed to obtain carbon -based materials. As such, the bonding interactions between g -C3N4 and CDs -constructed carbon support are avoided. Remarkably, the typical out-of-plane sp3 C-N (located at ca. 286.5 eV) bonding bahevior8,9 is observed during the preparation of UHDNi –N–C SACs . However, in stark contrast, the sp3 C–N bond ing behavior is absent in the two - stage pyrolysis process ( as expected ). Benefiting from this , the total N content of the products obtained after 800 oC in the two-stage pyrolysis is as low as 8.0 at%, which is only 30.7 % of the value for UHDNi –N–C SACs (26.1 at%) . Based on the above discussions, these r esults clearly demonstrate the critical role of the bonding interaction between g-C3N4 intermediate and CDs -induced carbon support during the pyrolysis synthesis of UHDM -N-C SACs , and thus leads to the confined pyrolysis towards achieving a high N -doping level. preparation of UHDNi –N–C SACs where N -dopant sites are abundant . 3.
