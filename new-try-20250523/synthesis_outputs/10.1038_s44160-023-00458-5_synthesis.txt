The experime nts were performed with an SP-150 electrochemical workstation via a conven tional three-electrode system in a 0.5 M Na 2SO 4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.8). The Ag / AgCl electrode was employed as the respectively. Photocurrent measurements. Photoelectrochemical measurements were si milar to Mott-Schottky measurement with CHI 660e electrochemical workstation in a standard three-electr ode electrochemical cell with a working electrode, a platinum pl ate as counter electr ode and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode . The detailed preparation of working electrodes was in line with the above experiments. A Xe non light with UV-Vis spectra (λ = 350 - 780 nm) was applied as the light source for Photocurrent, and 0.5 M Na 2SO 4 aqueous solution was used as the elect rolyte. During the photoelectrochemical measurements, the distance between th e light source and three-electrode electrochemical cell was about 20 cm, and a -5 .0 mV bias potential was applied for the testing of photocurrent-time (I-t) curves. When the background current was stabilized, the working electrode was illuminated for 20s (light on) and then the light source was shielded for 20s (light off) , repeated the above operation and recorded the photocurrent- time (I-t) curves through the electrochemi cal workstation, and finally obtained the photocurrent curve.

Supplementary Note 5: Detailed Procedures of Photocatalytic and Triple Tandem Reaction experiments. General Procedure for Photocatalytic CO 2 Reduction Experiments. The photocatalytic CO 2RR was carried out in a 25 mL qua rtz reactor at a temperature of 25 °C maintained by using a circulating-water bath to en sure constant temperature. These crystalline catalysts were milled into pow ders using an agate mortar, catalyst (5 mg) and [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2·6H 2O (0.027 mmol) were added into the mixed solution which contained acetonitrile (4 mL), TEOA (1 mL, 7.5 mmol) and deionized water (200 μL) and dispersed by constant magnetic stirring in solution. The reaction system was saturated by CO 2 for 15 min at 1 atm CO 2 partial pressure and th en irradiated using a Xenon lamp (350nm - 780 nm, 300 W). The typi cal test is 8 hours. The gas products in the headspace of the reactor were measured using GC with an FID detector to analyze CO/CH 4/CO 2 and a TCD detector to analyze H 2. Tandem selective hydrogenation reaction (one pot method). All reactions were done in only one cham ber (A chamber). The photocatalytic CO reduction experiment was prep ared according to the above general procedure, then addition of different amounts (0.01-0.1 mmol) of alkyne organics before the end of filling with CO 2 gas. The mixed solution wa s irradiated under vi sible light for 8 h. The reaction product was detected and quantifie d by mass spectromet ry (5977B Agilent Technologies), and NMR analysis after pu rification by column chromatography on silica gel. The gas products were measured us ing GC with an FID detector to analyze CO/CH 4/CO 2 and a TCD detector to analyze H 2. Triple Tandem Reaction Experiments (dual-chamber method). These experiments were performed in two- chamber system. All organic measurements were carried out under equivalent experiment al conditions. Achieving high gas density in the reaction volume, the relatively small volume of the chamber reactor (Schlenk tube) was selected (A chamber, 25 mL a nd B chamber, 10 mL). chamber A was used for tandem selective hydrogenation reaction acco rding to the protocol above (substrate: 5 μL phenylacetylene). The reaction conditions in chamber B was loaded with aryl iodide (0.1 mmol), Pd(PPh 3)4 (0.025 mmol), Et 3N (139.0 μL, 1.0 mmol), and the corresponding terminal alkyne or amine or aryl boronic ac id (0.2 mmol). Subsequently, anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (3 mL) was added to the reactor. The two chambers were chained together by a short linker, all joints were in a closed stat e. Subsequently, only open the joint of B, and the B chamber was then flash froze n at 77 K (liquid N 2 bath) and degassed by three freeze-pump-thaw cycles, and evacuated to an internal pressure of ~100 mTorr. Then warm to room temperature, A chamber was placed under photocatalytic conditions, the B chamber was placed in an oil bath. After 8h photocatalytic reacting, inject ions of 5.2 mL MeCN was made in A chamber to increase the density of the gas in the container. S ubsequently, A’s joint was slowly opened and B chamber was stirred at 65°C for 16 h in the oil bath. The reaction product was detected and quantified by mass spectrome try (5977B Agilent Technologies) and NMR analysis after purifica tion by column chromat ography on silica gel. Supplementary Note 6: Computational details Calculation of exciton binding energy. In order to further verify the efficiency of exciton separation (or charge separation) in Ni 5 cluster and Ni5W10, we calculated the Coulomb attr action energies (Ec) between electrons and holes in 5 excited states (S1- S5). A smaller Ec value typically indicates a higher exciton separation efficiency. In this study, Geometry optimization and of all of the investigated gases a nd clusters was conducted using the density func tional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functiona l theory (TD-DFT) method at the B3LYP- GD3(BJ)/6-311G* level of theory and was accomplished with the aid of the Gaussian 16 software program 4. B3LYP-GD3(BJ), which is an exchange–correlation functional with the D3 version of Grimme’s dispersion correction encompassing the famous Becke-Johnson damping was utilized for this study as it serves best for accurately predicting weak interactions and also mostly applied for adsorption studies as seen in reported works of several authors5,6. We also used Multiwfn 3.8 to perform an electron- hole analysis7. Calculation of catalytic reactions. All the calculations of catalytic reactions are performed within the framework of DFT implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (V ASP)8-10. The generalized gradient approximation with the functi onal is described by the Perdew-Burke- Ernzerhof type (PBE)11. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method12-14 is applied to describe the wavefunctions in the core regions, while the valence wavefunctions are expanded as linear combinati on of plane-waves with a cu toff energy of 400 eV . The total energy is converged to 10-5 eV in the geometry optimizations, and the Hellmann– Feynman force on each relaxed atom is less than 0.02 eV/Å. Photocatalytic CO 2RR Process: In the first part, the Gi bbs reaction free energy of reaction for CO 2RR and HER of elemen tary steps involving (H+ + e–) pair transfer was calculated using computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model15. At U=0 V , ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + CPdT, where ΔE is the reaction energy difference between the product and reactant of the CO 2RR occurring on catalysts, which can be directly obtained from DFT computations; ΔEZPE, TΔS and CpdT are zero-point energy correction, entropy correction and enthal pic temperature correction at T=298.15 K respectively, which were calculated from the vibrational frequencies. The ΔEZPE, TΔS and CpdT for each reaction intermediates can be calculated by the following equations, respectively: 2ZPE i iE hv = 1ln(1 ) ( ) 1i B i Bhv KT Bi hv ii KTTS K T e hv e− −= − − − 1() 1i Bpi hv i KTCd T h v e= − where h, v and KB are Planck constant, vibrational frequencies and Boltzmann constant, respectively.

C. 2020, 124, 31, The second part of the calculation involve s the dynamic process of H transfer. To compare the kinetic energy barriers of the H+ transfers from the solvent to either the Ni site for HER or the C sites for the reducti on of alkynes, all elementary steps were calculated using the c limbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) approach16. The minimum energy path was examined using 8 images, including th e initial and final state, during the transition st ate search. we applied a hybrid explicit-impli cit approach to simulate the solvation effect. Specifi cally, we place a water network consisting of four water molecules on top the Ni site to construct a metal-solvent interface and to stabilize the H + in the solvent. We then use the implicit model to account for long range solvation effect and neutralizes the char ged ions, which is essential for periodic calculations, it presents the merits of a low computational cost and qualitatively accurate results. the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) as implement in V ASP (V ASPsol) is applied14. To validate our model, we compare the energy barriers for the V olmer and Heyrovsky steps with other system s and the results are in the reasonable range. It can be noted that the V olmer step is often in lower in energy comparing with the Heyrovsky step. The former step can be mainly contributed by the breaking of the hydrogen bonding of the proton in the water network (-0.31 eV)17,18. Only the entry 1 is calculated for the whole process and we assume the re action mechanism can be also applied to other systems. Supplementary Note 7: Ph otophysical experiments. Photoluminescent (PL) que nching experiments. The excitation wavelength was 400 nm when steady-state PL was measured using Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer. All of the solution systems were bubbled with CO 2 for 15 min to dissolve oxygen and maintain saturated conditions. At the end of ventilation, To probe the fluor escence quenching of [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2·6H 2O by Ni 5W10 / Ni6W10 catalysts or organic substrates, the photoluminescent quenching measurements were performed in MeCN / H 2O (20:1, 10 mL) mixed so lution containing 0.02 mM [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2·6H 2O. The steady-state PL spectra of a mixed solution containing [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2·6H 2O were performed upon the addi tion of increasing amounts of catalysts (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg) or phenylacetylene (0.00, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00 mM). Fluorescence intensity was then evaluated. Photoluminescence lifet ime experiments. The samples were excited by the incident li ght of 390 nm and the PL decay spectra at 605 nm were monitored using PICOQuant FT-300 spectrofluorometer. These solution systems were bubbled with CO 2 for 15 min to dissolve oxygen and maintain saturated conditions. The mixed solution contained aceto nitrile and deionized water (20:1). Then [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2·6H 2O (0.02 mM) was dissolved in 10 mL of the abovementioned mixed solution. Finally, 5 mg catalyst or 5 μL phenylacetylene was added and the solution underwent ultrasonication to disperse the catalyst uniformly. Photoluminescence lifetimes were tested subsequently. Supplementary Note 8: XPS measurements. First, these crystalline catalysts ( Ni5W10 and Ni6W10) were ground into powder and activated at 100 ℃ under vacuum. Second, the catalys t was mixed and stirred with MeCN solution containing phenylacetylene (100 μL/mL) for adsorption. The sample was collected by centrifugation and dried at 25 ℃ under vacuum for 24 h. Final, the resultant sample was used for XPS measurements19. In our work, the adsorption free energies of phenylacetylene on catalysts we re -0.65 eV or -0.73 eV , which mean that the chemisorption was a spontaneous proces s. Meanwhile, the XPS
