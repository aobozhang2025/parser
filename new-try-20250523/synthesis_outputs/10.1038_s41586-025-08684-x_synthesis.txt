synthesis of the nanosized CeAlO 3 phase We show below our approach to synthesize nanosized crystals of CeAlO 3 (~25 nm crystal size) starting with the 50% ceria/aumina support (CeAl50) that we have used in this work. By aging the sample in the presence of reactants at 900 °C, we did not observe the formation of CeAlO 3. However, treatment at 1,150 °C led to complete transformation of ceria into ~ 25nm CeAlO 3 crystals as evidenced by XRD and microscopy The fraction of Ce3+ and Ce4+ was determined by two different methods (described below). Note: CeO 2 has a very small pre -edge peak (5.719 keV) and 3 peaks at 5.7241, 5.7280 and 5.7352 keV (ChemPhysChem 2016, 17, 3494 – 3503); Ce3+ has a single peak at lower energy. Also, as an L 3 edge, the XANES shape and energy is dependent on the exact number of bonds and bond distance to the absorbing atom. Thus, determination of a Ce3+ XANES from this oxide is necessary to get a more precise XANES fit for the composition. Previously, many papers use Ce(NO 3)3 x H 2O for Ce3+ XANES fitting; however, these oxides likely have a different CN and R, thus, a better choice is a Ce3+ from the phase that is present. L3 Ce XANES from 5.68 -5.75 keV for Ce 4+ and Ce3+ CeA08 Oxides CeAl08 CeO 2 (Ce4+ as received) CeAl08 Ce 2O3 NOTE: The Ce3+ CA08 oxide was obtained by: 1) The fraction of Ce4+ (0.34) in the reactively 900 °C CeAl08 aged sample reduced in H 2 400 C was determined by the ratio of the height of the peak in both samples at 5.7352 keV where there is no peak in Ce3+ samples; 2) The XANES of the Ce4+ CeAl08 (as received) sample, was multiplied by 0.34 and subtracted from the C eAl08 aged sample reduced in H 2 400 C sample; and 3) The difference XANES spectrum, i.e., Ce3+ CeAl08 oxide, which represents 66% of the Ce in the sample, was normalized by dividing by 0.66. Note: CeO 2 has a very small pre -edge peak (5.719 keV) and 3 peaks at 5.7241, 5.7280 and 5.7352 keV (ChemPhysChem 2016, 17, 3494 – 3503); Ce3+ is a single peak at lower energy. 1. CA08 as is XANES energy shape, EXAFS and higher shells are identical to the CeO 2 Standard a. CeO 2 has a very small pre -edge peak (5.719 keV) and 3 peaks at 5.7241, 5.7280 and 5.7352 keV ( Physica Scripta 2005, T115, 802 –806; ChemPhysChem 2016, 17, 3494 – 3503) b. CeAl08 has the same 4 peaks as CeO 2 at the same energies; this is used at the Ce4+ XANES reference. c. Method 1: Ce3+ compounds do not have a XANES peak at 5.7352 keV (see reference literature compounds). The fraction of Ce4+ was determined from the height of this peak (above the normalized edge step) compared to that for CeO 2 (CeAl08). d. Method 2: A Ce3+ reference for this oxide was determine by determining the fraction of Ce4+ for sample C eAl08 aged reduced at 400 °C in H 2. The ratio of the heights (method 1) gave 34% Ce4+. The XANES of C eAl08 was multiplied by 0.34 and subtracted from CA08 aged reduced at 400 °C in H 2. The difference file gave no peak at 5.7352 keV indicating all the Ce4+ had been removed from the spectrum. The resulting XANES was due to 66% of the Ce in the sample. This Ce3+ XANES was normalized by dividing the spectrum by 0.66 and used as a C e3+ CeAl08 oxide to fit the other mixed valent state CA08 oxides. e. The fraction of Ce3+ in the other samples was determined by a linear combination of the Ce3+ and Ce4+ CA08 oxides. There is a n agreement between these two methods in estimating the relative fractions of Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ (the only two oxidation states of ceria in our samples) for various C eAl08 samples.
