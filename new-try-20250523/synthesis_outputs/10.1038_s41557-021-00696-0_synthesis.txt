Materials and Methods
Precursors.
High purity oxide and carbonate precursors, such as La O (Pi-Kem, >99.99%) and TiO (Alfa
2 3 2
Aesar, >99.6%), BaCO (Alfa Aesar, >99%), CaCO (Fisher Chemical, >99%) and SrCO
3 3 3
(Aldrich, >99.9%), are dried at 300 oC (La O at 800 oC) in order to remove water bound
2 3
molecules from the precursors for a correct stoichiometric nature of the perovskites. PtO (Alfa

Aesar, anhydrous) and Pt nitrate solution (Johnson Matthey, 16.17 wt% Pt) are used as Pt
precursors, and γ−Al O (Sasol, Particle size ≤ 5 mm, S 138−158 m2/g) is purchased.

BaCO and PtO are weighed and mixed together in the correct stoichiometric amount in a Pt
3 2
crucible, and then fired in air in a furnace with a ramp rate of 5 ºC/min to 1000°C for 12 hrs.

quantitatively transferred to a glass beaker, then acetone is added to the beaker with a co-
polymer dispersant (Hypermer KD-1, a polyester copolymer surfactant). The mixture is pulse
sonicated using an ultrasonic probe (Heilscher UP200S) in order to homogenise and reduce the
particle size of the precursors. Following dispersion, acetone is evaporated from the
homogeneous solution and the compositional mixture is then calcined in a muffle furnace at
1000 ºC for 12 hrs to partially form the perovskite phase for seeding crystallisation. Following
calcination, the sample is ball milled with acetone at 300 rpm for 2 hrs in a planetary ball mill,
using 1 mm zirconia balls. Then, the sample is dried in an evaporator dish at room temperature.
O -rich sintering process.

Pellets are prepared by pressing the sample powders and then firing them under O -rich sintering

conditions to produce pure perovskite phase at the relatively low temperatures. Pellets are fired
for 12 hrs at 1200 ºC with a ramp rate of 5 ºC/min in an O -rich gas atmosphere of 100% O and
2 2
100 ml·min−1.
In-situ emergence process.
To emerge the Pt NPs onto the perovskite surface, samples are chemically reduced in a
controlled atmosphere furnace at 700 oC for 12 hrs with heating and cooling rates of 5 °C·min−1
under continuous flow of 5% H /Ar (20 ml·min−1). The emerged Pt perovskites are denoted as

Pt+LCT and Pt+LST.
Reference samples.
For a comparison, Pt impregnated LCT (Pt/LCT) and Pt/γ−Al O catalysts are synthesized by
2 3
the incipient wetness method. Constant Pt concentration of 0.5 wt% was impregnated to the
supports by a Pt nitrate solution, then dried at 110 °C for 24 hrs and calcined at 550 °C for 3 hrs
in air. The Pt/LCT and Pt/γ−Al O samples are reduced in 5% H /Ar flow for 12 hrs at 700 oC
2 3 2
and 500 oC, respectively.
X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD).

XRD measurements are carried out at room temperature with an x-ray angle from 10-90o by
using a PAN analytical Empyrean diffractometer with CuKα1 radiation (1.54056Å) and Bragg-
Brentanon geometry operated in reflection mode. STOE Win XPOW software is used to analyze
the diffraction pattern and interoperate the crystal structure and cell parameter. GSAS open
source refinement software is applied for carrying out Rietveld refinement of the results to find
out the original perovskite phase and structural changes. The structural information is then used
to construct the crystal structure by using Crystal Maker for Windows software.
X-ray absorption spectra (XAS).
The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) of the Pt L -edge for selected samples are collected at ambient temperature, on the
III
B18 station at Diamond Light Source national synchrotron facility, UK. Measurements are
carried out using a Si monochromator at Pt L -edge with a Pt monometallic foil (10 μm)
III
used as an energy calibrant. Samples are pressed into 13 mm pellets, and high Pt loaded samples
are diluted using appropriate amount of cellulose binder. Pt foil and PtO are used as references

for Pt0 and Pt4+, respectively. XAS data analysis was carried out with the software of Athena and
Artemis .
EXAFS fitting
The EXAFS functions were Fourier transformed in the k range of 3–13.86 Å-1 and multiplied by
a Hanning window. The basic structural model was a (fcc) Pt metal core from the ICSD code of
