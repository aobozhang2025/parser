synthesis procedure could introduce additional H bonded with C atoms. Our DFT results in
Supplementary indicate that some anti-bonding orbital (i.e., spin-up part) of Fe
3d will participate in the Fe-N bond formation, leading to weaker Fe-N interaction and
xy
correspondingly longer Fe-N bond in the traditional FeN site without adsorbed H. In contrast,

only the bonding orbitals of Fe 3d participate in the Fe-N bond formation, leading to stronger
xy
Fe-N interaction and correspondingly shorter Fe-N bond in our modeled S1-4H site. This result
reveals that the introduction of additional H on the C atoms surrounding the FeN site could

modify the electronic structure of the Fe-N bonds (i.e., without the contribution from the anti-
bonding orbitals to the bond formation) in the S1-4H site and thus shorten the Fe-N bonds than
those in the traditional FeN

site.

Supplementary Note 5:
The intrinsic catalytic activity of FeN sites with/without H adsorption following the

4e− associative ORR pathway was investigated. The ORR on the S1-4H site becomes an
exothermic reaction when the electrode potential is lower than a limiting potential of 0.58(cid:3031)V,
higher than that of 0.57 V on the S1 site. In addition, the ORR limiting potential was predicted
to increase from 0.61 V on the S2 site to 0.67 V on the S2-4H site. These computational results
indicate that introducing H would enhance the intrinsic ORR activity of FeN

sites. Moreover,
Bader charge analysis quantitatively showed that the electron accumulation was 0.18e on the
S1 type FeN site and 0.37e on the S2 type FeN site after hydrogen attached to carbon.

Recognizing that the ORR intermediate belongs to nucleophiles, introducing surface H near
the FeN site will weaken the adsorption of the ORR intermediate and thus improve the overall

ORR activity.
