Synthesis of different Cu loading amorphous ZrO . CAZ - x (x=2, 4, 8, 12, 15) were synthesized by modified co - precipitation with Na CO as precipitant. Firstly, weighing Cu( NO ) ·3H O ( Sigma - Aldrich, 98% - 103% ) and Zr(NO ) ·5H O (Macklin, AR ) precursors according to the metal loading and dissolved them together into 100 m L deionized water to make a 0.03 M solution, which was recorded as solution A. Then it was weighed an appropriate amount of Na CO and dissolved it in m L de ionized water to make a 0.06 M solution, which was marked as solution B. After the dissolution completed, a peristaltic pump was used to slowly drip the two solutions A and B into another beaker containing 100 m L of deionized water at a rate of 0.3 m L /min. During the dropping process, the stirring maintained at 350 rpm/min and heated at 80 °C until the dropping was completed. Then stopped stirring and aged at 80 °C for 2 h. After aging, cooled it to room temperature and washed with deionized water to pH=7, followed by drying in an oven at 80 °C overnight. Finally, it was ground into powder and calcined in a muffle furnace at 2 °C/min to 350 °C for 5 h. CAZ - - H was synthesized by soaking 1 g CAZ - 15 in 20 m L HNO for 20 h, dried , and calcined at 350 o C for 5 h. S ynthesis of CMZ - 15 and CS - 15. Two samples were synthesized by impregnation. Before the impregnation experiment, the nano - ZrO ( Aladdin 99.8%, mentals basis ) and nano - SiO ( Aladdin 99.99%, mentals basis ) support s should be dried overnight in an oven to remove internal moisture. First, weighed the Cu(NO ) ·3H O ( Sigma - Aldrich, 98% - 103% ) precursor according to the metal loading and dissolved it in 4 m L of deionized water to form a solution, and then added to 4 g carrier dropwise with constant stirring. After the addition was completed, the solution was dispersed ultrasonically for 1 hour. Finally, stirred and evaporated it to dryness, ground into a powd er, and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h. c properties of copper/zirconia catalysts for the synthesis of methanol from carbon dioxide.
