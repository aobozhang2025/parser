Synthesis of different Cu loading amorphous ZrO . CAZ-x (x=2, 4, 8, 12, 15) were synthesized
by modified co-precipitation with Na CO as precipitant. Firstly, weighing Cu(NO ) ·3H O (Sigma-

Aldrich, 98%-103%) and Zr(NO ) ·5H O (Macklin, AR) precursors according to the metal loading
3 4 2
and dissolved them together into 100 mL deionized water to make a 0.03 M solution, which was
recorded as solution A. Then it was weighed an appropriate amount of Na CO and dissolved it in
2 3
100 mL deionized water to make a 0.06 M solution, which was marked as solution B. After the
dissolution completed, a peristaltic pump was used to slowly drip the two solutions A and B into
another beaker containing 100 mL of deionized water at a rate of 0.3 mL/min. During the dropping
process, the stirring maintained at 350 rpm/min and heated at 80 °C until the dropping was
completed. Then stopped stirring and aged at 80 °C for 2 h. After aging, cooled it to room
temperature and washed with deionized water to pH=7, followed by drying in an oven at 80 °C
overnight. Finally, it was ground into powder and calcined in a muffle furnace at 2 °C/min to 350 °C
for 5 h. CAZ-15-H was synthesized by soaking 1 g CAZ-15 in 20 mL HNO for 20 h, dried, and

calcined at 350 oC for 5 h.

Synthesis of CMZ-15 and CS-15. Two samples were synthesized by impregnation. Before the
impregnation experiment, the nano-ZrO (Aladdin 99.8%, mentals basis) and nano-SiO (Aladdin
2 2
99.99%, mentals basis) supports should be dried overnight in an oven to remove internal moisture.
First, weighed the Cu(NO ) ·3H O (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%-103%) precursor according to the metal
3 2 2
loading and dissolved it in 4 mL of deionized water to form a solution, and then added to 4 g carrier
dropwise with constant stirring. After the addition was completed, the solution was dispersed
ultrasonically for 1 hour. Finally, stirred and evaporated it to dryness, ground into a powder, and
calcined at 500 °C for 5 h.

XANES spectra, k2-weighted experimental EXAFS oscillations of CAZ-1 (a) and initial CAZ-1
measured inside cell (b). The evolution of XANES spectra of CAZ-1 (in-situ) over acquisition time
under reaction condition (c). CAZ-1 (in-situ, merge) represents the rational merging of multiple
curves to increase the intensity of the signal after the XANES spectrum of the CAZ-1 has stabilized.
Fitting of k2-weighted EXAFS data of the different catalysts: CAZ-15 (d) and CMZ-15 (e) in R-
space, CAZ-1 (f), CAZ-1-U (g), CAZ-1 (in-situ) (h), CAZ-15 (i), and CMZ-15 (j) in k-space.
According to the quality of k-space data, the range of k values for different samples were as follows:
f. 2.67~9.06 Å-1; g. 2.60~9.01 Å-1; h. 2.67~7.26 Å-1; i. 2.62~8.98 Å-1; j. 2.82~7.43 Å-1. U: used
catalyst. Note: the XAS spectra of CAZ-1 and CAZ-1 measured inside cell (a, b) were almost the
same, indicating that the in-situ reaction cell did not have any effect on the acquisition of the signal.
For the time-resolved test (c), the spectra of CAZ-1 at 20 min, 60 min, 120 min and 180 min were
almost the same, suggesting that the copper species in CAZ-1 could be rapidly activated and remain
stable under the reaction conditions.

hydrogen dissociation ability after carrying copper species, even stronger than the metallic Cu
