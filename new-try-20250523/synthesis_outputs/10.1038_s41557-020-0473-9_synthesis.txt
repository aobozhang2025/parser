Preparation of iridium nanoparticles on Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (Ir/C)
Iridium nanoparticles were synthesized by a modified literature procedure

. A solution of IrCl

(0.06 mmol, 17.9 mg) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (
M
W
, 29,000, 100 mg) in ethylene glycol (15 ml) was stirred for 1 h and then transferred into a 25 ml Telfon-lined stainless-steel autoclave followed by heating at 200 °C for 2.4 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the iridium nanoparticles were obtained after washing and centrifuging with acetone and ethanol three times. The iridium nanoparticles and 100 mg carbon black (Vulcan XC-72) were dispersed in 15 ml ethanol with overnight stirring. The product was separated and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. After that, the as-obtained product was placed in a tube furnace and then heated in air at 180 °C for 0.5 h to remove surfactant (polyvinylpyrrolidone) of Ir/C (
,

). The iridium weight percent of Ir/C was determined to be 5.6 wt% by ICP-AES measurement.
Characterization
The crystalline structure and phase purity were determined using a Rigaku RU-200b X-ray powder diffractometer with CuKa radiation (
λ
= 1.5418 Å). Diffuse reflectance spectra were collected using an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (U-3900). The metal concentrations of the M

/CNs were measured by ICP-AES. The sizes and morphologies of the catalysts were observed on a Hitachi H-800 TEM. The high-resolution HAADF-STEM characterization was performed using a probe aberration-corrected microscope (JEOL JEM-ARM200F) equipped with cold emitter operating at 300 kV. The attainable spatial resolution of this microscope is 78 pm. XPS experiments were performed on a ULVAC PHI Quantera microprobe. Binding energies were calibrated by setting the measured binding energy of carbon 1
s
to 284.8 eV. The in situ environmental microscopic study was performed on a Titan ETEM microscope (FEI) operating at 300 kV. The sampling nanoparticles are diluted in ethanol and dispersed with ultrasonic waves. The solution was then cast onto a MEMS in situ heating chip, blow dried with dry air and mounted on a functional TEM holder (DENSsolutions, wildfire). Both the chip and the sample holder were plasma cleaned by 30 min to avoid cross-pollution. After casting, the chip and the holder were again cleaned by ultraviolet radiation for 5 min under 35 mbar vacuum to remove the residual organics. The gaseous environment was created inside the ETEM column with pure argon (99.9995%) and heated by the MEMS heater integrated with the chip. Raman measurements were performed on a Horiba HR-800 spectrometer.
Ex-situ XAFS measurements
The X-ray absorption fine structure spectra data (Pt L

-edge, Ir L

-edge, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni and Mn K-edges) were collected at station 1W1B in the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (operating at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA) and station BL14W1 in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (operating at 3.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA). The XAFS data of the M

/CN samples were collected at room temperature in the fluorescence excitation mode using a Lytle detector and all of the references (metal powder, foils and oxide bulks) were recorded in the transmission mode using an ionization chamber. All of the samples were pelletized as disks 13 mm in diameter with 1 mm thicknesses, using graphite powder as a binder.
In situ XAFS measurements
A home-made electrochemical cell was used for in situ XAFS measurements. Electrochemical measurements were conducted on a computer-controlled electrochemical analyser. Catalyst-modified carbon paper was used as the working electrode, a graphite rod electrode was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode was used (SCE, Hg/Hg

Cl

) as the reference electrode.
XAFS analysis and results
We processed the acquired EXAFS data according to the standard procedures by using the ATHENA module of the IFEFFIT v.1.2.11 software packages

. We obtained the EXAFS spectra through post-edge background subtraction from the overall absorption and normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step;
χ
(
k
) data were then Fourier transformed to real (R) space by using Hanning windows (d
k
= 1.0 Å
−1
) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells.
R
represents the radial distribution function. Least-squares curve-parameter fitting was carried out using the ARTEMIS module of the IFEFFIT software packages to obtain the quantitative structural parameters around central atoms

.
The following EXAFS equation was used:
$$\chi \left( k \right) = \mathop {\sum}\limits_j {\frac{{N_jS_0^2F_j\left( k \right)}}{{kR_j^2}}} \exp [ - 2k^2\sigma _j^2]\exp \left[ {\frac{{ - 2R_j}}{{\lambda \left( k \right)}}} \right]\sin [2k\,R_j + \varphi _j\left( k \right)]$$

N

σ

is the Debye–Waller parameter of the
j

were calculated with the ab initio code FEFF8.2
The iridium L

-edge theoretical XANES simulations were carried out with the FDMNES code in the framework of real-space full multiple-scattering scheme using the muffin-tin approximation for the potential. The energy dependent exchange-correlation potential was calculated with the real Hedin–Lundqvist scheme and then the spectra were convoluted using a Lorentzian function with an energy-dependent width to account for broadening due to the core-hole width and the final state width

Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode system controlled by a CHI 660 electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua) and a potentiostat (V3, Princeton Applied Research). A glassy carbon electrode (5 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode, a graphite rod electrode was used as the counter electrode, and a double salt bridge SCE (Hg/Hg

Cl

) was used as the reference electrode. KNO

solution (3 M) filled the second salt bridge to prevent the KCl of the first salt bridge from directly penetrating into the electrochemical test solution. The SCE was calibrated with the RHE. The calibration was taken in the hydrogen-saturated electrolyte with a platinum wire as the working electrode. Positive and negative linear-sweep voltammetry scans were measured at scan rates of 10 mV s
−1
, and the average of the two potentials (where the current crossed zero) was regarded as the potential of the calibration value.

DFT calculations
Computational details
All of the calculations were performed by periodic DFT with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package

,

. The projector augmented-wave method was used to describe the interaction between the atomic cores and electrons with a kinetic cutoff of 400 eV (
). We applied the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange and correlation functional

. To modularize the Ir

, respectively. A sphere nanocluster with a radius of ~7 Å (166 iridium atoms) was built to model the iridium nanoparticles and allow comparison of the electrocatalytic reactivity between a single dispersed iridium site and iridium nanoparticles.

Gibbs free energy profile in FAOR
First, following the methodology developed by Norskov et al. at standard conditions (
U
= 0, pH = 0,
p
= 1 bar,
T
= 298 K), ∆
G
of *AH → A + H
+
+ e
−
equals ∆
G
of *AH → A + 1/2H

; ∆
G
can therefore be calculated by the following formula:
$$\Delta G({{U}},{\mathrm{pH}},{{p}} = 1{\mathrm{bar}},{{T}} = 298\,{\mathrm{K}}) = \Delta G_0({{U}} = 0,{\mathrm{pH}} = 0,{{p}} = 1{\mathrm{bar}},{{T}} = 298\,{\mathrm{K}}) + \Delta G_{{\mathrm{pH}}} + \Delta G_{{U}}$$
where ∆
G
pH
is the correction of pH different from 0, which can be calculated by ∆
G
pH

k
B
T
ln × (pH), and ∆
G
U
is the correction of a bias on all states involving an electron in the electrode. ∆
G
U
can be obtained by ∆
G
U
= –e
U
, where
U
is the electrode potential relative to the standard hydrogen electrode.
In addition, we can calculate the ∆
G

(
U
= 0, pH = 0,
p
= 1 bar,
T
= 298 K) using the following formula:
$$\Delta G = \Delta H-{{T}}\Delta {{S}} = \Delta E + \Delta E_{{\mathrm{ZPE}}} + \Delta \Delta H_{(0 \to 298{\mathrm{K}})}-{{T}}\Delta {{S}}$$
where ∆
H
is the reaction enthalpy of an elementary step in FAOR, which approximately equals the DFT total energy (∆
E
) after zero-point energy correction (Δ
E
ZPE
);
T
∆S is the change in entropy contribution to the Gibbs free energy. For adsorbed species, ∆
H
at 0 K, 0 bar is a good approximation to ∆
G
, as the
S
contributions are small. However, for gaseous or liquid molecules such as formic acid, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water, we must consider the large entropy term at elevated temperatures.
