Synthesis of atomically nickel-dispersed graphene catalysts In a typical synthesis of atomically nickel-dispersed nitrogenated graphene catalyst (A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG), a mixture of melamine (C 3 H 6 N 6 ) (12 g), l -alanine (C 3 H 7 NO 2 ) (2.25 g) or l -cysteine (C 3 H 7 NO 2 S) (3 g) and nickel( ii ) acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH 3 COO) 2 · 4 H 2 O) (0.2 g) was first ground into a homogeneous precursor using zirconia ball in a nylon jar. Subsequently, the fine powder mixture underwent a two-stage pyrolysis and carbonization process (first stage: from 25 to 600 °C at a ramping rate of 3 °C min –1 , maintain at 600 °C for 2 h; second stage: from 600 to 900 °C at a ramping rate of 2 °C min –1 , maintain at 900 °C for 1 h) in a tubular furnace (Carbolite, UK) in argon atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was successively leached at 80 °C in 1 M HCl for 12 h and 1 M HNO 3 for another 24 h to remove metal particles and unstable species. Afterwards, the sample was heated again at 850 °C in Ar for 1 h to recover the crystallinity of carbon. Nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) was prepared by pyrolyzing a mixture of graphene oxide (100 mg) and melamine (500 mg) at 1,000 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace under argon atmosphere. To prepare metallic Ni-nanoparticle-decorated nitrogen-doped graphene (Ni-NG), 100 mg of graphene oxide was first dispersed in 30 ml of deionized (DI) water by ultrasonication, followed by addition of 2.5 mg of nickel( ii ) acetate tetrahydrate. The mixture was kept stirred over a water bath at 80 °C for 2 h, then freeze dried for 24 h to remove DI water. Subsequently, the dried product was ground with 500 mg of melamine into a homogeneous mixture, followed by a pyrolysis process at 900 °C for 2 h in argon atmosphere. The Ni-NG was obtained by cooling to room temperature.
