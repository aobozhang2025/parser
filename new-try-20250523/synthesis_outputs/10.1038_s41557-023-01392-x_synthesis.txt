catalyst was synthesized according to the Fridman method

. Briefly, the desired amounts of CrO

Catalytic testing
The catalysts were tested in a quartz fixed-bed reactor (8 mm inner diameter and 24 cm length) under atmospheric pressure. A mixture (1 ml) of 30–200 mg catalyst and quartz sand (20–40 mesh size) was loaded into the tubular quartz reactor. The catalysts were first heated to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min

in N

(50 ml min

). Afterwards, a mixture of C

H

, H

and N

was fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 50 ml min

. The inlet concentrations of C

H

and/or H

were varied from 0 to 40 vol% by changing the flow rate of C

H

, H

and N

while keeping the total flow rate constant. For the pre-reduction, after heating to 600 °C, the catalysts were treated in 42 vol% H

/N

(50 ml min

) for 1 h and then purged in N

(50 ml min

) for another 1 h. The gas products were analysed in an online gas chromatograph (GC-2060, Shanghai Ruimin Instrument Co. Ltd.) equipped with a flame ionization detector (Al

$$r\left({\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{6}\right)=\frac{F_{{\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{6}}^{\;\text{out}}}{m_{\text{cat}}}$$

$${k}_{{\rm{d}}}=\frac{\mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{1-{X}_{{\rm{Final}}}}{{X}_{{\rm{Final}}}}\right)-\,\mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{1-{X}_{{\rm{Initial}}}}{{X}_{{\rm{Initial}}}}\right)}{\tau }$$

where
