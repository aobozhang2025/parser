Methods Synthesis The materials used for the synthesis of the catalysts are listed in Supplementary Section 1 . The Ga 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 , Ga 2 O 3 –Ir/Al 2 O 3 and Ga 2 O 3 –Ir–K/Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. Using Ga 2 O 3 –Ir–K/Al 2 O 3 as an example, Ga(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O, IrCl 3 ·3H 2 O and KNO 3 were used as precursors and dissolved in deionized water. A γ-Al 2 O 3 support was impregnated with this solution at room temperature for 12 h, followed by drying at 100 °C overnight and calcination at 600 °C for 4 h. The Ga, Ir and K loadings were ∼ 3, ∼ 0.05 and ∼ 0.25 wt%, respectively. A commercial CrO x –K/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was synthesized according to the Fridman method 52 . Briefly, the desired amounts of CrO 3 and KOH were separately dissolved in water. Then, the two solutions were mixed. Afterwards, γ-Al 2 O 3 was added to the mixture. The catalyst was collected after drying and calcination at 760 °C for 4 h. The Cr and K loadings were ∼ 19.8 and ∼ 0.98 wt%, respectively. The loadings of M (M = Ga, Cr) were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), based on the weight ratio of M to Al 2 O 3 . Catalytic testing The catalysts were tested in a quartz fixed-bed reactor (8 mm inner diameter and 24 cm length) under atmospheric pressure. A mixture (1 ml) of 30–200 mg catalyst and quartz sand (20–40 mesh size) was loaded into the tubular quartz reactor. The catalysts were first heated to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min −1 in N 2 (50 ml min −1 ). Afterwards, a mixture of C 3 H 8 , H 2 and N 2 was fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 50 ml min −1 . The inlet concentrations of C 3 H 8 and/or H 2 were varied from 0 to 40 vol% by changing the flow rate of C 3 H 8 , H 2 and N 2 while keeping the total flow rate constant. For the pre-reduction, after heating to 600 °C, the catalysts were treated in 42 vol% H 2 /N 2 (50 ml min −1 ) for 1 h and then purged in N 2 (50 ml min −1 ) for another 1 h. The gas products were analysed in an online gas chromatograph (GC-2060, Shanghai Ruimin Instrument Co. Ltd.) equipped with a flame ionization detector (Al 2 O 3 plot column) and a thermal conductivity detector (TDX-01 column). The conversion of C 3 H 8 ( X (C 3 H 8 )), selectivity for C 3 H 6 , CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 4 ( S ( i )) and coke ( S (coke)), and C 3 H 6 formation rate ( r (C 3 H 6 )) were calculated using equations ( 1 )–( 4 ), respectively: $$X\left({\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{8}\right)=\frac{F_i^{\;\text{in}}-F_i^{\;\text{out}}}{F_i^{\;\text{in}}}$$ $$S\left(i\right)=\frac{n_i}{n_{{\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{8}}}\frac{F_i^{\;\text{out}}}{F_{{\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{8}}^{\;\text{in}}-F_{{\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{8}}^{\;\text{out}}}$$ $$S\left(\text{coke}\right)=1-{\sum }_iS(i)$$ $$r\left({\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{6}\right)=\frac{F_{{\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{6}}^{\;\text{out}}}{m_{\text{cat}}}$$ where \({F}_{i}^{\;{\rm{in}}}\) and \({F}_{i}^{\;{\rm{out}}}\) are the rates of flow of gas-phase components at the reactor inlet and outlet (mmol min −1 ), respectively, m cat is the mass of the catalyst, and \(n_{\mathrm{C}_3\mathrm{H}_8}\) and n i are the numbers of carbon atoms in propane and the product i (CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 4 and C 3 H 6 ), respectively. A first-order deactivation model was used to evaluate the catalyst stability: $${k}_{{\rm{d}}}=\frac{\mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{1-{X}_{{\rm{Final}}}}{{X}_{{\rm{Final}}}}\right)-\,\mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{1-{X}_{{\rm{Initial}}}}{{X}_{{\rm{Initial}}}}\right)}{\tau }$$ where X Initial and X Final are the conversions of C 3 H 8 measured in the initial and final stages of the reaction, respectively, τ is the reaction time (h) and k d is the deactivation rate constant (h −1 ). High k d values indicate rapid deactivation, that is, low stability.
