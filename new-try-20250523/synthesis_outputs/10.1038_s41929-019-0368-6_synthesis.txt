synthesis of the Ru/TiO 2 catalyst, RuCl 3 (0.03 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (3 ml). The mixture was stirred for 1 h and then added dropwise to TiO 2 (0.24 g). In the wet-impregnation method for preparing the catalyst, the water volume used was larger than that needed to saturate the TiO 2 surface, so a suspension liquid (Supplementary ) rather than a glue-like sample was formed. The formation of the suspension liquid allowed the mixtures to be stirred vigorously for 2 h and then the sample was dried overnight in an oven at 120 °C and subsequently reduced in H 2 at a flow rate of 20 ml min –1 and a heating rate of 2 °C min –1 to 400 °C, with the target temperature held for 3 h. The sample was subsequently cooled to room temperature and protected under N 2 for 1 h prior to removal from the tube reactor for the catalytic reactions or other tests. The other ruthenium catalysts, including Ru/Al 2 O 3 and Ru/ZrO 2 , were synthesized according to similar recipes, except the support. RuCl 3 , Ru/C, TiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy An aberration-corrected JEOL ARM300 CF microscope operated at 300 kV in STEM mode was used for
