Catalyst synthesis
Electrocatalysis
Abstract
Single-atom catalysts exhibit intriguing properties and receive widespread interest for their effectiveness in promoting a variety of catalytic reactions, making them highly desired motifs in materials science. However, common approaches to the synthesis of these materials often require tedious procedures and lack appropriate interactions between the metal atoms and supports. Here, we report a simple and practical strategy to access the large-scale synthesis of single-atom catalysts via direct atoms emitting from bulk metals, and the subsequent trapping on nitrogen-rich porous carbon with the assistance of ammonia. First, the ammonia coordinates with the copper atoms to form volatile Cu(NH

)
x
species based on the strong Lewis acid–base interaction. Then, following transportation under an ammonia atmosphere, the Cu(NH

)
x
species are trapped by the defects on the nitrogen-rich carbon support, forming the isolated copper sites. This strategy is readily scalable and has been confirmed as feasible for producing functional single-atom catalysts at industrial levels.

Article

Methods
Chemicals
All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification, except copper foam. The copper, nickel and cobalt foams were washed with dilute HCl, distilled water and acetone, and dried in a vacuum at 353 K before use. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO

)

·6H

O), 2-methylimidazole and copper foam were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent. The commercial Pt/C catalyst contains ~3 nm platinum nanoparticles with 20wt%.

Synthesis of ZIF-8
Following a typical procedure, 0.558 g Zn(NO

)

·6H

O was dissolved in 20 ml methanol and subsequently added to 20 ml methanol containing 0.616 g 2-methylimidazole under ultrasound for 10 min at room temperature. The ZIF-8 was then grown under static at 308 K for 12 h. The precipitates were centrifuged, washed with methanol and dried in a vacuum at 338 K for overnight.

Synthesis of Cu-SAs/N-C
Following a normal procedure, the copper foam and powder of ZIF-8 (100 mg) were separately placed on a porcelain boat. The porcelain boat was heated in a tube furnace to 1,173 K (at 5 K min
−1
) in a stream of argon (10 ml min
−1
) for 1 h and then NH

(10 ml min
−1
) for 1 h to yield Cu-SAs/N-C. The yield of Cu-SAs/N-C was about 26 mg. The detailed scale-up process is shown in the
Supplementary Video
. The copper content was measured as 0.54 wt% based on ICP-AES analysis. For comparison, the copper foam and ZIF-8 were separately placed on the porcelain boat and heated to 1,173 K (at 5 K min
−1
) in a stream of argon (10 ml min
−1
) for 2 h to yield pyrolysed ZIF-8. Syntheses of Ni-SAs/N-C and Co-SAs/N-C were the same as for Cu-SAs/N-C, but using nickel foam or cobalt foam, respectively. Cu-NPs/N-C was prepared by extending the evaporation time to 5 h.

Synthesis of Cu-SAs/N-G
Copper foam and fluffy graphene oxide powder (50 mg) were placed separately on a porcelain boat and heated to 1,073 K (at 5 K min
−1
) for 1 h in a stream of NH

(10 ml min
−1
) to yield Cu-SAs/N-G. The copper content was measured as 1.26 wt% based on ICP-AES analysis.
Material characterizations
A Rigaku MiniFlex600 was used to measure powder X-ray diffraction patterns. TEM was performed using a Hitachi HT7700. High-resolution TEM testing was carried out using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN. HAADF-STEM images and corresponding EELS were obtained on a JEOL JEM-ARM200F TEM/STEM system. XPS was performed using Al Kα radiation (PHI 5000 Verasa, ULAC-PHI). For the core-level spectra, the carbon 1
s
feature located at 285.0 eV was used to calibrate the binding energies. Elemental analysis of copper in the solid samples was detected by ICP-AES (Optima 7300 DV). XAFS spectra at the copper K edge were collected at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (beamline 1W1B station) in China.
Electrochemical measurements for ORR
The samples (Cu-SAs/N-G, Cu-SAs/N-C, Co-SAs/N-C and 20 wt% Pt/C) were fabricated by mixing catalyst powder (4 mg) with a mixture (480 μl ethanol, 480 μl H

O and 40 μl 5% Nafion solution (Sigma–Aldrich)) under ultrasonic conditions for 20 min. In 0.1 M KOH solution, the loadings of non-precious catalyst and Pt/C were 90 and 102 μg cm
−2
, respectively. A three-electrode system was used to conduct the electrochemical measurements on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E). A glassy carbon rotating-disk electrode (RDE) of 5 mm in diameter coated with the catalyst ink served as the working electrode. Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. A graphite rod was used as the counter electrode to avoid any possible pollution of platinum. All potential values were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)

, as shown in Supplementary 
. All current densities were corrected for the ohmic drop (that is, the iR drop) according to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results (Supplementary 
)

.
Before the measurement, a stream of N

/O

flow was delivered to the electrolyte for 30 min to obtain an N

/O

-saturated solution. The net ORR curves were obtained by subtracting the background capacitance from those recorded with O

-saturated KOH. The background capacitance was recorded with the same potential range and scan rate, but in the N

-saturated KOH. TOFs of the Pt/C and Cu-SAs/N-C were calculated based on the mole number of active platinum atoms and copper single sites, respectively. The TOF values were obtained based on the equation:
$${\mathrm{TOF}} = \frac{{J \times a}}{{4 \times m \times F}}$$

where
J
represents the current density measured at 0.9 V,
a
is the surface area of the glassy carbon disk electrode (0.196 cm

), 4 is the number of electrons transferred during O

reduction,
m
is the mole number of active platinum atoms or copper single sites on the electrode, and
F
is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol
−1
).
The RDE measurement was performed at a sweep rate of 10 mV s
−1
with different rotating speeds (900 to 2,500 r.p.m.). The electron transfer number (
n
) and kinetic current density (
J
k
) were obtained according to the Koutecky–Levich equation:
$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{{J_{{\rm{l}}}}} + \frac{1}{{J_{{\rm{k}}}}} = \frac{1}{{B\omega ^{\frac{1}{2}}}} + \frac{1}{{J_{{\rm{k}}}}}$$

$${B} = 0.62nFC_{\mathrm{0}}D_{\mathrm{0}}^{\frac{2}{3}}V^{ - \frac{1}{6}}$$

where
J
is the current density measured from the ORR,
J
k
is the kinetic current density,
J
l
is the limiting current density,
ω
represents the angular velocity of the disk,
C

is the bulk concentration of O

(1.2 × 10
−6
mol cm
−3
),
D

is the diffusion coefficient of O

in 0.1 M KOH (1.9 × 10
−5
cm

s
−1
) and
V
is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01 cm

s
−1
). The accelerated durability tests of Cu-SAs/N-C and Pt/C were performed by applying potential cycling between 1.0 and 0.6 V versus RHE for 5,000 cycles (O

-saturated 0.1 M KOH, 50 mv s
−1
, room temperature).
For the RRDE tests, the disk electrode was scanned negatively (10 mV s
−1
). Meanwhile, a high potential (1.20 V versus RHE) was applied on the ring electrode, leading to the electro-oxidation of H

O

, which occured during the oxygen reduction process. The hydrogen peroxide yield (H

O

(%)) and electron transfer number (
n
) were calculated based on the following equations:
$${\mathrm{H}}_2{\mathrm{O}}_2\,\left( {\mathrm{\% }} \right) = 200 \times \frac{{\frac{{{I}_{\mathrm{r}}}}{{N}}}}{{{I}_{\mathrm{d}} + \frac{{{I}_{\mathrm{r}}}}{{N}}}}$$

$${n} = 4 \times \frac{{{I}_{\mathrm{d}}}}{{{I}_{\mathrm{d}} + \frac{{{I}_{r}}}{{N}}}}$$

where
I
d
is the disk current,
I
r
is the ring current and
N
= 0.4 is the current collection efficiency of the platinum ring.
