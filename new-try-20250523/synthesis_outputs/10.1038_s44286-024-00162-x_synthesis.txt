was reported previously

. SiO

powder (360 mg) was sonicated in 100 ml deionized water to produce a nearly homogeneous slurry. Then, 0.4 mmol Ce(NO

)

∙6H

O was added and dissolved in the solution, followed by the rapid injection of 0.8 ml NH

∙H

O (2M) under stirring for 3 min before vacuum filtration. The resulting solid particles were separated and air-dried overnight at room temperature. The dried powders were ground into finer particles and subsequently calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C (with an initial temperature ramp of 5 °C min

) for 12 h.

in 120 ml deionized water

. The pH value of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 51 μmol H

and 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. With the slurry magnetically stirred for 5 h, the platinum-containing precursor solution was slowly added into the CeO

slurry. After stirring for another 2 h, the mixture was separated by vacuum filtration to give platinum-containing solid particles, which were then washed several times with deionized water. The resultant powder was calcined at 600 °C for 12 h to form the as-synthesized catalyst. Pt/CeO

XAS
XAS was performed at beamlines 4-1 and 15-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. Conventional data were collected at beamline 4-1; this is a side station on a 20-pole wiggler beamline. The ring (SPEAR3) was operated in the top-off mode; the storage ring energy was 3 GeV and the stored current was 500 mA. To minimize harmonics at the platinum L

edge, the double-crystal Si monochromator was detuned by 20%–30% of the maximum intensity. Ex situ spectra were collected in the fluorescence yield mode with a 30-element germanium solid-state detector array. The samples were pressed into pellets and mounted on a plate, and the data were recorded at room temperature. In operando XAS experiments were done with approximately 40 mg samples loaded in a tubular flow-through quartz cell (inside diameter, 2.8 mm) through which the treatment gases flowed

.
HERFD-XANES experiments were performed at beamline 15-2, which is equipped with a 56-pole, 0.9 T wiggler and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled double-crystal Si monochromator for selection of the incident-beam energy. A Rowland circle spectrometer having a radius of 1 m and equipped with three spherically bent Si analyzers and a silicon drift detector were used to select the platinum L
α
emission line

. In each HERFD-XANES experiment, an approximately 40 mg sample was loaded in the flow-through cell that was fed with the treatment gas.
ATHENA and ARTEMIS software

were used to analyze the EXAFS data. Data alignment, edge calibration, deglitching, normalization and background subtraction were performed with ATHENA. The platinum L

edge energy was determined by the first inflection point of the absorption edge data characterizing a platinum-foil reference, calibrated to the reported energy of 11,564.0 eV. Data fitting was performed considering
k

,
k

and
k

weightings. The fitting ranges in
k
space and
R
space in the data analysis for each sample were determined by the data quality. These values were used with the Nyquist theorem for the estimation of the justified number of fitting parameters, which was not exceeded in the reported fits. The amplitude reduction factor,
S

, was determined by fitting the experimental platinum-foil data, and then fixed for further analysis of the data characterizing the various samples (Supplementary 
and Supplementary 
). The parameters characterizing the local structure environment including the CN, scattering path distance between the absorber and backscattering atoms (
R
), mean square relative displacement (Δ
σ

, disorder term) and inner potential correction (Δ
E

) were allowed to vary in the fitting. Various plausible models were considered in the fitting. The quality of fit was determined by the minimization of the R factor.
Standard procedures were used in the analysis of the XANES data

.
STEM
HAADF-STEM imaging was performed with an aberration-corrected JEOL ARM-200F microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and an image resolution of 0.08 nm in the HAADF imaging mode and, separately, with a double-aberration-corrected Themis Z microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV and an image resolution of 0.06 nm. The catalyst powders were loaded on lacey-carbon-coated copper transmission electron microscopy grids, and low electron probe currents were used to reduce the electron-beam-induced effects.
Infrared spectroscopy
A Bruker IFS 66v spectrometer (equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT) detector) and a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT-A) detector) were used to collect the DRIFTS data characterizing the powder samples. The spectral resolution was 4 cm
−1
. The cell was partly filled with approximately 50 mg of inert KBr powder, followed by adding approximately 10 mg of catalyst packed onto the KBr. The cell was connected into a flow system that allowed the recording of spectra as the reactant gases (CO (10% in helium, Airgas), helium (Praxair, UHP grade),

CO (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 99.5%), ethylene (Airgas, UHP grade) and/or H

(Airgas, UHP grade)) flowed through the cell at the desired temperature. The background spectra were recorded at room temperature for the as-synthesized Pt/CeO

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
The platinum loading of each catalyst sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, performed using a Thermo Scientific XSERIES 2 instrument.
XPS measurements
The XPS measurements were performed with a K-Alpha Plus XPS/UPS analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1,486.6 eV) with the samples placed in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber. The system reached a stable pressure, typically in the mid 10
−10
torr range, after ~12 h without the sample, or in the 10
−8
torr range with the sample present. Samples were mounted on conductive silver tape. A vacuum transfer module was used to transfer samples directly from a glove box to the XPS chamber without air exposure. A flood gun was used during the measurements to dynamically compensate for sample charging. A step size of 0.1 eV and a pass energy of 50 eV were used for each spectrum. The spectra were calibrated by setting the Si 2
p
signal of SiO

to 103.4 eV (
). CasaXPS software version 2.3.25 was used for further data calibration and processing.
XRD crystallography
XRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a Philips X’Pert Pro Super diffractometer, equipped with a monochromatized Cu Kα radiation source at a wavelength of 0.1542 nm.
Ethylene hydrogenation catalysis in a conventional flow reactor
Ethylene hydrogenation catalysis experiments were done with a once-through temperature-controlled tubular plug-flow reactor (inside diameter, 4 mm) at various temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The products were analyzed with an online Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 50 m × 0.53 mm PLOT Alumina ‘M’ capillary column. Samples of the catalyst (Pt/CeO

-RED) powder (12 mg) mixed with 500 mg of inert non-porous α-Al

O

particles were loaded into the reactor, with the upstream and downstream sections packed with quartz wool. The catalyst masses were 12 mg and 6 mg for 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO
x

. The values of near-steady-state TOF were determined directly from the conversions of ethylene, which were <5.0% and shown to be differential

. After each catalyst reached steady-state operation, no substantial deactivation was observed at longer times on stream (176 h). Thereafter, the catalytic reaction experiments were carried out at various temperatures with the same feed gas to provide near-steady-state conversions at various temperatures. Each reported catalytic reaction rate (TOF) at each temperature is based on data from approximately 8 h of near-steady-state operation.

at room temperature and heated and held at 260 °C for 6 h. The gas phase and products dissolved in
n
