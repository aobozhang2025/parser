Preparation of PVP-free Pd-NPs supported on ZIF-8-derived N-doped carbon (Pd-NPs/CN)
First, ZIF-8-derived N-doped carbon (CN) was obtained by pyrolysing ZIF-8 powder at 900 °C for 3 h under inert atmosphere. Then, the PVP-protected Pd-NPs methanol solution (~1 mg

, containing 1.6 mg Pd) was mixed with CN and stirred for 1 h. The mixture was vacuum dried to evaporate the solvent. The obtained Pd-NPs/CN was then heated in air at 400 °C for 2 h to remove PVP as guided by a reported procedure

. The PVP-free Pd-NPs/CN were reduced in 5% H

/Ar at 200 °C for 1 h before catalytic test.
Characterization
We investigated the crystalline structure and phase purity by Rigaku RU-200b XRD with CuKα radiation (
λ
= 1.5418 Å). We measured the metal concentration of the metal-SAs by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). XPS experiments were performed on a ULVAC PHI Quantera microprobe and the Photoemission Endstation at the BL10B beamline in the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in Hefei, China. Binding energies (BE) were calibrated by setting the measured BE of C 1
s
to 284.8 eV. We analysed the catalysts’ sizes and morphologies by a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope (TEM) and collected the elemental maps by JEOL JEM-2100F field emission electron microscope. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy characterizations were performed using a probe aberration corrected microscope JEOL JEM-ARM200CF microscope, with 25 mrad incident beam and collection angle between 90 mrad and 370 mrad for HAADF acquisition. The size of HAADF-STEM images was 1,024 × 1,024 with 5 μs dwell time of each pixel. The probe current was 100 pA and probe size 0.78 Å, so the electron dose rate was approximately 6.54 × 10

electrons per Å

, which was sufficiently low for TEM mode and to not cause beam damage.
In situ environmental microscopic study
The in situ environmental microscopic study is performed on a Titan ETEM microscope (FEI) operated at 300 kV equipped with an image Cs-corrector. The sampling nanoparticles are diluted in isopropanol and dispersed with ultrasonic. Then the solution is cast on a MEMS in situ heating chip, blow dried with dry air and mounted on a functional TEM holder (DENSsolutions, wildfire). To avoid cross pollution, both the chip and the sample holder were plasma cleaned by 30 min. After casting, the chip and the holder were again cleaned by UV for 5 min under 35 mbar vacuum to remove the residual organics. The gaseous environment was created inside the ETEM column with pure Ar (99.9995%) and heated by the MEMS heater integrated on the chip. To reduce the irradiation effect, several NPs were tested under different beam doses. We found that above a dose of 1.16 e Å

S

the structure of the CN could be slightly undermined, because of which all in situ results were acquired below this dose. Moreover, to minimize the dose effect, apart from data requiring time (~0.3–0.5 sec per time), the beam was always blanked during stages including the gas injection, temperature ramping and so on.
XAFS measurements and data processing
We collected XAFS spectra at the BL14W1 station of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, operated at 3.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA, Pd K-edge and Au L

-edge) and the 1W1B station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF, operated at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA, Pt L

-edge), respectively. We collected the XAFS data of metal-NPs and metal-SAs samples in fluorescence mode. We pelletized all samples as disks of 13 mm diameter with 1 mm thickness by using graphite powder as binder for metal-NP samples and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) powder as binder for metal-SA samples. All spectra were collected in ambient conditions.
We processed the acquired EXAFS data according to the standard procedures by using the ATHENA module of the IFEFFIT software packages. We obtained the EXAFS spectra by post-edge background subtraction from the overall absorption and normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step. Then,
χ
(
k
) data were Fourier transformed to real (
R
) space by utilization of a Hanning window (d
k
= 1.0 Å
–1
) for separating the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. Least-squares curve parameter fitting was carried out by utilizing the ARTEMIS module of the IFEFFIT software packages to obtain the quantitative structural parameters around central atoms

.
The following EXAFS equation was used:
$$\chi \left( k \right) = \mathop {\sum}\limits_j {\frac{{\mathop {N}\nolimits_j \mathop {S}\nolimits_0^2 \mathop {F}\nolimits_j \left( k \right)}}{{k\mathop {R}\nolimits_j^2 }}} \exp \left[ { - 2\mathop {k}\nolimits^2 \mathop {\sigma }\nolimits_j^2 } \right]\exp \left[ {\frac{{ - 2\mathop {R}\nolimits_j }}{{\lambda \left( k \right)}}} \right]\sin \left[ {2k\mathop {R}\nolimits_j + \mathop {\varphi }\nolimits_j \left( k \right)} \right]$$

Catalytic evaluation
We investigated the catalytic performances of the samples by a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz-glass microreactor (i.d. = 6 mm). The Pd-SAs catalyst containing 1.6 mg palladium (determined by ICP-OES measurement) was mixed with 2.0 g quarters sands (40–60 mesh).

and balanced helium was passed through the catalyst bed. The total flow rate was 20 ml min

. We analysed the reactants and products by gas chromatography (GC), using a PLOT-Al

capillary column (50 m, 0.25 mm) which was connected to flame ionization detector to analyse hydrocarbons, Poropak-Q and RT-Msieve 5A columns which were connected to a thermal conductivity detector to analyse hydrocarbons and other permanent gases. The catalytic performances of Pd/CN-600, Pd/CN-700 and Pd/CN-800 were detected under the same conditions.
We calculated acetylene conversion and ethylene selectivity as follow:
$${\mathrm{Conversion}} = \frac{{C}_{{{\mathrm{feed}}} - C_x}}{{C_{\mathrm{feed}}}} \times 100$$

$${\mathrm{Selectivity}} = \frac{{C_{{\mathrm{feed}}} - C_x}}{{C}_{\mathrm{feed} - C_x + C_{{\mathrm{ethane}}} + 2 \times C_{\mathrm{C}_4{\mathrm{H}}_x}}} \times 100$$

hydrocarbons in the same way. No higher hydrocarbons than C

were detected in the experiments because of the short contact time and higher H

partial pressure.
