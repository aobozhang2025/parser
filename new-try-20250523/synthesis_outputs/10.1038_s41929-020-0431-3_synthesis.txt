Abstract
The worldwide replacement of the toxic mercuric chloride catalyst in vinyl chloride manufacture via acetylene hydrochlorination is slowed by the limited durability of alternative catalytic systems at high space velocities. Here, we demonstrate that platinum single atoms on carbon carriers are substantially more stable (up to 1,073 K) than their gold counterparts (up to 473 K), enabling facile and scalable preparation and precise tuning of their coordination environment by simple temperature control. By combining kinetic analysis, advanced characterization, and density functional theory, we assess how the Pt species determines the catalytic performance and thereby identify Pt(
ii
)−Cl as the active site, being three times more active than Pt nanoparticles. We show that Pt single atoms exhibit outstanding stability in acetylene hydrochlorination and surpass the space–time yields of their gold-based analogues after 25 h time-on-stream, qualifying them as a candidate for sustainable vinyl chloride production.

Catalyst synthesis
The NC support was prepared via a two-step synthesis, comprising the oxidative polymerization of aniline and a subsequent carbonization step

. Aniline (50 mmol, Acros, 99.5%) was dissolved in deionized water (40 cm

, pH 0.4; adjusted by hydrochloric acid, 1.25 M, Sigma-Aldrich, >37%), cooled to 277 K and subsequently added to a precooled solution (277 K) of ammonium persulfate (100 mmol, Acros, 98%) in deionized water (20 cm

) under vigorous stirring, using a magnetic stirring bar. Subsequently, the polyaniline slurry was kept for 24 h at room temperature without stirring, followed by filtering and washing with water (~0.75 l g
−1
). The formed polyaniline was dried in static air at 393 K for 12 h and carbonized at 1,073 K in N

atmosphere for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 K min

. The obtained NC was ground and sieved into particles with a size of 0.4–0.6 mm. Commercial AC (Norit ROX 0.8) was immersed in aqua regia at room temperature to remove metal impurities. After filtration and thorough washing with deionized water (2 l g
−1
), the material was dried in static air at 393 K for 12 h and subsequently ground and sieved into particles with a size of 0.4–0.6 mm. All metal-based catalysts were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method (nominal metal loading of 1 wt%). Accordingly, a solution of the respective metal precursor, H

Catalyst characterization
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was conducted using a Horiba Ultra 2 instrument equipped with photomultiplier tube detection. The solids were dissolved in a 3:1 mixture of HNO

and H

O

under sonication until no solids were visible. Elemental analysis of C, H and N was determined by infrared spectroscopy using a LECO TruSpec Micro combustion furnace. XRD was measured using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO-MPD diffractometer with Cu-K
α
radiation (
λ
= 1.54060 Å). The data was recorded in the 10–70° 2
θ
range with an angular step size of 0.017° and a counting time of 0.26 s per step. Argon sorption was measured at 77 K in a Micromeritics 3Flex instrument, after evacuation of the samples at 423 K for 12 h. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Linseis STA PT1600 system coupled to a Pfeiffer Vacuum Thermo-Star GSD 320 T1 mass spectrometer. TGA of the as-prepared catalysts and after use in acetylene hydrochlorination was carried out in diluted oxygen (20% O

min

), heating the samples (amount fixed to 20 mg) from 298 to 1,273 K at 10 K min

to quantify the amount of coke deposits in the used catalysts. Temperature-programmed desorption of acetylene (C

H

-TPD) was performed in a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 unit equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320 O mass spectrometer. The sample (amount fixed to 100 mg) was loaded into a U-shaped quartz micro-reactor, pre-dried in He (

by MS. STEM data with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector were acquired on a HD2700CS (Hitachi) microscope operated at 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dipping the copper grid supporting a holey carbon foil in a suspension of the solid in ethanol and drying in air. XPS data were acquired on a Physical Electronics Quantum 2000 instrument using monochromatic Al-K
α
radiation, generated from an electron beam operated at 15 kV, and equipped with a hemispherical capacitor electron-energy analyser. The samples were analysed at an electron take-off angle of 45° and a constant analyser pass energy of 46.95 eV with a spectra resolution step width of 0.2 eV. The spectrometer was calibrated for the Au 4
f
7/2
signal at 84.0 ± 0.1 eV. The elemental concentrations, given in 
, were quantified based on the measured photoelectron peak areas (C 1
s
, N 1
s
, O 1
s
, Cl 2
p
) using PHI-MultiPak software and the built-in relative sensitivity factors, which are corrected for the system transmission function. The Pt 4
f
and N 1
s
spectra were fitted by mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian component profiles after Shirley background subtraction (68–81 eV for Pt 4
f
spectra and 309–405 eV for N 1
s
spectra). The selected peak positions of the Pt
7/2
doublet peak are based on data reported in the literature (71.2 ± 0.1 eV for Pt, 72.4 ± 0.1 eV for Pt(
ii
) and 73.6 ± 0.1 eV for Pt in a higher oxidation state, tentatively assigned to Pt(
iv
) (refs.

,

). The areal ratio of Pt
7/2
to Pt
5/2
was fixed to 4:3 and the peak separation to 3.33 eV. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the two Pt
7/2
and Pt
5/2
doublet peaks was locked to obtain the same values for each single component. However, for different components the FWHM was not restricted, resulting in small variations in the FWHM (±0.25) for different doublet peaks. These small variations occur due to locally differing environments (that is, variations in the chemical bonding with the second or third neighbouring atom and local variations in the Fermi level for compounds having a band gap). The selected peak positions for the four different nitrogen species were fixed to 398.4 eV (N6), 400.4 eV (N5), 401.1 eV (N3) and 403.0 eV (N0) with an error of ±0.1 eV (
). The FWHM was not restricted, resulting in small variations (±0.25) for different peaks. The detailed fitting parameters, reported in the literature and used in this work, are given in Supplementary Tables

. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements at the Pt L

and L

edge were carried out at the SuperXAS beamline of the Swiss Light Source. The incident photon beam provided by a 2.9 T superbend magnet was selected by a Si channel-cut Quick-EXAFS monochromator. The rejection of higher harmonics and focusing were achieved with rhodium-coated collimating and toroidal mirrors, respectively, at 2.5 mrad. The beamline was calibrated using Pt foil. The area of sample illuminated by the X-ray beam was 0.5 mm × 0.2 mm. The Pt catalysts (300 mg) were finely ground, mixed homogeneously with five parts of cellulose and pressed into 13-mm-diameter pellets. Commercial H

(ACROS, 99.9%), PtO

(ABCR, 99.95%) and Pt(NH

(NO

)

(Sigma-Aldrich, 99.995%) were used as references. All spectra were recorded in transmission mode at room temperature. EXAFS spectra were acquired with a 1 Hz frequency (0.5 s per spectrum) and then averaged over 10 min. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were calibrated by measuring Pt foil simultaneously with each sample. The EXAFS spectra were analysed using the Demeter software package

. The background signal before the Pt L

edge was subtracted using a linear function (fitting range between –150 and –60 eV). The post edge signal was normalized to the step of one using a Victoreen function in the region between 150 and 1,300 eV after the edge. The background signal before the Pt L

edge was subtracted using a linear function (fitting range between –150 and –60 eV). The post edge signal was normalized to the step of one using a Victoreen function in the region between 100 and 600 eV after the edge. We fitted the k

-weighted Fourier-transformed signal and determined an amplitude reduction factor (
S

) of 0.83 from the EXAFS fit of the Pt metal foil. All EXAFS spectra were fitted for the first coordination shell in the k-range of 3.2–9.5 and 3.1–9.9 Å
−1
, for the L

and L

edges, respectively, and the
R
-range of 1.1–2.85 Å. To fit the Pt–Pt, Pt–Cl and Pt–N(O) scattering paths, Pt foil, H

PtCl

and PtO

were used as the references (Supplementary 
).
Catalyst testing
Steady-state hydrochlorination of acetylene was studied at atmospheric pressure in a continuous-flow fixed-bed micro-reactor (Supplementary 
)

. The gases C

H

(PanGas, purity 2.6), HCl (Air Liquide, purity 2.8, anhydrous), Ar (PanGas, purity 5.0, internal standard) and He (PanGas, purity 5.0, carrier gas) were fed using digital mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst) to the mixing unit, equipped with a pressure indicator. A quartz micro-reactor with a 10 mm inner diameter was loaded with the catalyst (
W
cat
= 0.1 g in initial catalytic activity tests and 0.25 g in stability tests, particle size 0.4–0.6 mm) and placed in a homemade electrical oven. A K-type thermocouple fixed in a coaxial quartz thermowell with the tip positioned in the centre of the catalyst bed was used to control the temperature during the reaction. Prior to testing, the catalyst was heated in a He flow to the desired temperature (
T

= 423–493 K) and allowed to stabilize for at least 30 min before the reaction mixture (40 vol.% C

) was fed at a total volumetric flow of

and C

H

Cl) and Ar were quantified on-line via a gas chromatograph equipped with a GS-Carbon PLOT column coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Agilent, GC 7890B, Agilent MSD 5977 A). Since VCM was the only product detected in all our tests, the catalytic activity is presented as
Y
(VCM), calculated according to equation (

),
$$Y{{\mathbf{(VCM)}}} = \frac{{n_{{{\mathbf{VCM}}}}^{{{\mathbf{outlet}}}}}}{{n_{{{\mathbf{C}}}_{\mathbf{2}}{{\mathbf{H}}}_{\mathbf{2}}}^{{{\mathbf{inlet}}}}}} \cdot 100$$

where
\(n_{{{\mathbf{VCM}}}}^{{{\mathbf{outlet}}}}\)
and
\(n_{{{\mathbf{C}}}_{\mathbf{2}}{{\mathbf{H}}}_{\mathbf{2}}}^{{{\mathbf{inlet}}}}\)
denote the respective molar flows of VCM and C

H

at the reactor outlet and inlet. The turnover frequency (TOF) and the STY of VCM were determined according to equations (

) and (

),
$$\mathrm{TOF} = \frac{{n_{{{\mathbf{C}}}_{\mathbf{2}}{{\mathbf{H}}}_{\mathbf{2}}}^{{{\mathbf{inlet}}}} - n_{{{\mathbf{C}}}_{\mathbf{2}}{{\mathbf{H}}}_{\mathbf{2}}}^{{{\mathbf{outlet}}}}}}{{n_{{{\mathbf{Pt}}}}}}$$

$$\mathrm{STY}{{\mathbf{(VCM)}}} = \frac{{n_{{{\mathbf{VCM}}}}^{{{\mathbf{outlet}}}}}}{{W_{{{\mathbf{cat}}}}}} \cdot M{{\mathbf{(VCM)}}}$$

where
M
(VCM) denotes the molecular weight of VCM. The error of the carbon balance,
ε
C
, determined using equation (

), was less than 5% in all experiments; that is, the carbon mass balance was closed at ≥95%.
$$\varepsilon _{{\mathbf{C}}} = \frac{{n_{{{\mathbf{C}}}_{\mathbf{2}}{{\mathbf{H}}}_{\mathbf{2}}}^{{{\mathbf{inlet}}}} - \left( {n_{{{\mathbf{C}}}_{\mathbf{2}}{{\mathbf{H}}}_{\mathbf{2}}}^{{{\mathbf{outlet}}}} + n_{{{\mathbf{VCM}}}}^{{{\mathbf{outlet}}}}} \right)}}{{n_{{{\mathbf{C}}}_{\mathbf{2}}{{\mathbf{H}}}_{\mathbf{2}}}^{{{\mathbf{inlet}}}}}} \cdot 100$$

After the tests, the reactor was quenched to room temperature in a He flow and the catalyst was retrieved for further characterization. All catalytic data points were determined as an average of at least two measurements. The evaluation of the dimensionless moduli based on the criteria of Carberry, Mears, and Weisz–Prater confirmed that all the catalytic tests were performed in the absence of mass and heat transfer limitations (see Supplementary 
and
Supplementary Discussion
). The deactivation constants,
k
D
, were derived via a simple linear regression of the initial t.o.s performances of selected platinum- and gold-based catalysts (linear regime). For clarity, the data ranges considered are indicated by the respective trend lines in Supplementary 
.
Computational methods
Spin polarized DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code

,

. The functional of choice was Perdew–Becke–Ernzerhof (PBE)

with dispersion contributions introduced through the D3 approach

,

. While non-valent electrons were described by projector augmented waves (PAW)

,

, the monoelectronic valence states were expanded as plane waves with a maximum kinetic energy of 450 eV. Graphitic carbon slabs were modelled using a 6 × 6 supercell with three layers of thickness. The metal surfaces were modelled using a 4 × 4 supercell in the orientation. For all systems, the top two layers of the slab were allowed to relax, and the slabs were separated by 12 Å of vacuum. The k-points sampling was a Γ–centred 3 × 3 × 1 grid (~0.3 Å
−1
). A dipole correction was employed along the
z
-direction normal to the slab faces

. The molecules were placed in a cubic box with sides of 15 Å. In all cases the optimization thresholds were 10
−5
and 10
−4
eV for electronic and ionic relaxations, respectively (VASP recommended and tested settings for graphitic materials). Transition states were located following the climbing image nudged elastic band procedure (CI-NEB)

. Transition states were confirmed by diagonalizing the numerical Hessian matrix obtained by displacements of ±0.02 Å. Simulated EXAFS spectra were generated using FEFF8 (
) and post-processed with Athena
