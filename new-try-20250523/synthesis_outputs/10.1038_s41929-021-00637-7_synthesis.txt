Synthesis of ZIF-8 A Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (5.58 g) in methanol was added to a solution of 2-methylimidazole (6.16 g) methanol in methanol with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 24 h. The precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed with methanol and dried under vacuum at 80 °C. Synthesis of ZIF-8/Ir@PZS ZIF-8/Ir@PZS, 4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol (800 mg) and phosphonitrilic chloride trimer (375 mg) were dissolved in 250 mL of methanol. The obtained powder of ZIF-8 (600 mg) was dispersed in 100 mL of methanol, followed by injection of 7.08 mL of a methanol solution of iridium (IV) chloride (1 mg/mL) into the dispersion of ZIF-8. Subsequently, the dispersion was added into the initial methanol solution followed by vigorous stirred. 3 mL of triethylamine was introduced dropwise into the above-resulting dispersion and the obtain dispersion was stirred for 15 h. The as-obtained precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed with methanol several times and finally dried in vacuum at 80 °C. Synthesis of Ir-SA The above-obtained powders of ZIF-8/Ir@PZS were placed in quartz boat and maintained at 950 °C for 3 h in a tube furnace with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 under a flow of argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the as-prepared samples of Ir-SA were collected and used without further treatment. Preparation of homogeneous catalyst Ir(ttp)COCl [Ir(COD)Cl]2 (100 mg, 0.149 mmol) and H2TTP (70 mg, 0.104 mmol) were added into 100 mL round bottom flask with 40 mL xylene inside, the mixture was refluxed for 3 days. After cooling, the crude reaction solution was dried under vacuum, and the residue was purified by column. The Ir complex was obtained as purple solid, which was further recrystallized with EA/Hexane to give crystalized pure product. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, Chloroform-d) δ p.p.m. 8.94 (s, 8H), 8.16 (ddd, J = 25.5, 8.6, 1.9 Hz, 8H), 7.58 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 8H), 2.72 (s, 12H).
