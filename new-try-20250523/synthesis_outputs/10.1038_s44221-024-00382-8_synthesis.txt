Kinetics fitting Kinetics of the pollutant degradation data was fitted by the first -order equation which is given as follows: ln(𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶0) =-kt Where, C t is the concentration of pollutants at t time (mg/L), C 0 is the original concentration of contaminants (mg/L), and k is the degradation rate constant (min-1). The apparent rate constant (kobs) is calculated based on the average concentration, and the standard deviation (SD) is determined by treating the kobs as the mean value for its calculation. Text S5.

Galvanic oxidation setup In order to validate the direct redox interaction between PMS and phenol on the surface of the catalyst, we undertook galvanic cell experiments using a two -chamber reactor setup. A carbon paper electrode (2 cm × 2 cm) was employed as the substrate for loading the catalyst. Initially, 10 mg of catalyst powder was combined with a mixture comprising 40 uL Nafion solution and 1 mL of isopropanol. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was subjected to 60 min of sonication to ensure formation of a homogeneous ink. A portion of the catalyst ink (0.2 m L) was then evenly applied to one side of the carbon paper and dried at room temperature. Within the galvanic cell system featuring two chambers, one cell was loaded with a solution containing 0.2 mM phenol and 50 mM Na 2SO 4 (as the electrolyte), while the other cell contained a solution of 50 mM Na 2SO 4. Upon initiating the reaction by injecting 0.4 mM PMS into the designated cell, the change in a current during the reaction was continuously monitored using an ammeter. Copper wires were used to connect the two electrodes and the ammeter. Samples were periodically extracted from the phenol -containing cell for subsequent analysis . Text S8. Byproduct analysis.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (V ASP)3,4. The electron -ion potential was described by the projected augmented wave method (PAW)5, and a plane -wave energy cut -off of 450 eV was set in this study. The Perdew -Burk -Ernzerhof (PBE) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to describe the exchange - correlation functional6. The convergence criterion of the force was -0.03 eV/Å and the convergence thresholds for the total energy was 10-5 eV . Since GGA cannot correctly describe strongly correlated systems containing partially filled d subshells, the GGA+U method is applied to describe partially filled d orbitals by taking into account Coulomb and exchange corrections. We used correlation e nergy (U) of 4 eV and exchange energy (J) of 1 eV for transition metal ™ d orbitals. The Brillouin -zone integration was approximated 4×4×1 by a grid using the Monkhorst -Pack k -point mesh. A vacuum space of 15 Å in the Z -direction was chosen to avoid arti ficial interaction. The effect of van der Waals (vdW) interactions was included for weak interaction cases using the semiempirical correction scheme of Becke -Jonson damping, DFT -D3 7. The adsorption energy of *PMS ( ΔE) on the catalyst surface was calculated by ΔE= E(*PMS) – E(slab) - E(PMS) in which E(*PMS), E(slab) and E(PMS) are the total energy of the catalyst slab with adsorbed PMS, the catalyst slab and the energy of PMS, respectively.
