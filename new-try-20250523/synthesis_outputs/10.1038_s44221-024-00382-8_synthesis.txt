The synthesis procedure of Co
CNCl/S is shown in 
. First, CoSO

, dicyandiamide, glucose and sodium chloride (NaCl) were dissolved in water and then freeze dried to encapsulate Co ions and other molecules within NaCl crystal lattice. Afterwards, the resulting mixture was annealed at 900 °C in an argon atmosphere, leading to the carbonization of glucose to form a graphene network between the salt lattice to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) Co-SAC nanosheets–NaCl mixture. Notably, the size of NaCl increased during the high-temperature carbonization process, thereby expediting the formation of interpenetrating nanosheets at the boundaries of salt particles and securing a high carbon yield due to the confined carbonization between NaCl terminals. At annealing temperatures above the melting point of NaCl (801 °C), molten NaCl facilitated the capture of Cl by Co atoms, introducing Cl into the Co centre. Simultaneously, the thermal decomposition of CoSO

released sulfur, which was spontaneously incorporated into the carbon matrix, creating long-range coordination with the Co single atoms. Following the removal of the NaCl template via acid washing (Supplementary 
), 3D honeycomb-like structures were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Co

CNCl/S indicated the 3D honeycomb-like morphologies with interconnected open pores

−1
). High resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) revealed that numerous isolated bright spots were dispersed on the matrix 
), demonstrating Co single atoms, which corroborates with the result from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; Supplementary 
). Moreover, S and Cl were successfully incorporated into the carbon matrix combined with isolated Co atoms, as demonstrated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; 
and Supplementary 
).

Controlled experiments were conducted to investigate the factors for catalyst synthesis with 3D honeycomb-like morphology and single-atomic structures. As results, a series of nitrogen (N)-doped, S-doped and N–S co-doped carbon-based catalysts without or with Co single sites were synthesized by varying the added precursors of heteroatoms and Co salts (correspondingly denoted as CN, C/S, CN/S and Co

CNCl; Supplementary Figs.

–

). Notably, the catalysts using the NaCl template for synthesis revealed 3D interconnected porous structures with a high Co content (2.09–2.66 wt.%), whereas the reference sample without NaCl (Co

CN/S-w/o NaCl) exhibited compact structure and a low Co content (1.43 wt.%; Supplementary Figs.

and

). This finding underscored the importance of NaCl in Co

CNCl/S synthesis, which not only encapsulated the ultrathin layers of glucose to construct highly porous materials but also constrained the carbonization process to prevent the aggregation of Co species for single-atom formation. Consequently, we provided a facile and mass-production strategy for Co

CNCl/S

) with a high carbon yield of 36.5%, well exceeding the yields by other synthesis methods
and Supplementary 
). Nevertheless, Co nanoparticles were observed without dicyandiamide in carbon matrix (Co
x
CCl/S), demonstrating the added N source also played a vital role in Co atom anchoring (Supplementary 
). Together, it can be concluded that the use of NaCl and dicyandiamide significantly determined the formation of the 3D honeycomb-like morphology and single-atom structure for Co-SACs.
Atomic structure and coordination regulation of Co-SACs
The chemical composition and surface chemistry of the Co

CNCl/S and controlled catalysts were explored. The Cl 2
p
XPS spectra showed a higher binding energy shift in Co

CNCl/S compared with Na–Cl (Supplementary 
). Combined with the imbalanced Na and Cl contents in SEM–EDS, the shift suggested that the increase in Cl intensity was due to the formation of Co–Cl bonds. In addition, the absence of characteristic peaks for metal–S bonds indicated that the exotic S atoms were primarily bonded with surrounding N or C atoms rather than directly with the central Co atom (Supplementary 
). The N 1
s
XPS spectra revealed distinct N species in these catalysts (Supplementary 
). Compared with Co

CNCl, the Co–N peak for Co

CNCl/S shifted to lower binding energy, implying partial electron transfer from the S to the N atom and subsequently to the central Co site

. The categories of N species were also corroborated by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopic measurements. As shown in 
, the N K-edge XANES spectra of the catalysts were dominated by three well-resolved resonance peaks, attributed to pyridinic π*, pyrrolic π* and graphitic π* (
). Compared with CN, the resonance of pyridinic N for Co

CNCl showed a notable reduction. Meanwhile, slight shifts of pyridinic and pyrrolic N were further observed on Co

CNCl/S. In particular, in the σ* region, S doping or Co anchoring resulted in a broader resonance profile compared with CN (Supplementary 
), which indicated the diverse lengths of C–N bonds. All these variations in the N K-edge XANES spectra demonstrated the alterations in the chemical environment of N atoms for Co

CNCl/S due to the second-shell S doping, giving rise to the changed electronic configuration of Co metal centres.

Co K-edge XANES spectroscopy was carried out to verify the atomic structure and coordination environment of Co atoms in Co

CNCl/S. The rising edge of both Co

CNCl and Co

CNCl/S fell between those of CoO and Co foil 
), indicating that the predominant valence state of the single-atom Co lay between Co

and Co
2+
, consistent with the XPS findings (Supplementary 
). The
k

-weighted Fourier transform of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) analysis revealed that the metallic Co–Co peak was not observed for Co

CNCl and Co

CNCl/S, confirming the structure of isolated Co sites 
), which was consistent with the STEM results. More importantly, unlike the reference (cobalt phthalocynine, CoPc) with a symmetrical peak of Co–N

coordination at 1.47 Å, the FT-EXAFS of Co

CNCl/S exhibited a shifted, asymmetrical peak at 1.35 Å. This change was attributed primarily to the axial coordination of Co–Cl, resulting in the distortion of Co atoms positioning out of the graphene plane

. These results were in line with the wavelet transform EXAFS (WT-EXAFS) analysis 
and Supplementary 
). In addition, the use of sulfate precursors in Co

CNCl/S introduced S atoms into the carbon matrix. Based on XPS results (Supplementary 
) and the distinct peak observed around 2.33 Å in the
R
space of Co

CNCl/S in the EXAFS spectrum, which was absent in Co

CNCl, S was probably incorporated into the second coordination shell of Co. Furthermore, the coordination environment of Co

CNCl/S was resolved via quantitative EXAFS curve fitting (Supplementary 
and Supplementary 
–

). The optimal EXAFS fitting analyses of Co

CNCl/S confirmed that a Co centre was coordinated with Cl and N atoms at the numbers 0.7 and 4, respectively. However, the calculated distances of Co–Cl and Co–N bonds for Co

CNCl were 2.26 Å and 1.86 Å, respectively (Supplementary 
), whereas those distances were 2.25 Å and 1.88 Å for Co

CNCl/S 
), respectively. The changes in bond length on Co

CNCl/S were attributed to the S coordination with N in the second shell, which was indicated by a Co–S path length of 2.95 Å. Furthermore, additional DFT calculations further validated the coordination structure of Co

CNCl/S obtained from EXAFS curve fitting 
and Supplementary 
), where the configuration with axial Co–Cl coordination and S–N coordination in the second shell exhibited the lowest formation energy (−2.24 eV), consistent with the EXAFS analysis. Based on the above evidence, the Cl

–Co–N

–S

configuration with a Co–Cl bond in the axial direction as well as planar Co–N

and N–S bonds in the second shell were demonstrated in Co

CNCl/S.
Fenton-like catalysis and mechanisms
The engineered Co-SACs were assessed in catalysing PMS activation for Fenton-like oxidation using phenol as a model pollutant. As shown in Supplementary 
, metal-free carbon catalysts of CN, C/S and CN/S achieved only 11.0%, 22.9% and 24.7% of phenol removal within 20 min, respectively, whereas the Co-SACs with four-N coordination (Co

CN) achieved more than 42% degradation of phenol 
), indicating the high activity of Co single sites for PMS activation. Remarkably, a significantly boosted catalytic activity was achieved on Co

CNCl/S, achieving complete pollutant decomposition within 5 min 
). Conversely, the low activity of Co

CN/S-w/o NaCl can be attributed to the lack of a porous structure with hindered mass transfer and adsorption processes (Supplementary 
), significantly limiting phenol degradation as a surface reaction. The apparent rate constant (
k
obs
) of Co

CNCl/S (0.952 min
−1
) was 19.0, 10.1 and 8.7 times higher than that of Co

CN, Co

CNCl and Co

CN/S, respectively, illustrating the vital importance of co-existing S and Cl coordination of single-atom sites for activity improvement (Supplementary 
). This strong coordination at the Co single site resulted in negligible Co²⁺ leaching at approximately 3.8 ppb, well below the emission standard (1.0 mg l
−1
, GB 25467–2010)

. Such a low leaching level indicated a minimal contribution to PMS activation and secondary pollution (Supplementary 
). In addition, there was no linear relationship between
k
obs
and Co content in different Co-SACs (Supplementary 
), demonstrating that the Co content was not the main factor for improving the PMS activation. Relying on this, the intrinsic activity of Co

CNCl/S based on TOF was compared with previously reported nanostructured catalysts, including carbon-based metal-nanoparticle composites

and SACs

(Supplementary 
). Co

CNCl/S with a TOF of 1.82 min

outperformed most of the state-of-the-art nanocatalysts for Fenton-like reactions reported so far 
). More importantly, Co

CNCl/S exhibited high catalyst production yield and high degradation efficiency compared with diverse carbon-based SACs from different synthesis approaches

Given the boosted catalytic performance of Co

CNCl/S, we further assessed its reaction regimes in PMS-induced AOPs. Commonly, various reactive species have been identified in metal SAC-based AOPs, such as hydroxyl/sulfate radicals (
•
OH/ SO

•−
) (refs.

,

), single oxygen (

O

) (
), surface-activated complexes (PMS*)

and high-valence oxo-metal species

. For these possible active species,
tert
-butyl alcohol can selectively quench
•
OH, whereas ethanol is usually used to scavenge both
•
OH and SO

•−
. As shown in Supplementary 
, these alcohols had no obvious inhibitory effect on catalytic activity. In addition, benzoic acid, as a radical probe for
•
OH/SO

•−
, could not be oxidized in this system either (Supplementary 
). More intuitively, radical trapping tests by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed that these two radicals could not be captured, and the seven-line signal of 5,5-dimethyl-2-pyrrolidone-
N
-oxyl was detected from a direct oxidation product of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-
N
-oxide (DMPO) 
). These results collectively indicated that
•
OH and SO

•−
were not generated in the Co

CNCl/S/PMS system. In addition, 2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-4-piperidinol (TEMP) as an

O

scavenger was introduced in Co

CNCl/S/PMS to further investigate the possible contribution of

O

. No significant inhibitory effect on phenol degradation occurred when adding TEMP (Supplementary 
). The three-line spectrum as the featured TEMP oxidation product by

O

was missing in EPR analysis 
). Moreover, controlled gas (from N

to O

) and water (from H

O to D

O) experiments also showed no influence on phenol degradation (Supplementary Figs.

and

). Therefore,

O

generation was excluded from either PMS or dissolved oxygen. In addition, methyl phenyl sulfoxide did not significantly inhibit phenol degradation by Co

CNCl/S (Supplementary 
), excluding the contribution of high-valence metal species in the Co

CNCl/S/PMS system. Other catalysts were also investigated in the quenching tests (Supplementary Figs.

–

), where most of the catalysts primarily mediated a non-radical reaction (Supplementary Figs.

–

) while C/S and Co
x
CCl/S without N coordination produced radical species (Supplementary Figs.

and

). These observations suggested that N coordination in the microenvironment of Co-SACs was conducive to enabling the interactions with PMS to mediate non-radical oxidation processes, which was consistent with reported studies

,

.
Given the excluded active species, we speculated that PMS was activated to form PMS* to oxidize phenol through an ETP. To validate this deduction, we constructed a dual-compartment galvanic oxidation setup (Supplementary 
). As expected, the Co

CNCl/S-coated reactor showed a significantly increased current (218 μA), achieving 80.6% phenol oxidation within 10 h. This soundly supported the ETP regime accounting for phenol oxidation via charge transfer from phenol to PMS over Co

CNCl/S. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was used to monitor ETP for the catalyst–PMS system in real time 
and Supplementary 
). As shown in Supplementary 
, PMS displayed the characteristic peaks of HSO

−
at around 889 and 1,063 cm
−1
, along with the peak of SO

2−
at 984 cm
−1
(refs.

,

,

). In the Co

CNCl/S/PMS system, in addition to the peaks of HSO

−
, a new peak was observed at around 820 cm
−1
after adding PMS 
), corresponding to the activated PMS* (
). As the reaction progressed, the peak of PMS* gradually intensified, but it disappeared instantly upon the addition of phenol. In addition, corresponding findings were also observed and identified from in situ synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared (SR-FTIR) spectra ,g
). If Co

CNCl/S was adopted, red shifts of S–O and S=O bands were observed, indicating that the HO–OSO

−
structure was bonded to the surface of Co

CNCl/S

. Upon phenol addition, the red-shifted bonds reverted because of the redox reactions between surface-confined PMS* and phenol 
). Together, all the band changes on SERS and FTIR spectra indicated the ETP process: surface-confined PMS* was formed through electronic coupling between Co

CNCl/S and adsorbed PMS initially (denoted as Co

CNCl/S-PMS*); the generated Co

CNCl/S-PMS* captured electrons from the electron donor (in this case, phenol), causing PMS decomposition and phenol oxidation. Therefore, the Co

CNCl/S-PMS* served as the active species for phenol oxidation. ETP was typically preceded by the formation of the surface-confined PMS* as the active species, which created a micro-high-potential regime resembling anodic oxidation.
Understanding the kinetics of ETP during PMS activation necessitates a closer examination of three critical parameters: PMS adsorption, the potential of catalyst–PMS* complexes and their variations. Accordingly, a PMS adsorption capacity (
Q
PMS
) on catalysts was first explored and compared (Supplementary 
). For metal-free catalysts, the
Q
PMS
was generally low, consistent with the poor degradation efficiency due to the limited availability of active sites and weak interactions of N-doped carbon with PMS via van der Waals force

. By contrast, the PMS adsorption on Co-SACs was significantly enhanced, along with the boosted
k
obs
. In particular, Co

CNCl/S exhibited the highest
Q
PMS
compared with Co

CN, Co

CN/S and Co

CNCl, which demonstrated that the axial Cl and the second-shell S dual coordination can remarkably promote PMS adsorption, resulting in a high population of surface-confined and activated PMS.
The open circuit potential (OCP) of the catalysts during reaction was then assessed to reflect the potential of the catalyst–PMS* (Supplementary 
). For a blank glassy carbon electrode, the slightly increased OCP did not change after adding phenol. However, the OCP of Co

CNCl/S swiftly rose after the addition of PMS, levelling off to an equilibrium potential (denoted as
φ
) at around +0.890 V (versus Ag/AgCl), and then sharply fell upon phenol addition. This variation of potential demonstrated the formation of the Co

CNCl/S-PMS* complex, which was consumed with phenol via the following redox processes. Notably, the
φ
of Co

CNCl/S-PMS* and the value of potential drop (defined as Δ
φ
) after oxidation were both greater than those in Co

CN, Co

CN/S and Co

CNCl, implying that the Cl

–Co–N

–S configuration was more favourable to create highly oxidative domains via forming populated and strongly interacting catalyst–PMS* complexes.
Based on the above results, four Co-SACs are comprehensively compared in 
in terms of
k
obs
,
k
obs
normalized by Co content (denoted as
k
per Co
), TOF,
Q
PMS
,
φ
and Δ

. Clearly, Co

CNCl/S exhibited all the highest values of the parameters. Thus, the axial Cl and second-shell S coordination tailored the Co single site and regulated the intrinsic PMS activation efficiency via enhancing PMS adsorption and generating the reactive PMS* complexes with regional elevated potential, ultimately accelerating the oxidation kinetics of co-adsorbed organics via electron transfer.
Theoretical calculation
To explore the impact of different Co coordination configurations on Fenton-like catalysis, we investigated their intrinsic properties using DFT calculations. We first constructed four single-atom structures, Co–N

, Co–N

–S

, Cl

–Co–N

and Cl

–Co–N

–S

(corresponding to Co

CN, Co

CN/S, Co

CNCl and Co

CNCl/S, respectively; Supplementary 
). The projected density of states (PDOS; 
) of Co–N

showed that there were no obvious electronic states near the Fermi level, revealing typical semiconductor characteristics. Upon axial Cl coordination to Co, distinct electronic states emerged near the Fermi level, signifying that the axially coordinated Cl promoted the enhancement of conductivity. With the second-shell S coordination, a pronounced pseudo-energy gap appeared near the Fermi level, suggesting the rearrangement of the electronic structure, leading to the formation of stronger covalent bonds. Unfortunately, the missing electronic states near the Fermi level led to a restriction of electronic conduction in this energy range and, hence, lower conductivity. Notably, the PDOS of Cl

–Co–N

–S

suggested that this coordination configuration highlighted the advantages of the axial Cl and the second-shell layer S. Specifically, the obvious electronic state near the Fermi level enhanced the conductivity of Cl

–Co–N

–S

, while the non-bonded state near the Fermi level was also significantly shifted upwards. These were supported by the electrochemical impedance spectra (Supplementary 
) showing that Co

CNCl/S had a superior charge-transfer capacity, while Co

CNCl with axial Cl exceeded Co

Given the pivotal role of PMS adsorption as the initial step in non-radical ETP, the
d
-band centres (
ε
d
) of the four models before and after adsorption of PMS were calculated 
and Supplementary 
). Our results demonstrated that, compared with other three models, the
d
-band centre of Cl

–Co–N

–S

shifted towards the Fermi level (−1.49 eV) owing to the coexistence of the second-shell S and axial Cl 
). This coupling concentrated the
d
-electron distribution at the energy levels near the Fermi level and promoted the adsorption and interaction with PMS at the Co site on Cl

–Co–N

–S

(Supplementary 
). In addition, after binding with PMS, the
d
-band centre of the Co atom in Cl

–Co–N

–S

moved the furthest away from the Fermi level compared with three other coordination models (Co–N

, Cl

–Co–N

and Co–N

–S

), with the
d
-band centre dropping to −1.95 eV. Therefore, the coexistence of the second-shell S and axial Cl facilitated PMS adsorption and desorption, effectively accelerating Fenton-like catalysis. We further conducted investigations into the PMS adsorption energy (
E
ads
) onto different catalysts (Supplementary Figs.

–

). The computed results established the following order of PMS adsorption capacities: Cl

–Co–N

–S

> Co–N

–S

> Cl

–Co–N

> Co–N

, consistent with the trend of
k
obs

). This demonstrated that the individual coordination of axial Cl and second-shell S led to a stabilized increase in adsorption energy, favouring PMS adsorption. Moreover, co-introduction of axial Cl and second-shell S facilitated strong adsorption of PMS molecules on the Co site to form an activated surface complex, aligning with the
d
-band results.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that the reaction kinetics of catalysts are highly sensitive to the spin configuration

,

. In this work, only the simultaneous coordination of axial Cl and second-shell S (Cl

–Co–N

–S

) exerted a synergistic impact on Co spin orbital filling, leading to a significant change in the filling of the
e
g
orbitals of Co 3
d
in the
d
z

direction (Supplementary Figs.

–

and Supplementary 
). In addition, analysing charge-transfer energy revealed a heightened propensity for electron migration from the Co centre to the PMS molecule in Cl

–Co–N

–S

(Supplementary 
), enhancing its potential in catalysing PMS activation to form a reactive intermediate.
The projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) was used to analyse the bond strength between the central Co atom and the O atom in the peroxide O–O bond during PMS adsorption. Clearly, with the dual coordination of the second-shell S and axial Cl, the absolute value of the integrated pCOHP (IpCOHP) increased (−1.80 eV; 
), indicating a stronger Co–O bond with PMS, leading to more stable surface intermediates (catalyst–PMS*). The changes in bond length and bond strength were consistent with a positive linear relationship (Supplementary 
). A shorter Co–O bond length (1.99 Å) implied a stronger interaction between the central Co atom and PMS, consistent with the PMS adsorption (Supplementary 
). Furthermore, the charge density difference and the average distribution analysis showed a substantial increase in charge density around Cl, resulting in an overall downward shift of adsorption oscillations (Supplementary Figs.

and

). Hence, by virtue of the augmented catalytic activity of the dual-engineered Cl

–Co–N

–S

site, it harboured intensified capacities for both binding with PMS and mediating a local redox process for PMS activation. This caused an uplifted potential per unit of PMS in the activated state, thereby improving the oxidation capacity and accelerating the reaction kinetics upon reacting with organic pollutants.
Drawing upon both experimental findings and theoretical computations, we propose a mechanism of non-radical pollutant oxidation via a 100% Co

CNCl/S-mediated electron transfer process 
). The stable Co–N

configuration, with the axial Cl coordination through short-range strong electronic coupling, enhances conductivity, while the high electronegativity of Cl renders the central Co atom more positively charged, facilitating the interaction and adsorption of electron-rich O atoms in PMS (negatively charged). The second-shell S, through medium-range weak interactions, further modifies the electron structure of Co, boosts the adsorption of PMS, and lowers the conductivity. Notably, the strategic co-coordination of axial Cl and the second-shell S at the active Co site causes an upward shift of non-bonding state near the Fermi level, featured by the
d
-band centre located in proximity to the Fermi level. This configuration not only intensifies PMS adsorption but also enhances the charge migration capacity of the SAC substrate to coordinate ETP. In this bicoordinated structure, the optimal PMS adsorption site (H–O
(I)
–O
(II)
–SO
3(III)
) was the terminal O
III
atom (at the S–O bond), which binds with the active Co site with axial Cl, enabling the electron transfer from the co-adsorbed organic compounds, facilitated by the second-shell S atom with both electron-donating and adsorption functions. This pathway differs from PMS-mediated

O

and radical generation, where metal sites bind the peroxy O
II
or terminal O
III
atom of PMS with hydrogen-coupled electron transfer to form surface-confined O* or SO

* intermediates that further couple to form high-energy

O

(refs.

,

) or metal sites bond with peroxy O
II
and hydroxy O
I
atoms with strong electron transfer and PMS dissociation, thus generating radical species such as
•
OH and SO

•−
(
). These pathways required the metal sites with high electron density to ensure the strong redox processes that spontaneously dissociate PMS into O* or radicals. By contrast, the spatial and second-shell coordination of the Co centre strengthens Co–O bonds and electronic interactions with PMS, exceeding the van der Waals force of the carbon matrix and preventing instant PMS dissociation due to the optimized charge density of the Co site

. Thus, the shortened O–O bond in Co

CNCl/S-activated PMS resulted in the formation of a more stable and high-potential PMS* complex to coordinate the ETP regime. Once the complex potential surpasses the oxidation potential of pollutants, electron transfer transpires between PMS* and pollutants adsorbed on the conjugated carbon skeleton, enabling spontaneous pollutant oxidation in a selective and non-radical manner.
Practical application investigation
The large productive yield and remarkable catalytic performance of Co

CNCl/S inspire us to investigate its practical implementation. Consequently, we assessed the degradation efficiency of ECs with a high concentration to verify the effectiveness of Co

CNCl/S in more scenarios 
and Supplementary 
). Five typical pharmaceutical contaminants and six phenolic compounds were completely decomposed within 9 min with minimal PMS consumption. This indicated the excellent activity and broad applicability of Co

CNCl/S in purifying low-potential contaminants via the ETP regime (Supplementary 
). Pollutants with higher redox potentials showed reduced oxidation (Supplementary 
), indicating that the selectivity of ETP supported the development of targeted wastewater treatment strategies. In addition, one molar phenol molecule consumed about 1.75 mol PMS molecules (Supplementary 
), demonstrating the high PMS utilization efficiency in this Co

CNCl/S/ETP system. The catalyst at an initial pH of 3–11 also exhibited high degradation efficiency (Supplementary 
), illustrating the broad pH compatibility for Co

CNCl/S-catalysed Fenton-like reaction. More importantly, the high removal efficiency of phenol was achieved in various real water sources (tap water, river water, deionized water and sea water) and in the presence of anion and cation interference owing to the high selectivity of ETP and high intrinsic activity of Cl

–Co–N

–S

and Supplementary 
and

). Approximately 85% total organic carbon removal was achieved (Supplementary 
). The ecological toxicity of potential intermediates was assessed using the Ecological Structure Activity Relationships (ECOSAR) software (Supplementary Figs.

and

and Supplementary 
), revealing that most by-products exhibited relatively low acute and chronic toxicity to fish, daphnia and green algae. This indicated minimal environmental risk and highlighted the potential of the system for practical water treatment. Furthermore, Co

CNCl/S also exhibited good reusability, as suggested by the continuous removal of phenol within 5 min over four cycles (Supplementary 
). Postreaction analysis of Co

CNCl/S confirmed its morphological and structural robustness (Supplementary 
). The catalyst also demonstrated consistent performance across multiple synthesis batches (Supplementary 
), underscoring its reproducibility and robustness. Interestingly, this well-defined bicoordinated Co

CNCl/S catalyst exhibited superior activity in oxygen reduction reactions compared with single-coordinated catalysts (Supplementary 
), thereby opening possibilities for extending its application to other electrocatalytic redox systems.

To further meet the requirement for treating large volumes of polluted water, a flow-through column equipment for continuously purifying pollutants in the effluent was assembled to explore the practical applicability of Co

CNCl/S

CNCl/S to maintain the dispersion of the catalysts (Supplementary

CNCl/S loaded, achieving a purification rate of 189.6 l per gram of catalyst. This efficiency can be maintained for as long as 158 h, while the catalyst maintained its morphology well and remained fixed on the support after the process (Supplementary 
). Given these results, a tonne of phenol can be treated at the expense of $USD0.22 (Supplementary 
), which is lower than the reported PMS-AOPs

. This outstanding performance originated from the good dispersion of the highly reactive Co

CNCl/S catalyst on the cotton and its intrinsic well-defined coordination, which prevented the catalyst loss. This high-yield catalyst, which can achieve precise coordination regulation through simple methods, holds promise for large-scale production in practical applications for industrial wastewater treatment and can be applied to various fluidized bed systems.
Conclusions
In summary, the salt templating-confined growth preparation of SACs is promising for the mass production of atomic metal catalysts with deliberate microenvironment engineering. We have achieved a 36.5% yield of SAC catalysts in a well-defined Co–N

centre with spontaneous axial Cl bonding and second-shell S doping. Both DFT calculations and experimental investigations indicated that the short-range (axial Cl) and medium-range (second-shell S) modification effectively regulate the electronic structures of CoN

, realizing an ultrahigh TOF of 1.82 min

for pollutant oxidation. The in-plane S and spatial Cl doping collectively afford an upward non-bonding state near the Fermi level with a lower
d
-band, which are favourable for PMS activation into a surface complex with high potential via a strengthened Co–O bond and facilitate the electron transfer capacity of SACs to trigger the non-radical ETP regime. Further integration of Co

CNCl/S into column separation technology achieved high efficiency in treating pollutants, highlighting the exceptional ability of Cl

–Co–N

–S

to deliver outstanding performance in continuous operations. The precise material synthesis at the molecular level and mechanistic insights of structure–activity relations of this work will not only enlighten the intelligent design of reaction-oriented single-atom materials for high intrinsic activity in green catalysis but also unlock their potential for practical applications in environmental remediation.

Preparation of Co
CNCl/S and other Co-based SACs
NaCl (3 g), glucose (300 mg), CoSO

·7H

O (28.1 mg) and dicyandiamide (332 mg) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water and stirred continuously for 2 h. The resulting solution was freeze dried under vacuum to yield a powder, which was then ground in a mortar and pyrolysed at 900 °C for 2 h under an argon atmosphere, with a heating rate of 5 °C min

. After cooling to room temperature, the black powder was subjected to acid etching with 0.5 M H

SO

to remove unstable Co species and NaCl. The obtained black powder was dried at 60 °C, and the sample was designated as Co

CNCl/S. Carbon samples were also synthesized similarly without CoSO

·7H

O. Other Co SACs were prepared using different precursors of Co salts. CN/S was obtained using the same mole amount of Na

SO

without Co salts. C/S was synthesized without Co salts and dicyandiamide but with Na

SO

. Co

CN and Co

CN/S were prepared by pyrolysis of a mixture of CoPc and CN or CN/S (Co content is approximately 2 wt.%), respectively, at 450 °C under flowing argon for 1 h.
Characterizations
XRD patterns were performed on a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 X-ray diffractometer. SEM images were collected on a FEI Quanta 450 FEG environmental scanning electron microscope. TEM images were collected on FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit TEM. HAADF-STEM images with EDS analysis were obtained on FEI Titan Themis 80-200 operating at 200 kV. Raman spectra were measured using a Raman spectroscopy instrument (Horiba Scientific) equipped with a laser emitting at 532 nm. XPS spectra were collected from a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS system. Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis was carried out under ambient conditions. Both XANES spectra and EXAFS were acquired at the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne.
Fenton-like reaction
A catalyst (0.05 g l

) and 0.4 mM PMS were added to 50 ml phenol solution (0.2 mM) in a temperature-controlled water bath at 25 °C. H

SO

and NaOH were used to adjust the solution pH. Periodic sampling was executed using a syringe, with immediate filtration through a 0.22 μm polyether sulfone membrane (mixing 1 ml of sample with 20 μl sodium thiosulfate solution), followed by transfer into high-performance liquid chromatography vials. These pollutants were detected by an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (Thermo Scientific) system, equipped with a C-18 column and an ultraviolet detection system, calibrated to a wavelength of 270 nm. The mobile phase consisted of 30% acetonitrile and 70% ultrapure water at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min
