synthesis of SACs. The SACs synthesized by the method have high loa dings of SAs and high stability of single -atom sites. of SAs synthesized by the dissolution -and-carbonization and MOF methods. The bond length, coordination number, and valence state of the SACs obtained by the MOF method have trends similar to those by the dissolution -and-carbonization method, and only a few features such as the bond length of Y , the coordination number s of Co and Cu, as well as the oxidation state of Cu, deviate a little from the trends. Thus, the general principles obtained with the dissolution -and- carboniza tion method are not in full accord with those of other methods for the SAC systems with N-doped carbon but can be referred largely by the other methods. 70 / 95
