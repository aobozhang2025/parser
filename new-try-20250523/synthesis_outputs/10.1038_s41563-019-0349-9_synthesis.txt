Extended Materials and Methods
Materials
High purity (99.995%) tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate (TAPN) was purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (no. 482293) and used as the Pt precursor. Five nanometer diameter anatase TiO

(99.5%) crystals with high surface area (290 m2/g) were purchased from US Research
Nanomaterials (Stock no. US3838) and used as the support in this study. Reagent grade NH OH

(28−30% concentration) used in catalyst synthesis was obtained from Acros Organics (no.
423300250). SiO gel (Davisil grade 62, pore size 150 Å, 60−200 mesh, part no. 243981, Sigma-

Aldrich) and acid purified SiO (SigmaAldrich, no. 84880) were used for catalyst

coimpregnation and catalyst dilution, respectively. For the IR and steady-state reactivity
experiments, the following gases were used: 10% H /Ar (±2%, Airgas), He (UHP, 99.999%,

Airgas), 10% O /He (±2%, Airgas), and 10% CO/ He (±2%, Airgas) in an Al tank to prevent

metal carbonyls from entering reactant streams.

Catalyst Preparation
Our analysis focuses on catalysts synthesized using strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA)
principles to deposit 0.025% wt. Pt on 5 nm diameter anatase TiO crystals, described

previously.1 This loading corresponds to ~0.4 Pt atoms/TiO particle, ensuring that Pt cluster (or

even dimer) formation is minimized.
In a typical synthesis of 0.025 wt % Pt catalyst, 1 g of TiO was crushed, sieved to a powder

finer than 75 µm, and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight prior to synthesis. Twenty-five
milliliters of deionized water was mixed with 75 mL of NH OH to suspend the TiO support,
4 2
resulting in a solution pH of 12.2. Separately, 10 mg of TAPN was dissolved in 5 mL of
deionized water from which 300 µL were taken and added to 25 mL of NH OH to create a

precursor solution with a pH of 12.2. The 25 mL TAPN solution was injected over 12.5 hours
into the support solution while constantly stirring to achieve a final total solution volume of 125
mL with a surface loading of 2900 m2/L. Following the slow precursor addition, the final
solution was heated to 70 °C until completely dried.
The catalyst was calcined in a tube furnace at 450 °C for 4 hours in flowing air after ramping up
to temperature at a rate of 10 °C/min. The high temperature and extended duration of the
calcination ensured removal of all remaining amine or nitrate ligands from the TAPN precursor,
which are completely decomposed under these conditions. To ensure consistency, results were
verified across synthesis batches, and the same batch of catalyst exhibited consistent behavior
over the course of months.
ICP-OES
ICP-OES measurements were performed to quantitatively determine the accuracy of the SEA
model at predicting metal uptake. A series of Pt/TiO catalysts with a target weight loading of

0.75% were identically prepared and then pH adjusted. For each catalyst, 1.71 mg of TAPN
(corresponding to a final concentration of 25 ppm) was added to 6 mL of water. Separately, 100
mg of anatase TiO was dispersed in approximately 24 mL of water with microliter additions of

acid or base to achieve the targeted pH under continuous stirring. The precursor solutions and
corresponding support solutions were separately and continuously stirred overnight. To
compensate for buffering effects, just prior to mixing, the pH of each support solution was
checked and adjusted as necessary (no pH adjustment was found necessary for the precursor
solutions). After combining a precursor-support solution pair, the final solution was allowed to
mix for 1 hour. The final solution was then vacuum filtered using a 0.45 µm mixed cellulose
ester membrane filter (Grainger, 14A842), and the filtrate was collected for analysis of the Pt
concentration using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The
difference between the theoretical maximum Pt concentration, and the concentration of Pt
collected in the filtrate must equal the amount of Pt taken up by the support. Thus, the
concentration of the filtrate provides a direct means of measuring the Pt uptake. A 1000 ppm Pt
standard (Sigma-Aldrich, 19078) was purchased and a calibration standard series of five Pt
concentrations was prepared ranging from 0 to 200 ppm for ICP-OES spanning across the
maximum Pt concentration of 25 ppm. For each of the filtrates, Pt concentrations were obtained
at three Pt optical emission lines, 203.6, 214.4, and 265.9 nm and an average of the expected Pt
concentration was measured.
Catalyst Characterization
FTIR experiments were carried out in a diffuse reflectance reaction chamber (Harrick Scientific)
equipped with ZnSe windows, mounted inside a Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance adapter
(Harrick Scientific), and coupled to a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrometer with a
liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT-A) detector. During measurements the FTIR and Praying
Mantis diffuse reflection accessory were purged with dry N . In a typical experiment, the reactor

was loaded with approximately 80 mg of pure α-Al O support, followed by 25 mg of calcined
2 3
catalyst packed on top of the inert support. The catalyst was pretreated in-situ in 50 sccm of a
10% H /Ar at 250 °C (mild reduction), 450 °C (harsh reduction) or 100% O at 300 °C
2 2
(oxidation) for 1 hour prior to analysis. All feed gases were passed through a desiccant and liquid
nitrogen cold trap to remove any humidity prior to the reaction chamber – this was critical for
obtaining clean and consistent spectra.
Upon completion of the pretreatment, once the catalyst had cooled to room temperature, the
system was evacuated to ~ -85 kPa and cooled to -140 °C using liquid nitrogen. A background
spectrum was then collected before introducing a flow of 10% CO in Ar for 10 minutes. The CO
stretching intensity was found to saturate well before 10 minutes. At that point, CO flow was
replaced by Ar under a mild vacuum. Under cryogenic temperatures, CO was also observed
adsorbed to Ti cations, however this CO desorbed at temperatures significantly lower than the
CO adsorbed to Pt . Sequential spectra were taken as the catalyst returned to ambient
iso
temperature during a linear temperature ramp.
Redhead analysis was used to estimate the adsorption energy of CO on Pt catalysts. Assuming
iso
CO desorption is a first order process the activation energy for desorption is given by:
𝑣𝑇
!"#
𝐸 = 𝑅𝑇 [ln −3.46]
!"# !"# 𝛽
Where 𝐸 is the activation energy of desorption, which is approximately equal to the
!"#
adsorption energy if adsorption is not activated, 𝑅 is the gas constant, 𝑇 is the peak maximum
!"#
temperature, 𝑣 is the pre-exponential factor, and 𝛽 is the heating rate 𝑑𝑇/𝑑𝑡. Temperature
programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were performed using a relatively slow ramp rate,
β= 10 °C/min, which enabled collection of high quality FTIR spectra at closely spaced
temperatures. A numerical derivative of the change in intensity as a function of temperature was
then taken. The local maxima of the numerical derivative is a measure of the rate at which CO
desorption is highest and corresponds to the temperature of peak desorption. This is discussed in
more detail in a recent paper from our group.2 A value of 1015 s-1 was used here for 𝑣 based on
justification in previous studies.3,4
CO adsorption energies estimated using this analysis on mildly and harshly reduced Pt /TiO
iso 2
were 84 kJ/mol and 115-145 kJ/mol, respectively, see . In the case of the oxidized
catalyst, CO evolution was observed to occur simultaneously with CO desorption initiating at -

110 ˚C, and thus a CO adsorption energy was not estimated, . It was observed that after
CO evolution, no adsorption on CO on the Pt species could be observed, but that low
2 iso
temperature CO evolution could be regenerated by re-oxidation of the catalyst, .

A temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiment was performed separately to determine
the effect of the pretreatment conditions on the anatase TiO support. In this experiment, 90 mg

of a 1% Pt/TiO catalyst was degassed in Ar for 30 min at 150 °C and calcined for 1 hour at 450

°C in pure O . The catalyst was then cooled to 50 °C and ramped to 450 °C in 10% H /Ar at a
2 2
ramp rate of 10 °C/min. The results are presented in , which shows a desorption feature
at 150 °C corresponding to reduction of Pt and a second feature at ~350 °C corresponding to
reduction and hydroxylation of the anatase TiO support after hydrogen spillover from the Pt,

consistent with the changes observed by the in-situ microscopy between and 2C.
Electron Microscopy
Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) was performed on
a JEOL Grand ARM300CF microscope equipped with two spherical aberration correctors,
operated at 200 kV. High angle annular dark field (HAADF)-STEM images were recorded using
a convergence semi-angle of 22 mrad, and inner- and outer- collection angles of 83 and 165
mrad, respectively. To minimize beam irradiation, a very small beam current (<10 pA) was used
for imaging while the acquisition time was always controlled less than 12 second for each frame.
The in situ STEM experiment was performed in a Protochips Atmosphere gas cell system, which
allows for dynamic observation of nanomaterials heated under atmospheric pressure inside a
transmission electron microscope.
The thickness of TiO may vary due to the nanoparticle morphology. For example, in the

HAADF-STEM image in , the thickness of TiO is increasing towards the top-right,

which causes the maxima of Ti to increase. Since our aim is to emphasize that there is a local
intensity maximum at the Pt atom, two additional intensity line scans, close to the Pt atom
region, are added for a further confirmation, as shown in . In addition to the line scan #1
mentioned in the manuscript, line scan #2 is now collected from a parallel direction from the
TiO region adjacent to line #1. As shown in panel c, it is clear that the normalized intensity of

Ti columns are consistent with the Ti sites in the result of line scan #1, and a very slight increase
is due to the thickness increment of the TiO nanoparticle. Furthermore, another intensity line

scan (#3) is collected from the perpendicular direction to line #1, as shown in panel d.
Obviously, the Pt single atom can be directly visualized in the intensity profile, confirming the
existence of the Pt single atom as highlighted in the yellow circle.
X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) Measurements
XAS spectra were collected at beam line 9-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource
(SSRL) at SLAC National Laboratory. In the experiments, 16 mg of 0.025% Pt/TiO was diluted

in mesoporous silica (MCM-41) loaded into 2.4 mm OD flow-through, quartz tube held placed at
a 45° angle relative to the X-ray beam.5 Fluorescence XAS measurements were collected using a
Canberra 100-element Ge detector orthogonal (90°) to the beam path with 4-layers of Al foil to
filter Ti fluorescence lines, as well as lead shielding to minimize contributions of scattering from
beamline optics. In-situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements
consisted of 4-6 scans collected at 200 °C once the sample had reached steady state, following
three pretreatment conditions (300 °C in 5% O /He, 250 °C in 5% H /He, and 450 °C in 5%
2 2
H /He) and in CO oxidation reaction conditions immediately following pretreatment also at 200

°C (equimolar 1% CO, 1% O , balance He). Multiple scans at each condition allowed for

averaging to improve signal-to-noise. A Pt foil reference was scanned simultaneously for energy
calibration.
The raw data were processed using the Athena interface of the Demeter software package.6 The
spectra were energy-calibrated, merged and normalized. The EXAFS was extracted in k-space
and Fourier-transformation was conducted on the k2-weighted EXAFS function (k = 3.0–12.0 Å-
1) to amplify the oscillations at high k-values. Phase shifts and amplitudes for relevant back-
scattering paths were calculated using FEFF6. EXAFS modeling was carried out on an R-range
of 1.2-4.0 Å taking into account k , k , and k -weighting using the Artemis interface of the
1 2 3
Demeter software. S 2 was determined to be 0.78 ± 0.04 for the Pt L -edge from fitting Pt foil
0 3
(). According to the Nyquist criterion, a maximum of 16 parameters can be extracted
from the EXAFS data in these ranges respectively. The EXAFS data from all the catalysts were
modeled simultaneously to minimize errors.
Kinetic Control and Reactivity Experimental Details
The effect of catalyst pretreatment on the reactivity of Pt sites for CO oxidation was
iso
investigated through steady-state measurements executed under strict kinetic control. The
catalysts were oxidized at 350 °C for 30 min, followed by reduction for 1 hour in 20 sccm of
pure H at either 250 °C or 450 °C or oxidation at 300 °C. Then a feed of 1% CO, 1% O , and
2 2
98% He at 200 °C was flowed over the catalyst for 12 hours to reach steady-state reactivity,
although steady state was reached much faster than this. Temperature dependent measurements
were then taken with the same feed composition at temperatures between 150 °C and 200 °C, for
2 hours at each temperature.
As CO oxidation is an exothermic reaction, temperature and concentration gradients may
develop during reactivity measurements. To ensure differences in catalytic behavior between
materials after different pretreatments were due to kinetic effects, rather than differences in local
temperature or reactant concentration at the catalyst surface, volumetric dilution studies were be
performed. We used dilution studies after 450 °C reduction to demonstrate that the measured
activity for this catalyst was not a result of heat or mass transport limitations. Dilution studies
after mild reduction can be found in our previous work.1 CO oxidation rates were measured on
0.025 wt % Pt/TiO catalysts reduced at 450 °C, diluted with SiO at varying mass ratios
2 2
(SiO :catalyst ratio 8-40). No systematic trend in reactivity was observed with varying dilution

ratio, indicating that the rates measured here were taken under kinetic control, . The
reactivity of all dilution ratios is significantly different than the observed activity after 250 °C
reduction. These studies show that differences in activity between the catalysts are of kinetic
origins, rather than a result of mass and heat transport limitations.
Partial pressure dependent measurements were executed at 200 °C. The total flow rate for all
partial pressure measurements was kept constant using a balance of He. The CO partial pressure
dependence was run first, beginning with the highest CO feed ratio. A 1% O feed was used for

all CO partial pressure measurements. At the start and end of each feed ratio, the reactants were
flowed for 20 min bypassing the reactor to get a baseline signal in the mass spec. In between
baseline measurements, reactants were flowed across the catalyst bed for a period of 2 hours to
obtain a steady state signal. Immediately following the lowest CO feed composition, while still at
200 °C, the O partial pressure dependent measurements began with the highest O feed ratio
2 2
following a 40 min bypass period. A 1% CO feed was used for all O partial pressure

measurements. The alternating bypass/reactor cycle continued for steady state measurements
with sequentially decreasing O feed composition and constant CO pressure.

DFT Computational methods
Spin polarized periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the
Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP).7 The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) was used.8 The self-interaction error inherent in DFT calculations
has been partly corrected using the DFT+U approach where the Hubbard’s U parameter is
empirically set to 3 eV.9 The Projector Augmented Wave (PAW)10,11 method was used and the
valence electrons explicitly treated are: Ti(3s2, 3p6, 3d2, 4s2), Pt (5p6, 5d9, 6s1), O (2s2, 2p4), C
(2s2, 2p2) and H (1s1). We used plane wave basis set with cutoff energy of 400 eV and the
calculation was done at the gamma point. The optimized structures were considered converged
when the ionic forces are <0.01 eV/Å.
We adopted the models of (3 × 1) and (2 × 1) supercell slabs including five-atomic layers for the
anatase TiO or the stepped TiO surfaces, respectively. The corresponding formulas
2 2
are Ti O and Ti O . A vacuum of more than 15 Å is used to avoid the interaction between
60 120 88 176
slabs.12 The TiO surface terminates with two types of Ti cations, 5-fold coordinated Ti

(Ti ) and 6-fold coordinated Ti (T ), located lower than Ti , and two types of O anions, 2-fold
5c 6c 5c
coordinated O sites (O ) and 3-fold coordinated O sites (O ).
2c 3c
The CO adsorption energies were calculated as the difference between isolated species and the
adsorption complexes. Positive values indicate stable adsorbed species. The CO frequencies
were computed within the harmonic approximation, in which CO and its first neighboring atoms
were considered in the calculation. In gas phase, the CO bond length (1.144 Å) and stretching
frequency (2125 cm-1) are obtained at the PBE level. A scaling factor α = 2143/2125 = 1.0085
has been applied to all frequencies to take into account the difference with respect to the
experimental CO frequency in gas phase (2143 cm-1). The effective charge of Pt atoms was
evaluated by using Bader approach which is proposed by Henkelman et al.13–16

reported in our previous study, various models of hydrogenated PtO complexes were used to

properties were used as a tool to test the validity of proposed structures in comparison to

Modeling Pt Uptake
In , a MATLAB code developed in-house based upon the RPA model17–20 was run to
predict the expected Pt uptake as a function of pH for the 5 nm anatase TiO crystals used in this

study (relatively neutral PZC value of pH = 6). The model is a measure of the potential felt by
the Pt ion as it approaches the surface based on a Langmuir isotherm model where the
equilibrium constant is calculated by solely using the Coulombic Gibbs free energy of the
adsorption of the precious metal to the oxide support. From it is seen that for anatase
TiO a relatively broad range of basic pH values should optimize Pt uptake. This was

quantitatively corroborated by back calculating Pt uptake on the support by ICP-OES
measurements of the filtrate concentrations (see ICP-OES methodology). The experimental and
theoretical uptake curves show agreement and that basic solutions (pH = 8-12) are expected to be
optimal for the production of highly dispersed Pt catalysts for 5 nm anatase TiO crystals.

Description of reaction mechanism for CO oxidation on Pt/TiO catalysts

The reaction orders measured were nearly identical following mild and harsh reduction, and are
consistent with previous studies of CO oxidation on metal clusters on reducible supports.21–23
The mechanism proposed for these materials is of the Mars-Van Krevlen type, involving
activated O dissociation at the interface between the metal and the support. A probable sequence

of elementary steps were combined to develop a microkinetic model that yielded a rate
expression consistent with the observed zero order reaction order in CO and fractional (~0.5)
dependence in oxygen, see . Note that while the O order appears to be ½ across the

probed range, the functional form of the dependence is not strictly ½, see below.

Here, * is a vacant Pt site and * is an oxygen vacancy site in TiO . Applying the pseudo-
Pt iso Ti 2
steady state approximation in which all steps but the assumed rate-limiting step are quasi-
equilibrated, site balances on Pt and the neighboring Ti atom were used to derive the following
rate expression:

𝑪𝑶 𝟐 𝟑 𝑶𝟐 𝟐 𝑪𝑶𝟐
Two assumptions were made to simplify the rate expression. The first was that Pt sites were
iso
nearly bare, evidenced by the lack of CO stretch observed in-situ in IR. The second assumption
was that the approach to equilibrium was small. This gave the following simplified rate
expression:
𝟏 𝟏
𝑹𝒂𝒕𝒆 = 𝒌 ∗ ∝

𝟑 𝑶𝟐 𝑶𝟐
Kinetic studies were run over two orders of magnitude, which still showed a zero order
dependence in CO and an apparent half order in oxygen when linearized. Plotting the rates over a
larger range showed good agreement with the model and suggested the elementary steps
proposed were reasonable (). We note that a more complete analysis of the relative kinetic
contributions of individual elementary steps can be obtained through a degree of rate control
analysis, and future work will investigate how changes to atomically dispersed catalyst structures
and reaction conditions influence the degree of rate control of individual steps.24
Effects of the electron beam on TEM imaging
In order to minimize effects of the electron beam during STEM imaging, a very small probe
current (<10 pA) was used for both ex situ or in situ STEM imaging. Typical probe currents for
normal STEM imaging are between 50-100 pA.25,26 Meanwhile, the magnification was always
kept below 6.0 M and the acquisition time was controlled less than 12 seconds to reduce the
electron dose. Considering the imaging condition (a pixel dwell time of 12 µs/pixel and a pixel
size of 0.08 Å2) of our STEM observation, the electron dose we used was less than 1×104 e/Å2,
which is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than typical values for atomic-resolution STEM
imaging. According to the experimental evidence, the Pt single atoms and the anatase TiO

support were stable, and no obvious irradiation damage was found.
For the in-situ STEM experiment, the electron beam was turned off except during image
collection. Moreover, additional experiments were carried out to compare images of the same
area before and after an exposure to electron beam during image acquisition. Here, is an
image taken after the 30-min reducing treatment under 250 ˚C, showing the position of a Pt
single atom on the TiO support, as indicated by the yellow circle. Then, one more image was

taken at the time of 31 min during this process, using the same imaging condition, as shown in
. Apparently, no obvious motion of this Pt atom was observed according to the
comparison between Figs. S9a and S9b, confirming that the beam condition we used did not
introduce the movement of Pt single atoms on the TiO surface. Furthermore, shows an

image of the same area after an additional 30-min harsh reducing treatment under 450 ˚C, during
which the electron beam was turned off. Clearly, the reducing treatment at a higher temperature
caused motion of this Pt single atom. However, the Pt single atom remained stable in the next
image (see ) taken at the time of 31 min of the harsh reducing treatment, demonstrating
that electron beam irradiation (under our imaging condition) did not trigger the motion of Pt
single atoms. Therefore, these results rule out the possible artifact from the electron beam effect,
and the observed Pt atom motion in our in-situ experiment was indeed caused by the harsh
reducing treatment.
X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Characterization
XANES spectra were calculated using FEFF9.9.127 on geometry-optimized Pt models from DFT
calculations. Self-consistent field radii of around 3.5 Å, corresponding to 2 coordination shells
and full multiple-scattering radii of around 9.5 Å were used with the final-state core-hole rule for
the absorber. The COREHOLE NONE card was used.
The stoichiometry of the atoms, which is critical for calculating the Fermi energy, was set to
account for a Pt:TiO ratio of 1:9000 as expected in 0.025 wt.% Pt/TiO . The atoms of the
2 2
ligands and support in the vicinity of the Pt absorber (C and O of carbonyl group, O’s at distinct
locations within ca. 2.3 Å of Pt) were assigned individual potentials and their stoichiometry
adapted to that of the absorber. Ti and O further away from the absorber were assigned the 1:2
stoichiometry of TiO and non-absorber Pt the lowest stoichiometry possible (0.001) to make

their contribution negligible. Pt L -edge XANES spectra were calculated for all DFT-optimized

Pt/TiO configurations described above and shown in 
2 ads 2
excellent agreement to observed characteristics for mildly reduced Pt /TiO . Agreement was
iso 2
found between vibrational frequencies (2121 cm-1 calculated, 2112 cm-1 experimentally
observed), adsorption energy of CO (103 kJ/mol calculated, 84 kJ/mol measured), and structural
features (Pt being in line with Ti cation columns when observed along the axis, ,
and local coordination derived from EXAFS, Tables S1, S2). Good agreement was also found for
calculated characteristics of (PtO ) at the TiO step site and experimental results,
2 ads 2
although with a weaker CO adsorption energy of 50 kJ/mol. As calculated CO binding energies
are systematically overestimated, this structure agrees less well with the experiments than the
(PtO ) on terrace sites, however, from the EXAFS fits, the coordination numbers for Pt-O and
2 ads
Pt-Ti seem to match better for the step site than the terrace.
Calculations of CO adsorbing to Pt species replacing a Ti atom at the bottom of the step
iso 6c
edge, or on the terrace, both showed barrierless CO formation, in agreement with

observations for the oxidized Pt /TiO ( and S5). The substituted position is vertically in
iso 2
line with (PtO ) at step and terrace locations, so both are consistent with the lack of lateral
2 ads
motion observed for Pt species between oxidation and mild reduction conditions via in-situ
iso
STEM. From the EXAFS fits (Tables S1, S2), the coordination numbers for Pt-O and Pt-Ti seem
to match the step and terrace sites equally well, but the average experimental Pt-O bond distance
of 1.99 Å matches the step site model (1.97-2.04 Å Pt-O bond distances) better than the terrace
site model (2.02-2.08 Å Pt-O bond distances). We hypothesized based on these analyses that the
Pt atom sits primarily at TiO step sites following oxidation and mild reduction pre-treatments.

Determining the location of Pt atom following harsh reduction began with the (PtO ) complex
2 ads
as a starting point, as this structure was found to accurately represent the catalyst after mild
reduction. The most stable structures identified following hydrogenation were a PtOH species,
(PtOH) , and a Pt(OH) species, [Pt(OH) ] , although alternative possibilities were also
ads 2 2 ads
investigated. Each stable structure was considered on both terrace and stepped 
anatase TiO sites, -16. Of the stable structures identified, the (PtOH) species, ads
S13, S15, are most likely. Due to the breaking of a Pt-O bond from (PtO ) , this species is
2 ads
expected to be less strongly coordinated to the support and more mobile, consistent with the in-
situ microscopy. The calculated CO binding strength to the (PtOH) complex is 184 kJ/mol
ads
(terrace) and 210 kJ/mol (step); stronger than the CO-Pt bond strength in (PtO ) , consistent
2 ads
with TPD measurements, whereas [Pt(OH) ] has similar (terrace) and much lower (step) CO
2 ads
E values ().
ads
The oxidation state of Pt is another clue: in (PtOH) , it is clearly lower than on (PtO ) ,
ads 2 ads
consistent with the reduced white line intensity in XANES measurements , but
[Pt(OH) ] is predicted to have the same oxidation state as (PtO ) . The CO stretching
2 ads 2 ads
frequency is significantly red-shifted, with Δω , CO frequency shift with respect to the gas
e
phase, of -56 or -75 cm-1for the terrace and step (PtOH) structures compared to -22 cm-1 for
ads
(PtO ) identified as the structure under mild reduction conditions. These shifts correspond to a
2 ads
calculated vibrational frequency of 2087 cm-1(terrace) and 2068 cm-1 (step) in good agreement
with the experimentally measured band positions following harsh reduction of 2077 cm-1 and
2050 cm-1 for terrace and step sites respectively.
From these analyses, the 6-fold coordinated Pt after oxidative pre-treatment, (PtO ) after
subTi 2 ads
mild reduction and (PtOH) ( and S15) after harsh reduction are the model structures
ads
with the best agreement to experimental measurements. Comparison of the experimental XANES
spectra to the fits of these DFT-proposed structures for both terraces () and steps () showed the best agreement compared to the other structures. Because no evidence favors
one site type for the (PtOH) species following harsh reduction, we defer to the broadness of
ads
the CO stretch in the IR and the existence of 2 clear bands to suggest the co-existence of
(PtOH) at both terrace and steps, as depicted in 
Theoretical methods are widely used to obtain electron density maps of materials, after which a
variety of methods are used to partition electron density from these maps into an assignment of
partial atomic charges. However, there is no unambiguous way to assign ionic charge in a solid
and each method has its own limitations. One common approach is the Bader charge analysis,
which identifies charge density minima surfaces as a way to separate atoms in a solid.29
Similarly, assignments of formal oxidation state based on experimental techniques have limits
based on the experimental method and material system. For example, ascribing a linear
relationship between oxidation state and white line intensity based on XAS measurements is
complicated by the fact that the absorption probability depends on the structure of the density of
states above the metal Fermi level, and has been shown to be influenced by cluster size or choice
of support for Pt materials of the nominally same oxidation state.30,31 Likewise, direct
unambiguous assignment of oxidation state based on CO vibration frequency in probe molecule
experiments in not possible, as frequencies have been shown to be impacted by other factors
besides oxidation state, including metal local coordination.32 For these reasons, while exact
values of charge state on Pt cations for different pretreatments depended on the experimental or
computational method used for estimation, the observed relative trends in atomic charge on the
Pt are in good agreement with a reduction in the cationic charge state observed following

Temperature dependent spectral series of CO adsorbed to the Pt catalyst regenerated after
iso
harsh reduction by oxidative treatments. To demonstrate Pt /TiO catalysts remained atomically
iso 2
dispersed following the harsh reduction (1hr at 450 °C in 50sccm H ), the catalyst was

regenerated. The regeneration procedure was a two-part oxidative treatment: first, an ex-situ
calcination (4 hr at 450 °C in air following a 10 °C/min ramp), then an in-situ 30 min oxidation
at 300 °C in 10% O /Ar) as identically performed for the freshly synthesized catalyst

characterized following mild oxidation. The catalyst was probed by CO IR at -140 oC and the IR
spectra were consistent with the freshly oxidized catalyst. The low temperature desorption of CO
is unique to Pt compared to small Pt clusters, where oxidation induces the formation of Pt O
iso x y
structures that strongly adsorb CO (with desorption not occurring until > 200 oC).1 Absorption
features at wavenumbers above 2150 cm-1 are due to CO adsorption on the TiO support.

Dilution study for 450 °C reduced catalyst. CO oxidation rates measured on 0.025 wt % Pt/TiO

catalysts reduced at 450 °C, diluted with SiO at varying mass ratios (SiO : catalyst ratio 8-40).

No trend in reactivity is observed with varying dilution ratio, indicating that the rates measured
here were taken under kinetic control. The catalysts are indicated by the mass of active catalyst
added to SiO gel during coimpregnation, which was further diluted with sand.

Microkinetic model fitting of the rate data taken at 200 °C. Agreement between the average CO
oxidation rate data plotted as a function of oxygen pressure over two orders of magnitude (black
dots) and the microkinetic model fitting (solid red line) suggests the microkinetic model is valid.
A comparison between the fitted equilibrium rate constant for O adsorption at an oxygen

vacancy in TiO K3, suggests O adsorption is favored with an estimated heat of adsorption of -
2, 2
60 kJ/mol (the prefactor used to estimate this was derived from measurements of O adsorption

on oxygen vacancies on rutile TiO ), in agreement with DFT calculations of O adsorption at
2 2
oxygen vacancies on anatase TiO , where the adsorption energy was calculated to be ~73

kJ/mol.33 Experimental measurements of O adsorption to oxygen vacancies on rutile TiO
2 2
exhibit much stronger adsorption energies than on anatase TiO , -162 kJ/mol, and as a result the

magnitude of the predicted equilibrium constant, K3, for rutile TiO would be significantly

higher (14 orders of magnitude) than observed here or predicted for anatase TiO .4 In comparing

with the rutile case, quantitative accuracy is not expected given: differences in the O

adsorption at oxygen vacancies in rutile and anatase TiO , the known differences in surface

versus bulk segregation in anatase and rutile TiO 33,34and the influence that a Pt atom next to
2,
an oxygen vacancy could have on the O adsorption process.

TPR profile (β= 10 °C/min) of 1% Pt/TiO reveals structural changes (i.e. hydroxylation) to the

support induced by hydrogen spillover between 250 °C and 450 °C. This effect is more
pronounced on a higher loading catalyst where there are more total interfacial sites for hydrogen
spillover and would have been more difficult to discern on the 0.025 %wt Pt catalyst by TPR.
