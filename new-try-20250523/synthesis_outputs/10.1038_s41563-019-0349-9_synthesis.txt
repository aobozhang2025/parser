Catalyst Preparation Our analysis focuses on catalysts synthesized using strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) principles to deposit 0.025% wt. Pt on 5 nm diameter anatase TiO2 crystals, described previously.1 This loading corresponds to ~0.4 Pt atoms/TiO2 particle, ensuring that Pt cluster (or even dimer) formation is minimized. In a typical synthesis of 0.025 wt % Pt catalyst, 1 g of TiO2 was crushed, sieved to a powder finer than 75 µm, and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight prior to synthesis. Twenty-five milliliters of deionized water was mixed with 75 mL of NH4OH to suspend the TiO2 support, resulting in a solution pH of 12.2. Separately, 10 mg of TAPN was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water from which 300 µL were taken and added to 25 mL of NH4OH to create a precursor solution with a pH of 12.2. The 25 mL TAPN solution was injected over 12.5 hours into the support solution while constantly stirring to achieve a final total solution volume of 125 mL with a surface loading of 2900 m2/L. Following the slow precursor addition, the final solution was heated to 70 °C until completely dried. The catalyst was calcined in a tube furnace at 450 °C for 4 hours in flowing air after ramping up to temperature at a rate of 10 °C/min. The high temperature and extended duration of the calcination ensured removal of all remaining amine or nitrate ligands from the TAPN precursor, which are completely decomposed under these conditions. To ensure consistency, results were verified across synthesis batches, and the same batch of catalyst exhibited consistent behavior over the course of months. ICP-OES ICP-OES measurements were performed to quantitatively determine the accuracy of the SEA model at predicting metal uptake. A series of Pt/TiO2 catalysts with a target weight loading of 0.75% were identically prepared and then pH adjusted. For each catalyst, 1.71 mg of TAPN (corresponding to a final concentration of 25 ppm) was added to 6 mL of water. Separately, 100 mg of anatase TiO2 was dispersed in approximately 24 mL of water with microliter additions of acid or base to achieve the targeted pH under continuous stirring. The precursor solutions and corresponding support solutions were separately and continuously stirred overnight. To compensate for buffering effects, just prior to mixing, the pH of each support solution was checked and adjusted as necessary (no pH adjustment was found necessary for the precursor solutions). After combining a precursor-support solution pair, the final solution was allowed to mix for 1 hour. The final solution was then vacuum filtered using a 0.45 µm mixed cellulose ester membrane filter (Grainger, 14A842), and the filtrate was collected for analysis of the Pt concentration using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The difference between the theoretical maximum Pt concentration, and the concentration of Pt collected in the filtrate must equal the amount of Pt taken up by the support. Thus, the concentration of the filtrate provides a direct means of measuring the Pt uptake. A 1000 ppm Pt standard (Sigma-Aldrich, 19078) was purchased and a calibration standard series of five Pt concentrations was prepared ranging from 0 to 200 ppm for ICP-OES spanning across the maximum Pt concentration of 25 ppm. For each of the filtrates, Pt concentrations were obtained at three Pt optical emission lines, 203.6, 214.4, and 265.9 nm and an average of the expected Pt concentration was measured. Catalyst
