Preparation of Mo -Co 3O4 and MoS 2/Fe 2O3 The Mo -Co3O4 sample was prepared using a simple precipitation -calcination method. Firstly, 2.1414 g (0.009 mol) of hexaammine cobalt chloride and ammonium molybdate in a ratio of 2.78% cobalt atomic proportion were dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water to obtain a cle ar solution. Subsequently, concentrated ammonia solution (25%~28%) was added dropwise to adjust the pH of the resulting solution to 10.0, followed by stirring and aging for 15 minutes. The solid was separated by centrifugation, washed three times with deio nized water, and rinsed once with ethanol before being dried at room temperature in a vacuum drying oven. The dried solid was ground into powder and then calcined at 365°C in an air atmosphere for 2 hours in a ceramic crucible, with a heating rate of 5°C/m in. S8 For the synthesis of MoS 2/Fe 2O3, 1 mmol of sodium molybdate and 6 mmol of thioacetamide were introduced into a beaker containing 40 mL of deionized water. The mixture was stirred magnetically for 30 minutes, followed by the addition of 3 mmol of commer cially available Fe 2O3. The stirring continued for an additional 30 minutes to ensure thorough mixing. Subsequently, the homogenized solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon -lined autoclave and subjected to a 24 - hour reaction at 200°C. After a purificat ion process, the MoS 2/Fe 2O3 catalyst sample was successfully synthesized. Text S3. Detection of Fe(IV). For the detection of Fe(IV), the specific experimental operation was consistent with degradation experiment for wastewater treatment procedure in addition to replace the model pollutant with methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) and (E) -1,2-Diphenylethene. Experiment verified the possible presence of high -valent Fe in the system by comparing the proportion of high -valent Fe oxidation products (PMSO 2 and 2, 3-Diphenyloxirane) with the characteristics of the two probe molecules mentioned above. 𝜂=𝑃𝑀𝑆𝑂2(2,3−𝐷𝑖𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑥𝑖𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑒 ) ∆𝑃𝑀𝑆𝑂((𝐸)−1,2−𝐷𝑖𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛𝑦𝑙𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛𝑒) Text S4. Radical Quenching Tests. Various sacrificial agents were used to test the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the Fe - N-C-PMS system. DMSO, TEMP, TBA and p -BQ were added respectively at the beginning of experiment and the other steps were the same as the Fenton reaction. S9 Text S5. Cyclic Experiment In the cyclic exp eriment, Fe -N-C (20 mg) was introduced before the start of the reaction. In a 100 mL reaction solution, 20 ppm of phenol and 20 mg of PMS were added in each reaction cycle. After each cycle, the catalyst was filtered from the reaction solution and washed w ith deionized water. And then catalyst was dried in a vacuum oven before next experiment cycle. Text S6. Washing process of reactants on catalyst surface After the completion of the reaction in the experimental group with 10 mg phenol/80 mg PMS/20 mg Fe -N-C (100 mL reaction solution), the catalyst was separated via membrane filtration. The catalyst after the reaction was placed in 20 mL of ethanol. The catalyst was washed with ethanol for 1 hour and then filtered. The ethanol in the filtrate was evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator at 40 oC. After the completion of rotary evaporation, the remaining substances in the flask were collected and further analyzed. Text S7. Testing process of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) First, filter the reaction solution and collect the filtrate. Heat or cool the filtrate to 19 -21°C. Take out 45 mL of the sample, add 10 mL of BOD seed inoculum and add 2 packs of nutrient buffering salt capsules required for the BOD test. Add deionized water to the mixture until the total volume reaches 95 mL. Place the prepared mixture in a sample bottle and incubate it in a 20°C incubator. Measure the BOD of the mixture using BODTrakTM II. Finally, calculate the BOD of the reaction solution based on the dilution ratio of the reaction solution. S10 Text S8. Contact angle test The contact angles mentioned in the manuscript refer to the angles between the material and deionized water. The test samples were prepared using the tablet -pressing method. Approximately 150 mg of powder was placed into the mold, and a pressure of 20 MPa was applied to form a flat sample for testing. A micro -syringe was used to dispense a liquid droplet of 0.6 to 1.0 μL. The sample stage was slowly raised using the adjustment knob until the droplet came in to contact with the suspended droplet at the syringe tip, and then lowered to leave the droplet on the solid surface. The contact angle between the material and the droplet was captured using a camera. Text S9. Synthesis of ZnFe -LDH First, an aqueous solution containing NaOH (0.35 mol/L) and Na 2CO 3 (0.15 mol/L) was added dropwise over 2 h to a 50 mL solution of Fe(NO 3)3•9H 2O (1 mmol) and Zn(NO 3)2•6H 2O (2 mmol), maintaining a pH of 10.0 throughout. The suspension was then aged at 65 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed twice with deionized water and ethanol, respectively. Finally, it was dried under vacuum at 30 °C. The obtained powder is the ZnFe -LDH catalyst. Text S10. Synthesis of Co -N-C-F First, 50 mg of the Co -N-C catalyst and 10 mg of ammonium fluoride are added to 50 mL of deionized water. The mixture is continuously stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Afterward, the catalyst is filtered out and vacuum -dried for 12 h to obt ain the Co -N-C-F catalyst. S11 Text S11. Synthesis of 30T -FNC, 60T -FNC, and 90T -FNC First, 50 mg of the Fe -N-C catalyst is added to 50 mL of deionized water. Subsequently, 30, 60, and 90 µL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) are added to the mixture, respectiv ely. The resulting solution is continuously stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Finally, the catalyst is filtered out and vacuum -dried at room temperature for 12 h to obtain the 30T -FNC, 60T -FNC, and 90T -FNC catalysts. When using TEOS to modify 30 mg TiO 2, the amount of TEOS used is 90 µL and the amount of deionized water used is 50 mL. Text S12. Preparation of SiO 2 Nanoballs First, 7 mL of ammonia is added to a mixture of 28 mL of ethanol and 15 mL of deionized water, and stirred for one minute. Next, 4. 5 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) is added to 45 mL of ethanol and stirred for one minute. After the solution is well mixed, the ammonia solution is added, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Finally, the product is centrifuged, washed five times with deionized water, and vacuum -dried to obtain SiO 2 nanoballs. Text S13. Hydrophobic Modification of SiO 2 Nanoballs First, 466 mg of NH 4F is weighed and added to 70 mL of isopropanol, followed by magnetic stirring for 30 minutes. Then, 0.5 g of SiO 2 nanoballs is added to the mixture and stirred for 1 hour. The solution is subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 129 °C for 20 h. After washing the precipitate, it is transferred to a vacuum drying oven at 197 °C for 3 h to obt ain hydrophobic SiO 2. S12 Text S14. Low temperature activation of TiO 2 A certain amount of TiO 2 was weighed and transferred to a petri dish. The petri dish was placed in a vacuum drying oven, where the vacuum was applied, and the material was subjected to vacu um activation at 197°C for different durations. The resulting material was activated TiO 2. Text S14. Synthesis of TiO 2 3.0 g of Ti(SO 4)2 was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring for 1 hour until fully dissolved. After dissolut ion, 0.1 g of glucose was added and stirred until dissolved. Subsequently, 144 mg lanthanum nitrate was introduced, and the solution was stirred for an additional 4 hours. The resulting mixture was transferred into a hydrothermal reactor and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 180°C for 12 hours. TiO 2 was obtained by washing with a sintered glass funnel, vacuum drying at 60°C for 12 hours. S13 conventional methods primarily rely on van der Waals forces or charge -based attractions, OCTP involves the aggregation of low -polarity, poorly water -soluble reaction i ntermediates on the catalyst surface. This unique behavior is driven by the intrinsic properties of the intermediates — such as reduced polarity and solubility —which promote their preferential accumulation on the S47 catalyst surface rather than remaining dissol ved in the aqueous phase. S48 also showed a double cone shape with two top ends cut off, indic ating the successful synthesis of
