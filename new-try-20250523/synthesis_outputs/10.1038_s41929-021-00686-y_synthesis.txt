Our experimental results suggest that the chemisorption of Pt atoms on the hcp sites of the MXene support, through metal–support bonding, can account for the formation of atomically thin Pt nanolayers.

We found that the atomically thin Pt monolayer is the most stable structure with the lowest energy compared to the nanoparticle structures. Moreover, a comparison of the two nanoparticle geometries shows that with a decrease in the number of interfacial Mo–Pt bonds, the energy of the system increases, further illustrating the preference of Pt atoms to form single or double atomically thin layers with a maximum number of Pt atoms bonded to the MXene surface, rather than nanoparticle- or nanopillar-type structures where more Pt–Pt bonds are formed.

and

). The dispersions of low Pt loading catalysts (0.25% and 0.5%) are close to 100%, indicating the formation of ATNLs, which is consistent with the results of HAADF-STEM and DFT calculations. It should be noted that all these TOF values fell within a relatively narrow range (0.2–0.6 s

The presence of methyl radicals as an intermediate suggests that the ATNLs activate the first C–H bond of methane to form methyl radicals and two methyl radicals in the gas-phase couple to form an ethane molecule that is further dehydrogenated to ethylene. A similar reaction mechanism was also observed in previous NOCM catalysts

TiC

T
x
catalysts tested under 1% methane. Long-term stability (3 days) of the ATNL catalysts was also achieved at 750 °C (Supplementary

. We therefore conducted an in-situ regeneration treatment by feeding an O

catalysts, as demonstrated by the removal of the surface functional groups (-O and -F) and the presence of trace amounts of α-MoC in the MXene supports (Supplementary 
). The contraction of the interlayer distance limits the growth of the Pt ATNLs, facilitating the formation of Pt monolayers with larger size instead of the double nanolayers (Supplementary 
). In addition, the high-temperature reduction defunctionalized the surface terminations, which have been known to anchor Pt precursors

The changes in CNs result from the formation of Pt monolayers that dominate Pt/Mo

TiC

T

and

) suggest that the first layer of Pt is strained to match the MXene lattice, leading to an expanded lattice distance compared to the second layer of Pt atoms (Supplementary Note

). For Pt/Mo

TiC

T

catalysts with higher metal loadings (1% and 2%) reduced at 750 °C, the CNs of Pt–Pt bonds increased while the bond distances decreased compared with the ATNLs (Supplementary

catalysts tested at various temperatures and to compare them with Pt or bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts

With the increase in the reaction temperature, a broad shoulder on the high-temperature side starts to evolve and develops into a distinguishable peak at 510 °C for catalysts tested at 850 °C, corresponding to at least two different types of carbon species. Moreover, our mass spectra results demonstrate that the concentrations of ethane, ethylene and methyl radicals started to decrease when the reaction temperature was higher than 800 °C, while the peaks of benzene (
m

m
/

polyaromatic hydrocarbons were the primary coke-representing compounds (Supplementary 
). Coke formation of NOCM is proposed to be via the well-known hydrocarbon pool mechanism, which was originally proposed for MTO (methanol to olefins)

but has also been applied to methane non-oxidative conversion

. In general, it was hypothesized that the CH

)

,

, which results in the long-term stability of the catalysts at the optimal reaction temperature (750 °C). To obtain a reliable comparison in activity, we synthesized Pt/AC and Pt–Bi/ZSM-5 catalysts and tested them under the same conditions as for the NOCM reaction (Supplementary 
). Under a methane conversion of 8% at 750 °C, these catalysts suffered from coking and showed lower selectivity to C

products compared to the ATNL catalysts, consistent with the observations of the TPO tests.
DFT studies
To gain more insight into the suppressed coke deposition of the ATNL catalysts for the NOCM reaction, the energy profiles of the NOCM reaction and side reactions were investigated using DFT 
). The structures of reaction intermediates and transition states of these reactions are illustrated in 
, with the free energies of different reaction pathways on Pt nanoparticle surfaces and ATNLs calculated. NOCM starts with the activation of the first C–H bond, which leads to dissociative adsorption of methane forming surface alkyl species (CH

*). Our DFT results suggest that the free energy changes of all C–H bond scission steps on the Pt monolayers and double nanolayers are ~1 eV more unfavourable than those on Pt nanoparticles , indicating weakened surface adsorption of the ATNLs due to the altered electronic structure suggested by XANES. Such a weakening leads to the preferential desorption of surface alkyl species to form methyl radicals instead of scission of the remaining C–H bonds towards deep dehydrogenation, which is believed to generate coke precursors.
On ATNLs at 750 °C, the scission of a secondary C–H, that is, from CH

* to CH

*, is endergonic, while CH

* desorption is exergonic. Furthermore, compared with the energy barrier associated with conversion of CH

* to CH

* (TS2), CH

* desorption to methyl radicals is even more preferred, with an energy difference of approximately 0.7–0.9 eV. This is primarily due to the relatively weak adsorption of CH

* over ATNLs. In contrast, the deep dehydrogenation step is more favoured over the surface of Pt nanoparticles, by approximately 0.2–0.3 eV in free energy, indicating that the formation of a methyl radical is less favourable than further dehydrogenation. Compared to the methyl desorption step, C–H bond scissions of overdehydrogenated reaction intermediates, for example, CH

* and CH*, are both exergonic and much more favourable. These findings rationalize our experimental observations that Pt/Mo

TiC

T
x
catalysts readily activate C–H bonds in methane to form CH

*, which is prone to desorption from the surface of ATNLs instead of overdehydrogenation, leading to higher selectivity for C

products while resisting coke formation.
Conclusions
In summary, our experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the epitaxial growth of atomically thin Pt nanolayers on the surface of Mo

TiC

T

MXene. We found that ATNLs of Pt were anchored on the MXene through strong Pt–Mo bonding at the metal–support interfaces, which leads to atomic dispersion and altered absorptive properties of the Pt active sites that favour methane coupling over coking formation. Consequently, Pt/Mo

MXene supports were sintered with the loss of their original ordering of transition metals (Mo-Ti-Mo), and that Pt monolayers substituted the Mo layers to form an atomic layer sequence of Pt-Ti-Mo. This substitution results from the decay of the structural integrity of Pt/Mo

catalysts after oxidative regeneration, as shown by the X-ray diffraction pattern (Supplementary 
). Although Pt nanolayers were still observed in the regenerated catalysts, their chemical environment and size changed, leading to a decreased (~1%) conversion after each regeneration step. Since commercial processes have been developed for converting C

, the NOCM is the last part remaining to be solved, which merits future research attention for visible industrial methane-to-liquid technology.

A spark plasma sintering was employed to synthesize Mo

TiAlC

(MAX phase). In detail, commercial powders of molybdenum (Sigma Aldrich, 99%), titanium (325 mesh, 99%, Alfa Aesar), aluminium (325 mesh, 99.5%, Alfa Aesar) and graphite (7–11 μm, 99%, Alfa Aesar) were mixed with a molar ratio of Al/C/Ti/Mo of 1.1:1.9:1:2. The mixture was loaded into a graphite die coated with boron nitride. Next, the graphite die was transferred into a spark plasma sintering system (Fuji-211lx) where it was sintered at 1,450 °C for 60 minutes and subjected to a uniaxial pressure of 30 MPa. The synthesized Mo

TiAlC

disk was then hand-pulverized in a synthetic sapphire mortar to pass through a 400-mesh screen. The Mo

TiAlC

powder was etched with HF (48%) at 55 °C for 72 hours. The as-obtained Mo

supports via incipient-wetness impregnation. Different Pt loadings were achieved by varying the volume of Pt solution used. After the impregnation of Pt, the materials were dried overnight in vacuum at ambient temperature. Fresh Pt/Mo

Composition and structure characterization
A Thermo Fisher Scientific X Series 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-AES) was employed to determine the mass loading of Pt. After digesting the Pt/Mo

catalysts in a boiling aqua regia solution, the clear supernatant was collected for further characterizations. X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted on a Siemens D500 X-ray diffractometer with a CuKα (

Fluorescence in-situ XAS measurements at the Pt L

edge (11.5640 keV) were conducted on the 10-BM bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, and ex-situ XAS was conducted at beamline 2–2 in the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. A fine powder of Pt/Mo

was pressed into a sample holder made of stainless steel with the catalyst wafer oriented at 45 degrees relative to the X-ray beam. The XAS cell had a water-cooled stage fitted with Kapton windows and ceramic heaters for controlling temperature. The Pt/Mo

catalyst was heated to 750 °C in 3.5% H

for 30 minutes, and spectra were obtained at 200 °C in 3.5% H

. A standard 3.3-cm Lytle detector was employed for measuring fluorescence XAS and the background fluorescence was reduced by a Zn filter. Fluorescence X-rays are angularly dispersed downstream of the logarithmically bent crystal and the Pt Lα fluorescence line was selectively collected by choosing the correct detector angle relative to the bent crystal. ATHENA was used for energy calibration, normalization and background subtraction of the XAS data

. The EXAFS data were fitted by ARTEMIS to determine the bond distance (

), energy shift (Δ

), coordination number and Debye–Waller factor (

). The
k
range for the Fourier transform of the Pt K edge was Δ

, and the
R
range for fitting was Δ
R
= 1.5–3.2 Å. The amplitude reduction factor (
S

At 77 K, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements (N

adsorption and desorption) were carried out using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus to obtain pore size, pore volume and surface area of catalysts. Degassing was first carried out for 8 h at 300 °C before the BET experiments. Elemental analysis of catalysts was performed in a SPECTRO instrument via the ICP-AES method. For Pt-loaded catalysts over MXenes, H

–O

titration was carried out at room temperature to measure Pt dispersion.
Kinetics measurements
The catalytic performance and kinetics measurements were tested in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. Catalysts were activated in a H

-N

flow (H

and N

were 33 and 67 standard cubic centimetres per min, respectively) at 450 °C for 4 hours. The reactor was then purged by nitrogen with a flow of 50 standard cubic centimetres per min for 15 min. Various GHSV values were achieved by varying the weight of catalysts and feed flow rates. The standard operating conditions were 750 °C, 0.01 atm methane partial pressure and 50 mg of catalyst. The absence of internal and external diffusion effects was confirmed using the Weisz and Prater criterion

, while heat transfer effect was also excluded using the Mears criterion

.
An Agilent GC6890 with both a flame ionization detector and thermal conductivity detector, and a Carboxen 1010 PLOT capillary column (30 m × 0.53 mm) were used for quantitative analysis of products. In typical cases, following an initial transient period, the catalyst exhibited stable performance for several hours. All datasets were taken at 10 min TOS during the stable period unless stated otherwise. A blank experiment using the unsupported MXene was tested under standard operating conditions, with the methane conversion <0.01%. All experiments have carbon mass balances of 98.8 ± 0.9%. For the reaction experiments, good repeatability, generally within less than 1.5% deviation, was achieved for all quantitative analyses. For TPSR experiments, the catalyst was reduced using 5 vol% H

at 400 °C for 2 hours before the TPSR measurement. On cooling to room temperature, a 5% CH

in N

gas mixture flow was fed at 20 ml min
−1
, and the temperature was increased from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min
−1
. A thermal conductivity detector was used to detect products. In the TPO process, 5% O

in N

gas was used as the oxidizing gas. The spent catalysts were used for TPO tests. For catalyst regeneration, a 5% steam and 5% O

mixture was prepared and fed into the reactor where the spent catalyst was packed. Then, the reactor was heated to 450 °C and maintained constant for 10 hours. When regeneration was accomplished, the gas was switched to N

for purging for 15 min, followed by feeding 20% H

at 450 °C for catalyst activation before use. For initial catalytic performance tests (less than 1-h TOS), the mass balance was calculated by (∑(carbon mass of detectable products)/carbon mass of methane × 100%.
DFT computational methods
DFT calculations were performed on the MXene–Pt system using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)

, employing the projector augmented wave method for ionic cores and the PW91 form of exchange-correlation functional in the generalized-gradient approximation. The plane-wave cut-off energy levels for bulk and slab calculations were set as 520 and 400 eV, respectively

, while a first-order Methfessel–Paxton smearing with a width of 0.15 eV was evaluated by extrapolating to zero broadening. The energy convergence criteria for all self-consistent field calculations were set as 10
−5
eV, and all structural relaxations were performed until forces were less than 0.02 eV Å
−1
. For structural optimization of a single unit cell of the MXene monolayer, a 12 × 12 × 1 gamma-centred k-point mesh was used. For larger unit cells consisting of 8 × 8 unit cells of the MXene monolayer and Pt film or nanoparticles, we used a 2×2×1 k-point mesh in our calculations. A vacuum separation of more than 20 Å was kept on top of the MXene layer to prevent interaction with its periodic image. Monkhorst–Pack meshes of 7 × 7 × 1 k-points were employed for sampling the surface Brillouin zone for p(2×2) unit cells of Pt and Mo

catalyst. The climbing-image nudged elastic band method was used to locate the structures of transition states in the reactions. A p(2×4) Pt unit cell was used for the adsorption of a methane molecule (CH

*) and methane dehydrogenation that forms CH

*. A p(4×4) Pt unit cell, that is, two p(2×4) Pt unit cells, was used for methane coupling. All transition states were confirmed to have only one imaginary vibrational mode. All free energies were zero-point energy-corrected, and the change in entropies for adsorption processes was calculated using the operating reaction temperature and the relationship proposed by Campbell

. Specifically, the standard entropy of adsorbed species at a given temperature is linearly correlated with the standard entropy of the gas-phase molecules and the ideal gas constant:
$$S_{\mathrm{ad}}^0\left( T \right) = 0.7S_{\mathrm{gas}}^0\left( T \right) - 3.3R$$

where
