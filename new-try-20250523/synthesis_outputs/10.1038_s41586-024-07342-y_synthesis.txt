Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was then used to examine the configuration of Rh species before and after the oxidative disruption treatments. For the
0.17Rh@MEL
, the chemisorption of CO on Rh led to the appearance of three distinct infrared bands 
). The band centred at 2,050 cm
−1
was ascribed to linearly bound CO on the Rh clusters

,

, whereas the other two bands at 2,082 and 2,006 cm
−1
represented the symmetric and asymmetric modes, respectively, of CO chemisorbed on isolated Rh sites

,

. By contrast, after the oxidative disruption treatment, the infrared signal associated with linear CO adsorption diminished, leaving behind the sole
gem
-dicarbonyl adsorption mode. A plausible explanation was that each Rh site, regardless of being isolated or part of a Rh cluster, preferred the configuration of
gem
-dicarbonyl binding on exposure to the CO environment.
To gain insight into the short-range atomic structure of Rh, we conducted X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study on both
0.17Rh@MEL
and
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
. The analysis of the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) 
) revealed that the Rh species in
0.17Rh@MEL
predominantly existed in the form of metallic clusters, as indicated by the similar energy of its absorption edge and white-line intensity with respect to those from reference Rh foil. By fitting the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra 
and Supplementary Figs.

and

), we determined that each Rh atom was averagely coordinated to about 5.6 neighbouring Rh atoms within the first coordination shell (Supplementary 
). By contrast, the average oxidation state of each Rh in
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
was increased, as evidenced by the blueshift of its XANES absorption edge

,

(see Supplementary 
and Supplementary 
for details), and each Rh atom was only coordinated by approximately 4.0 neighbouring Rh atoms within the first coordination shell. Our further combined EXAFS, STEM, FT-IR and mathematical analyses led to the conclusion that roughly 13% of the Rh species in the sample existed as isolated Rh sites and the remaining 87% was in the form of Rh clusters, both comprising surficial Rh(I)-
gem
-dicarbonyl moieties (see details in the ‘Explaining Rh speciation of the samples’ section of

Methods
). Although some approximations were made and thus uncertainties were introduced, it was still helpful to understand the complexity of Rh speciation, and a set of representative structurally reasonable models were accordingly proposed (Supplementary 
).
It is known that even a small fraction of Rh species exposed on the external surface of zeolites may make a substantial contribution to the overall catalytic performance

,

. Despite the high efficiency in encapsulation of Rh into the MEL pores, the deposition of a small amount of Rh species on the external surface was still inevitable, which may have a negative impact on the regioselective hydroformylation of propene. On the basis of this rationale, we sought to use large organosulfur molecules to selectively poison the external Rh sites and only allow the hydroformylation reaction to take place within the zeolite channels. Specifically, 2,4-dimethylbenzenethiol (DMBT) was used as the ideal organosulfur molecule because its kinetic diameter (8.1 Å) exceeded the aperture width of MEL 
) and thus its diffusion into the zeolite channels was probably restricted. Indeed, on exposure to 500 Pa of DMBT/CO mixture at 90 °C, the intensity of CO absorbance in
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
gradually diminished over time (Supplementary 
), indicating the success of organosulfur poisoning at the external Rh sites.

Subsequently, a series of experiments for the hydroformylation of propene catalysed by
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
were conducted 
). In the absence of DMBT poisoning, the pristine
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
exhibited the highest activity with a TOF of about 8,100 h
−1
but a moderate regioselectivity favouring the formation of
n
-butanal (
n
/
i
= 4.9). Notably, on the addition of an increasing amount of DMBT, the observed regioselectivity of
n
-butanal substantially increased from an
n
/
i
ratio of 20 to 80 within a narrow range of DMBT/Rh ratio from 4.5 to 5.0. Such a trend continued until the DMBT/Rh ratio was 8.0. The resulting catalyst, namely,
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL-DMBT
, achieved unprecedented high regioselectivity (
n
/
i
> 110) and chemoselectivity to butanal (>99%) from the hydroformylation of propene (Supplementary 
). Further addition of DMBT beyond 8.0 equivalents did not lead to noticeable changes in either chemoselectivity or regioselectivity. More importantly, the activity of all DMBT-poisoned catalysts remained very high, with TOF values above 6,500 h
−1
. It was worth noting that the above-described TOF calculation reflected an average activity for different Rh sites and thus underestimated the activity of the most active species. Of our effort in the optimization of the catalytic performance (Supplementary Figs.

and

), although the
n
/
i
ratio seemed to clearly decline in the exploited pressure range 0.5–4.0 MPa, when converted into the regioselectivity of
n
-butanal, it was indeed entirely above 99%, reflecting its small variance as a function of the applied pressure. Such a trend was not beyond our expectation and was also consistent with the literature

,

. Both the
n
/
i
ratio and overall aldehydes selectivity showed slight decreases along with the reaction process but still remained very high when propene was completely converted 
). Collectively, it was evident that our
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL-DMBT
showed excellent regioselectivity and activity, surpassing all previously reported heterogeneous and most homogeneous catalysts in the hydroformylation of propene 
and Supplementary Tables

–

). Besides, the superior catalytic stability of
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL-DMBT
was also witnessed in the recycling and continuous flow experiment 
and Supplementary Figs.

and

).
As well as
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
, two more samples with a Rh mass loading of 0.05 wt% and 0.33 wt% were also prepared for catalytic studies (Supplementary Figs.

–

and Supplementary 
). The Rh species in both samples remained in the form of either isolated [Rh(CO)

] or ultrafine Rh clusters with exposed [Rh(CO)

] on the cluster surface, as evidenced by ADF-STEM and FT-IR characterization (Supplementary 
). These samples were subjected to DMBT poisoning and termed
0.05Rh
OD
@MEL-DMBT
and
0.33Rh
OD
@MEL-DMBT
, respectively. All three catalysts exhibited a comparable regioselectivity in the hydroformylation of propene (Supplementary Figs.

–

), further supporting our predictions on the creation of a unique microenvironment for the encaged Rh species on the organosulfur poisoning of the external Rh sites.
In situ FT-IR spectroscopy was used to gain more mechanistic insights of the propene hydroformylation on
0.17Rh

and Supplementary 
). Before exposure to the reaction medium, two observed CO bands centred at 2,082 and 2,006 cm
−1
could be assigned to the symmetrical and asymmetrical modes for CO chemisorption in [Rh(CO)

] (Rh
I
:
d

, 16 e

configuration)

,

. On initiation of the catalytic reaction, these bands smoothly shifted over 13 min, revealing two new CO adsorption bands at 2,073 and 1,998 cm
−1
, tentatively attributed to the symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching modes of [HRh(CO)

] (Rh
I
:
d

, 18 e

configuration)

,

. It is well documented that heteroatoms (for example, oxygen) bonding to metal centres (Lewis acids) in various metal–support interfaces can serve as conjugate bases capable of accepting protons. In the presence of such a Lewis-acid-bonded pair (‘M–O’ bond), heterolytic dissociation of H

can occur, forming the ‘O–H’ proton adduct and ‘M–H’ metal hydride simultaneously

,

. We speculated that a similar scenario may exist in our case, in which the heterolytic dissociation of H

across the ‘Rh–O’ bond at the interfacial zeolite occurred and the resulting H
−
migrates to the adjacent [Rh(CO)

] site to form [HRh(CO)

] (refs.

,

). Another prominent CO band arising at 2,038 cm
−1
under the reaction conditions was consistent with the expected CO infrared pattern of [HRh(CO)]

, which is usually believed to be generated through the dissociation of a CO molecule from the parent [HRh(CO)

]. In homogeneous Rh-catalysed hydroformylation, [HRh(CO)]L
x
(Rh
I

, 16 e
−
) has been widely recognized as the catalytically active Rh species

. Likewise, the formation of an active site containing HRh(CO)] (Rh
I
:
d

, 16 e
−
) is considered a prerequisite for the initiation of the subsequent heterogeneous cycle

. Therefore, we attributed the steadily increasing intensity of the CO band at 2,038 cm
−1
to the accumulation of [HRh(CO)] within the measured time window. Further evidence for the existence of the Rh carbonyl species was also obtained from in situ XAS studies (Supplementary Figs.

and

and Supplementary 
), in which the typical signal for positively charged Rh species and relevant coordination structure remained unchanged on exposure to the reaction medium.

).

To the best of our knowledge, it remains very challenging to experimentally acquire reliable thermodynamic and kinetic data under operating conditions in the zeolite systems as direct evidence to support the imagined shape selectivity and we therefore resorted to the theoretical route to seek the possible rationale. In particular, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to acquire the energy landscape on a theoretical [RhH(CO)

]@MEL model (Supplementary Figs.

–

), which represented the isolated Rh active sites within the MEL pores. Overall, the energy profile revealed that the aldehyde production was predominantly governed by the CO insertion step (from [Rh(CO)

(C

H

)] (

) to [Rh(CO)(C

H

CO)] (

)), which exhibited the highest energy barrier among all the reaction coordinates 
). The insertion of CO at C

H

favoured the formation of
n
-butanal, whereas the insertion on C

led to the undesired
iso
-butanal. Therefore, a comparative analysis of the energetics associated with these two competitive CO insertion steps provided insights into the regioselectivity of butanal formation. In both pathways, the CO insertion step proceeded through a three-centre transition state (
TS(5/6)
), accompanied by elongation of the Rh–propyl bond and migration of the propyl group towards the carbonyl. The elongated Rh–propyl bond pushed the propyl group away from the Rh site, forcing the C

-methyl group to approach the O atoms in the zeolitic lattice. This introduced notable strain into this intermediate species, as evidenced by the considerably increased energy barrier. Notably, the energy barrier for the CO insertion step at C

was 0.43 eV lower than that at C

, indicating the great potential for the production of
n
-butanal over
iso
-butanal. Also, an apparent orientation of the propyl group along the zeolite channel (
b
axis) was observed in
TS(5/6)
n
, whereas
TS(5/6)
iso
exhibited a notable distortion of the methyl tail perpendicular to the
b
-axis direction, resulting in closer contact with the zeolitic framework 
). This was further supported by the greatly reduced distance between the O atoms in the zeolite framework and the H atoms in the C

-methyl group of
TS(5/6)
iso
compared with
TS(5/6)
n
. Consequently, it was reasonable to conclude that the
iso
-butanal formation pathway experiences stronger steric hindrance imposed by the zeolite channels compared with the other route leading to
n
-butanal, consistent with the pronounced difference in the energy barriers between these two pathways. It was noted that there was a large difference in the calculated and measured activation energies. Nevertheless, this was not unexpected and did not affect the overall conclusion on the regioselectivity (see more discussion in the ‘Theoretical calculations’ section of

Methods
). Our parallel calculations performed on the cluster model [Rh

H(CO)

]@MEL revealed comparable framework-directing effect in the exclusive formation of
n
-butanal (see Supplementary Figs.

and

for details). By contrast, such an effect was not noticeable for the Rh site located on the exterior of the MEL zeolite (Supplementary Figs.

–

). These DFT calculation results demonstrated that the confinement effect arising from zeolitic channels played a decisive role in imposing constraints on the reaction intermediates during the hydroformylation of propene, leading to the achieved excellent regioselectivity.

Synthesis of Rh@MEL materials
The encapsulation of Rh within MEL zeolitic channels has never been reported previously, to our knowledge, and the syntheses of our new Rh@MEL materials were modified from the precedent one-pot hydrothermal crystallization recipe, in which encapsulation of Pt and Rh into the MFI channels was successfully achieved

,

. In the representative synthesis of the
0.17Rh@MEL
, a gel solution was prepared by dissolving 0.030 g of KOH (0.5 mmol) in 2.32 ml of deionized H

O and then mixing with 3.880 g of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (6.0 mmol) and 4.120 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (19.8 mmol). A metal precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.0045 g of Rh(III) chloride hydrate (0.017 mmol) and 100 μl of ethylenediamine in 100 μl of deionized H

O. This metal precursor was added dropwise into the gel solution with vigorous stirring. The gel solution was then hydrolysed at 30 °C for 10 h with stirring (500 r.p.m.). The molar composition of the obtained gel was 66.7 (K

):1,600.8 (TBAOH): 6,8921.1 (H

). The resultant yellow solution was transferred into a 50-ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 130 °C for 24 h under static conditions. Following the hydrothermal crystallization, the solid product was isolated by centrifugation and sequentially washed with deionized water and ethanol. Subsequently, it was dried at 80 °C for 12 h in ambient air. The obtained solid sample was further calcined in static air at 560 °C for 5 h and then reduced under a flow of H

/Ar mixture at 600 °C for 2 h. The as-prepared sample was denoted
0.17Rh@MEL
.

A CO pretreatment was subsequently conducted to disrupt Rh clusters into isolated atoms and thus generate the atomically dispersed Rh sites on the original
0.17Rh@MEL
sample. For details, the
0.17Rh@MEL
sample was loaded into quartz tubes and subjected to heating under a continuous flow of CO (0.5 MPa) at 90 °C for 2 h. The Rh loading in the resulting
0.17Rh

ICP-OES measurement
The metallic elemental composition of prepared materials was determined by ICP-OES using an Optima 2100 DV spectrometer.
Powder X-ray diffraction measurement
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (
λ
= 1.5406 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The data were obtained by a step-scan mode over a 2
θ
range from 5° to 90°, with a scanning step of 0.02°. Calibration of 2

was accomplished using LaB

powder.
ADF-STEM measurement
The ADF-STEM images were collected at 300 kV with aberration-corrected STEM (FEI, Titan Cubed Thermis G2 and JEOL, JEM-ARM300F). For all data, either 2,048 × 2,048-pixel or 1,024 × 1,024-pixel images were recorded and the dwell time for each pixel was varied from 3 µs up to 12 µs. The beam current used was below 10 pA. The mapping of energy-dispersive spectroscopy was performed using TEM (FEI, Talos) operated at 200 kV.
FT-IR spectroscopy
FT-IR measurements were performed using a Bruker VERTEX 70v spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride detector. The spectra were recorded in transmission mode using averaging 64 scans at a resolution of 4 cm
−1
within the range 1,000–4,000 cm
−1
. Approximately 20 mg of samples were pressed into a self-supported wafer with a diameter of 13 mm and loaded into a specially designed high-temperature infrared cell fitted with a BaF

window and connected to a vacuum-adsorption apparatus, which allows for dynamic pressure control (Supplementary 
). Before the adsorption measurement, the samples were reduced under a flow of atmospheric H

at 500 °C for 1 h and then evacuated for 30 min, followed by cooling down to 25 °C under dynamic vacuum. Afterwards, CO was admitted into the cell with stepwise pressure of CO and the infrared spectra were continuously recorded until the signal stabilized. To monitor the thiol poisoning process, the evolution of infrared spectra was collected while exposing the oxidatively disrupted samples to a vapour of DMBT carried with CO at 5 mbar. For in situ FT-IR measurements, the oxidatively disrupted samples were loaded into a custom-made infrared cell (Supplementary 
) with a narrow optical path (200 μm) and then exposed to a mixture of H

/CO/propene/Ar (47:47:2:4, v/v/v/v) at 90 °C with a total pressure of 4 MPa. The signal of gaseous CO was subtracted from the original FT-IR spectra based on a previously reported data-processing approach

, to eliminate its interference in the observation of the CO signal from Rh carbonyl.
XAS measurement
The XAS study at the Rh K-edge was carried out at the BL14W1 and BL13SSW beamlines of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, using a Si double-crystal monochromator. Data were recorded in fluorescence yield mode, using a four-element Ge detector. Energy calibration was achieved using Rh foil and the tabulated edge energy was defined as the first inflection point in the derivative spectrum. Data reduction and analysis were performed using the ATHENA and ARTEMIS software

. The data were fitted in R-space with theoretical models constructed from FEFF based on the crystal structures of Rh metal and DFT-optimized [Rh(CO)

]@MEL and [RhH(CO)

]@MEL. For the XAS measurement, the sample was compressed into flakes of thickness 5 mm and loaded into custom-made cells, followed by pretreatment under continuous flow of H

at 500 °C for 1 h and cooling to 90 °C in an Ar atmosphere. The gas flow was subsequently switched to CO, during which the XAS spectra were recorded to monitor the structural evolution during the oxidative disruption of Rh species. A similar pre-treatment procedure was also adopted before in situ XAS measurement, which was then performed after exposure to pressurized gas of H

/CO/propene/Ar (4 MPa, 47:47:2:4, v/v/v/v) at 90 °C.
Explaining Rh speciation of the samples
A library containing varieties of models as a statistical foundation for the extraction of Rh–Rh, Rh–O and Rh–C scattering paths was first established. In particular, the Rh–Rh scattering path was extracted from the crystal structure of Rh metal and Rh

(CO)

. Rh metal is the most commonly used standard and Rh

(CO)

is a thermodynamically stable organometallic compound with Rh cluster size comparable with our case. The Rh–O scattering path was extracted from the crystal structure of Rh

O

and a theoretical [Rh(CO)

]@MEL model optimized from DFT calculations. Rh

O

is the most frequently used Rh oxide standard. The [Rh(CO)

]@MEL model with direct Rh–O bonding to zeolite should be more representative of the catalyst. Extraction of the Rh–C scattering path was based on more known models, Rh

Cl

(CO)

, Rh

(CO)

, Rh

(CO)

and the theoretical [Rh(CO)

]@MEL model, which all have the same [Rh(CO)

] structural unit in common.
All of these extracted Rh–Rh, Rh–C and Rh–O scattering paths together formed 16 combinations available for fitting the Fourier-transformed EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) spectrum of the
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
catalyst. The fitting was processed in the ARTEMIS software and a good fit should have a small R-factor, which is a measure of the percentage misfit between the data and theory. Through systematic analysis of the fitting results, there was almost no difference in the obtained R-factor following fitting with different combinations (Supplementary 
).
Meanwhile, to solidify a link between the experimental and theoretical results, we thus chose the crystal structure of Rh metal to extract the Rh–Rh scattering path and the models optimized by DFT calculations to extract the Rh–O and Rh–C scattering paths for fitting with the FT-EXAFS spectrum of
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
catalyst. The generated theoretical FT-EXAFS spectrum through data fitting and three experimentally obtained FT-EXAFS spectra of reference materials (Rh foil, Rh

O

and Rh

Cl

(CO)

) are shown in 
.
In short, CN
Rh-Rh
of 4.0, CN
Rh-O
of 1.0 and CN
Rh-C
of 1.1 were successfully determined by using the previously established method. This result is clearly indicative of the average number of Rh, O and C atoms that coordinate to each Rh atom in the
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
through Rh–Rh, Rh–O and Rh–C covalent bonds, and it is statistically meaningful and of high relevance. By comparing the infrared characterization results of isolated Rh sites with a large amount of literature

,

,

,

, the presence of a Rh(I)-
gem
-dicarbonyl structural unit within the isolated sites has been unambiguously confirmed. An important background here is that Rh(I) (
d

configuration, 16 e
−
) ions are well known in classical coordination chemistry for the violation of the 18 e
−
rule and they generally adopt a square-planar geometry. It is thus reasonable to infer that the Rh atom in the isolated sites is coordinated with two CO ligands and the other two O atoms from the surface of the internal zeolite channels through Rh–O bonding (Supplementary 
). In other words, no other Rh atoms are through to coordinate with that from the isolated site. The CN
Rh-Rh
of the isolated Rh site is therefore assumed to be zero.
Clearly, from a statistical perspective, the experimentally obtained CN
Rh-Rh,experiment
of 4.0 is the weighted average of those from the CN
Rh-Rh,isolated site
and CN
Rh-Rh,cluster
, if the isolated sites and the clusters are treated as a whole, respectively. Here, if we can confirm the value of CN
Rh-Rh,cluster
, we should be able to mathematically derive the proportion of isolated sites and clusters in the sample, which will be very helpful for us to understand the impact of introducing complexity from a quantitative perspective.
For Rh atoms in a cluster, the surface Rh atoms are usually unsaturated in coordination and their CN
Rh-Rh
value is small, whereas the internal Rh atoms are usually coordinated with more neighbour Rh atoms and their CN
Rh-Rh
value is larger. Therefore, the CN value presented for a cluster (namely, CN
Rh-Rh,cluster
) is also the result of a weighted average of the CN
Rh-Rh
values of all Rh atoms contained in the cluster.
However, the real situation is that the sample contains Rh clusters of more than one size. As far as we know, there is no effective method so far that can identify the precise proportion of clusters of each size in similar situations. Therefore, we made an approximation here that a cluster with a statistically average size of 0.64 nm, confirmed by the STEM investigation (Supplementary 
), is used to represent all clusters for subsequent analysis and discussion. Because the size of the cluster is known, according to the method established in the literature

, we can approximately estimate the total number of Rh atoms (
N
atom
) by assuming that the cluster follows a quasi-spherical structure:
$${N}_{{\rm{atom}}}={(1.82R/D)}^{3}$$

in which
D
is the distance between two adjacent Rh atoms (
D
= 2.7 Å) and
R
is the radius of Rh cluster (
R
= 3.2 Å). According to the calculation based on equation (

), we can conclude that a Rh cluster with a size of 0.64 nm has a total of approximately ten Rh atoms.
Moreover, the average number of neighbours for each coordination shell as a function of the number of atoms present in a cluster can be modelled by using a hyperbolic function with four parameters, as documented in the literature

. We thereafter performed calculation of the CN
Rh-Rh,cluster
using the following equation:
$${{\rm{CN}}}_{{\rm{Rh}}-{\rm{Rh}},{\rm{cluster}}}=a{N}_{{\rm{atom}}}/(b+{N}_{{\rm{atom}}})+c{N}_{{\rm{atom}}}/(d+{N}_{{\rm{atom}}})$$

in which
a
(8.981),
b
(9.640),
c
(3.026) and
d
(1,462.61) are constant parameters taken from the above reference. According to the calculation of equation (

), we can conclude that, in a cluster of ten Rh atoms, each Rh atom is coordinated by approximately 4.6 Rh atoms on average.
With this information in hand, we were able to revisit the previous question of how to mathematically derive the proportion of isolated sites and clusters in the sample, because the experimentally obtained CN
Rh-Rh,experiment
is the weighted average of those from the CN
Rh-Rh, isolated site
and CN
Rh-Rh, cluster
. Here, the proportion of the total number of Rh atoms counted for all isolated sites, equivalent to the number of isolated sites, to the total number of Rh atoms of the entire sample was assumed to be
x
and that of the Rh clusters was presumed to be (1 −
x
) accordingly. Hence, an
x
value of 0.13 could be determined from equation (

) as follows:
$${{\rm{C}}{\rm{N}}}_{{\rm{R}}{\rm{h}}-{\rm{R}}{\rm{h}},{\rm{e}}{\rm{x}}{\rm{p}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{t}}}=x{{\rm{C}}{\rm{N}}}_{{\rm{R}}{\rm{h}}-{\rm{R}}{\rm{h}},{\rm{i}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{e}}}+(1-x){{\rm{C}}{\rm{N}}}_{{\rm{R}}{\rm{h}}-{\rm{R}}{\rm{h}},{\rm{c}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{r}}}$$

This result revealed that roughly 13% of the Rh species in the sample existed as isolated sites and the remaining 87% was in the form of Rh clusters.
Likewise, the experimentally obtained CN
Rh-O,experiment
(1.0) could be treated as the weighted average of those from the CN
Rh-O,isolated site
and CN
Rh-O,cluster
, respectively. As the Rh atom is coordinated to two oxygen atoms, the CN
Rh-O,isolated site
was assumed to be 2. Hence, we were able to obtain the value of CN
Rh-O,cluster
as 0.9 from equation (

) as follows:
$${{\rm{C}}{\rm{N}}}_{{\rm{R}}{\rm{h}}-{\rm{O}},{\rm{e}}{\rm{x}}{\rm{p}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{t}}}=0.13{{\rm{C}}{\rm{N}}}_{{\rm{R}}{\rm{h}}-{\rm{O}},{\rm{i}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{e}}}+0.87{{\rm{C}}{\rm{N}}}_{{\rm{R}}{\rm{h}}-{\rm{O}},{\rm{c}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{r}}}$$

Similarly, the value of CN
Rh-C,cluster
could be determined as 1.0 from equation (

) as follows:
$${{\rm{CN}}}_{{\rm{Rh}}-{\rm{C}},{\rm{experiment}}}=0.13{{\rm{CN}}}_{{\rm{Rh}}-{\rm{C}},{\rm{isolated}}{\rm{site}}}+0.87{{\rm{CN}}}_{{\rm{Rh}}-{\rm{C}},{\rm{cluster}}}$$

We were keen to obtain the CN
Rh-O,cluster
of 0.9 and CN
Rh-C,cluster
of 1.0, as it implies that about an equal number of Rh–C and Rh–O bonds formed in the Rh

cluster. A possible rationale here is that about half of the Rh atoms in the Rh

cluster are bonded to the oxygen atoms of the zeolitic framework and another half of the Rh atoms are bonded to the CO by means of the Rh-
gem
-dicarbonyl configuration. This coordination mode adopted by the Rh

cluster does not conflict with the knowledge we obtained by conducting FT-IR studies on
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
, only the characteristic infrared feature associating with Rh(I)-
gem
-dicarbonyl witnessed, which proved the rationality of our speculation from another aspect. As such, the representative Rh

cluster model proposed in Supplementary 
is reasonable, under the premise of making some assumptions in advance.
It was worth noting that the premise of these discussions was based on some assumptions, which would thus bring some deviations. Indeed, rarely precedent, to the best of our knowledge, has used such a procedure to roughly quantify the component of a complex composition through the interpretation of the fitted results of EXAFS data

. As such, we prefer not to overinterpret these results but rather take it as a rough reference to illustrate the complexity of Rh species.
The Rh species in the sample, despite being in the form of isolated sites or Rh clusters, were both responsible for the regioselective catalysis owing to comprising surficial Rh(I)-
gem
-dicarbonyl moieties. Besides the isolated Rh sites, the surface Rh atoms of the clusters exposed inside the zeolite pore also adopted the configuration of Rh(I)-
gem
-dicarbonyl, which was proved to be catalytically active in the regioselective hydroformylation of propene. As such, as well as those isolated Rh sites (roughly 13% of the total Rh species), the Rh cluster (about 87% of the total Rh species) surface exposed in the pores can also provide a large number of single-atom Rh sites to promote the reaction and contribute to the resulting regioselectivity.
Evaluating the encapsulation efficiency of Rh@MEL samples
The spatial distribution of Rh species within
Rh@MEL
samples was determined using the methods proposed in refs.

,

. In general, the active sites both inside and outside the zeolite channels/voids would contribute to the catalytic conversion of substrates, as long as the diffusion diameter is lower than that of zeolite apertures. By contrast, the molecules that possess larger size than that of zeolite apertures could not access the active sites within the zeolite channels/voids, therefore the contribution to its conversion should be attributed to the metallic species outside the zeolite channels/voids. As such, the proportion of active sites inside the zeolite channels/voids could be estimated on the basis of the difference in the reaction rate between small and large molecules. In particular, we chose 1-octene (kinetic diameter = 5.3 Å) and cyclooctene (kinetic diameter = 8.0 Å) as probe reactants and taking hydrogenation of them as the model reaction to differentiate the relative content of Rh species located outside and inside the channel/voids of MEL zeolite (aperture dimensions 5.3 × 5.4 Å). In detail, the hydrogenation rates for 1-octene and cyclooctene on an unconstrained cluster dispersed on fumed silica (Rh/SiO

, prepared by wet impregnation) were first measured and the ratio of TOF
1-octene
and TOF
cyclooctene
(

) was approximately regarded as the standard relative reactivity of these two molecules. Similarly, the
χ
MEL
was also calculated by measuring the ratio of TOF
1-octene
and TOF
cyclooctene
on Rh–MEL samples. The proportion of MEL-encapsulated sites was thus estimated as 1 −

.
In a typical measurement,
Rh@MEL
sample, 1-octene (or cyclooctene) and cyclohexane was loaded into the autoclave, which was purged with hydrogen four times and then pressurized to 4 MPa. The autoclave was then heated to 70 °C with stirring at 800 r.p.m. for 20 min and subsequently cooled in an ice bath. The resulting reaction mixture was separated by centrifugation and then mixed with 100 μl of
n
-nonane (internal standard). The mixture was then analysed by an Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and a flame-ionized detector (FID). The TOFs were calculated as the number of molecules converted per hour normalized by the total number of Rh atoms within the samples. To exclude the influence of mass transfer on the reaction rate, the reaction was conducted in the kinetic regime by maintaining the conversion of 1-octene or cyclooctene below 10%.
Catalytic evaluations
The hydroformylation of propene was performed in a 25-ml stainless-steel autoclave with an inner diameter of 28 mm and a height of 42 mm, equipped with an electric heating furnace. In a typical evaluation process, 20 mg of
Rh
OD
@MEL
sample together with 4 ml of toluene and a certain amount of DMBT were charged in the autoclave, which was then purged with feed gas (H

/CO/propene/Ar mixture, 47:47:2:4, v/v/v/v) four times and pressurized to 4 MPa. The reaction was conducted at 90 °C with stirring at 800 r.p.m. for 3 h. Subsequently, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and carefully depressurized to atmospheric pressure. Then, 100 μl of
n
-nonane was added as an internal standard into the reaction mixture, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 r.p.m. for 5 min to collect the liquid phase of the reaction mixture, which was subsequently analysed by an Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and a FID. The tail gas was collected and analysed by Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a FID. The permanent gases (Ar, CO and H

) and hydrocarbons (propene, propane) in the tail gas were separated by an HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and a GasPro (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.32 μm) capillary column, respectively. Propene conversion was determined by tracking its concentration changes in both the gaseous and the liquid mixtures, using Ar and
n
-nonane as internal references, respectively. Specifically, the concentration of propene in the liquid mixture was ascertained through

H NMR analysis. The catalytic evaluation was also carried out in a stainless-steel fixed-bed reactor with an inner diameter of 9.0 mm. Generally, 0.2 g of
0.17Rh
OD
@MEL
catalyst with 60–80 mesh was loaded in the isothermal region of the reactor and pressurized with a gaseous mixture of H

/CO/propene/Ar (47:47:2:4, v/v/v/v) to 4 MPa, followed by heating to 90 °C with a ramping rate of 1 °C min
−1
. Then, the liquid mixture of DMBT/toluene (0.72 mmol l
−1
of DMBT in toluene) was pumped into the reactor by means of a constant-flux pump. The tail gas was passed through a cold trap to collect the liquid mixture, whereas the volatile gas was analysed by online Agilent 8890 gas chromatography.
The TOF was calculated as the number of aldehydes produced per hour, normalized to the total number of Rh atoms within the samples, as follows:
$${\rm{TOF}}=\frac{{\rm{Moles}}\,{\rm{of}}\,{\rm{aldehydes}}}{{\rm{Moles}}\,{\rm{of}}\,{\rm{Rh}}\,{\rm{in}}\,{\rm{the}}\,{\rm{catalyst}}\times (1-{\chi }_{{\rm{SiO2}}}/{\chi }_{{\rm{MEL}}})\times {\rm{reaction}}\,{\rm{time}}}$$
whereas the (1 −
χ

/
χ
MEL
) represents the proportion of Rh inside the channels/voids with respect to the total Rh loading into the materials. All of the experiments for the estimation of TOFs were conducted with propene conversion below 40%, at which the reaction was assumed to follow a zero-order kinetics (Supplementary 
). The influence of gas–liquid mass transfer during the catalytic evaluation was minimized, as evidenced by Supplementary 
. Three replicates for each catalytic run were conducted under identical procedures, with accompanying error bars to reflect the repeatability of the data.
The catalytic recyclability of prepared catalysts was evaluated by recycling the spent samples recovered at the end of each run and used for the next cycle. In detail, the spent catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and washed with toluene three times, followed by calcination in static air at 560 °C for 5 h and then reduction by H

/Ar mixture at 500 °C for 1 h.

methods. All of the calculated Gibbs free energies were corrected at the reaction temperature of 90 °C according to a literature method

. It should be noted that, despite taking these adjustments into account, a large deviation from theoretically calculated results and corresponding experimental values has still emerged. Indeed, such a deviation has been broadly witnessed in Rh-catalysed hydroformylation of propene

,

. Inherent computational limitations and approximations usually contributed to the observations

,

. Nonetheless, both the applied theoretical model and the computational method in our calculations were maintained the same throughout the exploration of both reaction pathways. Hence, the above-mentioned deviation between experimental and theoretical results would not affect the overall conclusion. We thus reasoned that the evaluation of the kinetic differences between two reaction pathways by directly comparing their energy barriers under the same benchmark was reliable. Our DFT calculations were carried out only at 4 MPa, which was same as the pressure chosen for the experimental studies, and we reasoned that such an option was appropriate. Moreover, because the change of pressure did not have a large impact on the selectivity (Supplementary 
), we assumed that it might not be necessary to conduct exhaustive DFT calculations at all other different pressures at the expense of valuable computing resources.
The theoretical model of [Rh(CO)

]@MEL was constructed by locating the Rh atom within a silanol nest inside the channels of MEL zeolite. In detail, the MEL model was first obtained by structural optimization of a crystalline unit cell of MEL zeolite derived from the Crystallography Open Database. Subsequently, a silanol nest was created by removing one skeletal Si atom from either inside or outside the MEL channel. A single Rh atom was then located in the silanol group and coordinated with two O atoms to generate an isolated Rh mode. The cluster model [Rh

H(CO)

]@MEL was constructed using a similar approach, but in which three Rh atoms were separately coordinated with O in the silanol nests.
The kinetic dimensions of molecules were predicted by Multiwfn wavefunction analysis using the Multiwfn 3.7 program

. The molecular model was first optimized by the Gaussian 16 program package at the level of B3LYP/6-311 G(d, p) (refs.

). The derived wavefunction of molecules was imported into the Multiwfn program to obtain the kinetic dimensions based on electron-density surface analysis
