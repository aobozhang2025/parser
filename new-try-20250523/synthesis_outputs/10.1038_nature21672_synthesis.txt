Preparation of catalysts
α-MoC support
. Ammonium paramolybdate ((NH

)

Mo

O

•4H

O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. A grinded powder of ammonium paramolybdate was calcined in a muffle oven to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C min
−1
to synthesize the precursor MoO

. Then 0.8 g MoO

was loaded into a quartz tube reactor and placed in a vertical furnace. The powder was heated to 700 °C in NH

(100 ml min
−1
; pre-purified gas) at a rate of 5 °C min
−1
and kept at 700 °C for 2 hours. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the gas was then switched to a CH

/H

mixture (100 ml min
−1
; 20/80 v/v), and the temperature was increased to 700 °C at 5 °C min
−1
and held at 700 °C for 2 hours. Finally, the sample was passivated at room temperature using a 0.5% O

/He gas mixture

. Elemental analysis finds that the Mo/C ratio of α-MoC is around 1/0.8.
β-Mo

C support
. β-Mo

C was synthesized using the same precursor as α-MoC, as follows: 0.8 g MoO

was loaded in the quartz tube and carburized with a CH

/H

mixture (100 ml min
−1
; 20/80 v/v), with the temperature being increased at 5 °C min
−1
to 300 °C, then at 1 °C min
−1
to 700 °C. After carburization at 700 °C for 2 hours, the sample was cooled to room temperature and passivated using a 0.5% O

/He gas mixture.
2%Pt/β-Mo

C catalyst
. The passivated β-Mo

C support was transferred to a deaerated, aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of chloroplatinic acid (H

PtCl

•6H

O) to achieve the desired loading. The slurry was stirred for 3 hours, dried using evaporation, and then transferred to a freeze dryer overnight to remove any moisture. Before catalytic evaluation, the catalyst was activated with a CH

/H

mixture (15/85 v/v). The activation temperature program heated the sample to 300 °C and held it there for 1 hour. The temperature was then increased to 590 °C at a rate of 5 °C min
−1
and held there for another 2 hours.
2%Pt/α-MoC and 2%Pt/MoC-2 catalysts
. An appropriate amount of H

PtCl

•6H

O was loaded onto a homemade MoO

support, using a wetness impregnation method. (To synthesize MoO

, an appropriate amount of ammonium paramolybdate was dissolved into pure water, adjusting the pH of the solution to 3.7. The solution underwent ultrasonication for 2 hours. The precipitates thus generated were separated by evaporation of solvent and dried at 60 °C under a vacuum overnight. The precipitates were then grinded into powder and calcined in air at 500 °C for 4 hours.) After being dried at room temperature under vacuum, the sample was calcined at 500 °C for 4 hours. For Pt/α-MoC, the calcined Pt/MoO

was carburized using the same procedure as for the synthesis of β-Mo

C. For Pt/MoC-2, MoO

impregnated with H

PtCl

was carburized directly without calcination in air at 500 °C.
2%Pt/MoC-3 catalysts
. An appropriate amount of H

PtCl

•6H

O aqueous solution was added into the ammonium paramolybdate solution dropwise under stirring. A yellow precipitant was thus generated. The solvent was evaporated at 90 °C and the precipitant was dried at 120 °C for 3 hours to ensure that the powder was dried

. Then the sample was carburized (as for β-Mo

C) directly to obtain 2%Pt/MoC-3.
2%Pt/Al

O

and 2%Pt/TiO

. These reference catalysts were synthesized using wet impregnation of H

PtCl

•6H

O over commercial Al

O

and TiO

supports

. The slurry was stirred for 3 hours in air to remove the liquid, using the rotary evaporator under vacuum at 35 °C. The material was dried at 120 °C for 3 hours, and then calcined in the muffle oven at 500 °C. The Pt loading is 2%. The catalysts were reduced with H

before catalytic evaluation.
Pt/α-MoC catalysts with different Pt loadings
. Pt/α-MoC catalysts with 2.2 wt%, 3.1 wt%, 5.1 wt% and 7.4 wt% Pt loadings were prepared as for Pt/α-MoC. Samples with 0.2 wt% and 0.7 wt% Pt loading were prepared using the wetness impregnation method with activated α-MoC as the support. The catalysts are denoted
x
%Pt/α-MoC, where
x
denotes the rough weight concentration of Pt (
x
= 0.2, 1, 2, 3, 5 or 7).
Evaluation of catalytic performance
Before their performance was evaluated, all Pt/MoC catalysts were activated in a CH

/H

mixture (15/85 v/v) at 590 °C for 2 hours. The Pt/oxide catalysts were activated in H

flow at 500 °C. After being cooled to room temperature, the activated sample was transferred into de-aerated water in the autoclave under the protection of a N

flow. The sealed autoclave was purged using 2 MPa N

(10 vol% Ar was used as an internal standard) three times. The catalytic reactions were carried out at 190 °C (the pressure of the system was as high as 6 MPa), and after the reaction the gas phase was analysed using an Agilent 7820 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). We quantified the gas-phase concentration of H

, CO and CH

; however, we could not accurately determine the concentration of CO

owing to its high solubility in the liquid phase, especially at high pressures. We analysed the liquid-phase products on an Agilent HPLC 1200 using a Prevail carbohydrate ES 5-μm column. To generate the results shown in

, for each cycle, the system was reacted at 190 °C for 1.25 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, the gases were analysed by gas chromatography and then released. Then the system was reheated to 190 °C and reacted for another 1.25-hour cycle. A total of 11 cycles was conducted, with the turnover number reaching 132,166. As regards the observed decline in turnover number per cycle, the possible reasons could be: first, some catalyst particles migrated to the upper part of the reactor during the reaction; or second, the CO

accumulating in the liquid partially suppressed the reaction.
We measured the activity in the methanol (or ethanol or ethylene glycol)-reforming reaction through the amount of H

produced in a certain reaction time. We determined this amount using internal standards and according to the following equations:
where
n
x
is the molar concentration of gas
x
;
f
x
is the response factor of gas
x
, calibrated using a mixture of standards;
A
x
is the measured peak area of gas
x
; and
S
x
is the selectivity for the by-products CO and CH

. The amount of Ar (
n
Ar
) is determined from the partial pressure of Ar (0.2 MPa) and the volume of the autoclave (135 ml; the liquid occupies 50 ml of this) using the ideal gas equation. The amount of hydrogen product was determined on the basis of equation . The selectivity for by-products is defined as the molar ratio of the by-product to the main product, H

, in the gas phase.
Estimation of Pt usage for a commercial PEMFC vehicle
The reported hydrogen consumption and range of the Toyota Mirai 2017 vehicle are 1 kg H

per 100 km (at a speed of about 100 km h
−1
; 
) and 500 km, respectively.
To fuel such a vehicle, we propose using hydrogen-reforming stacks to replace high-pressure hydrogen-storage tanks. Methanol and water would be stored separately. Given that the hydrogen fuel cell produces pure water, the water is recyclable. The fuel tank used in traditional cars could be filled with methanol.
Whether this strategy would work in practice is a complicated problem that is related to both science and engineering. Here, we roughly estimate the amount of our 0.2%Pt/α-MoC catalyst that would be required. Further engineering effort is needed in order to optimize the process and bring it to practical application. Given the hydrogen-consumption rate of Mirai (1 kg h
−1
) and the Pt-normalized hydrogen-production rate (18,000 mol H

per mol Pt per hour) of the 0.2%Pt/α-MoC catalyst, around 6 g Pt should meet the requirements of Mirai per hour, which corresponds to approximately 3 kg of 0.2%Pt/α-MoC catalyst.
Structural characterization
X-ray diffraction
. The XRD measurements presented in

were taken at the 17-BM beamline (
λ
= 0.72768 Å) of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. A 3 mg powder sample of each passivated Pt/MoC catalyst was loaded into an amorphous silica tube of diameter 1.0 mm. Two-dimensional XRD patterns were collected with a Perkin Elmer amorphous silicon detector, and the diffraction rings were integrated using the Fit2d code (
http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/FIT2D
). Rietveld refinements of the measured XRD patterns were done using GSAS packages

.
XRD patterns of spent catalysts and of catalysts with different amounts of Pt loading (
Extended Data 
) were collected on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 100 mA, using Cu Kα radiation.
X-ray-absorption fine structure
. Molybdenum K-edge (20,000 eV) XAFS spectra were measured at the BL14W beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in transmission mode, using an ion chamber as the detector. Mo foil, MoO

(Aldrich) and MoO

(Aldrich) were used as standards. Before measurement, all of the samples were activated in a mixture of CH

and H

(20/80 v/v) at 590 °C for 2 hours and carefully sealed under argon protection in a glove box.
Platinum L

-edge (11,564 eV) XAFS spectra were also measured at the BL14W beamline, in fluorescence mode, using a Lytle detector to collect the data. For samples with low metal loading (less than 1%), a 32-channel solid detector was used and multiple parallel scans were applied to achieve high data quality. Pt foil and PtO

(Adamas-beta) were used as standards. The XAFS samples were sealed in a chamber with Kapton windows under argon protection in a glove box after activation.
All XAFS spectra were processed using the Ifeffit package

. The extended XAFS oscillation was fitted according to a back-scattering equation, using FEFF models

generated from crystal structures of MoC (space group
, Mo

C (

) and Pt
.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
. XPS spectra for activated 2%Pt/α-MoC and 0.2%Pt/α-MoC catalysts were collected using an Axis ultraimaging photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical). The passivated catalyst fine powder was made into a small pellet (6 mm diameter) and held on the sample holder. This pellet was then activated in the pretreatment chamber of the XPS spectrometer under a 60 ml min
−1
flow of 15% CH

/H

at 590 °C for 2 hours. After activation, the sample was introduced directly into an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber for XPS measurement at room temperature without exposure to air. The XPS spectra were processed using CasaXPS software (
http://www.casaxps.com/
).
To investigate the surface chemical structure of catalyst after exposure to methanol and water, we activated the pellet of 2%Pt/α-MoC or 0.2%Pt/α-MoC in the pretreatment chamber of the XPS spectrometer at 590 °C under 60 ml min
−1
CH

/H

for 2 hours. After collecting the spectra, we exposed the activated sample to 60 ml min
−1
methanol (0.8 kPa)/water (2.3 kPa)/N

for 60 min at 190 °C. After exposure, the catalyst pellet was transferred into the ultrahigh-vacuum chamber for measurement.
Electron microscopy
STEM characterization was performed on an aberration-corrected Nion UltraSTEM-100, operated at 100 kV (
). The Z-contrast images were collected with an annular dark field detector in the range of 86–200 mrad. The convergence angle was set to 30 mrad. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy was carried out with the same experimental set-up.
Catalyst samples for STEM analysis were prepared by first embedding the catalyst powder in resin and then slicing it into electron-transparent TEM samples using a microtome. The TEM samples were baked at 160 °C under vacuum for 8 hours before loading them into the electron microscope. Control experiments were performed on samples prepared by dry dispersing of catalyst powder directly onto the TEM grid inside a glovebox under argon protection and without vacuum baking. The results are qualitatively the same.
Temperature-programmed surface reactions
Methanol desorption
. We examined the desorption behaviour of methanol on the catalysts using the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) technique. Before analysis, we pretreated about 50 mg of the passivated Pt/MoC-based catalyst in 15% CH

/H

for 2 hours at 590 °C (Pt/oxide supports were pretreated in H

for 2 hours at 500 °C) in a quartz tube, and then cooled the samples to 35 °C. Then the system was purged thoroughly with helium to remove the desorbed molecules. Saturated methanol vapour was then introduced into the system by means of a 80 ml min
−1
helium flow for 15 min from a bubbler that was maintained at 35 °C. After methanol adsorption, the system was further purged by helium flow until no signal of desorbed methanol (

Methanol plus water surface reaction
. The temperature-programmed surface reaction of methanol and water uses the same experimental procedure as that for methanol TPD, except for the adsorption stage: here, a mixture of methanol and water was introduced by 80 ml min
−1
helium flow for 15 min at room temperature. (The amount of methanol and water in the mixture was calculated from the phase diagram for the methanol–water system, and the molarity of methanol aqueous solution was controlled such that

in the gas phase equalled 1.)
Computational details

Methods
. All calculations were performed using the plane-wave-based periodic DFT method, as implemented in the Vienna
ab initio
simulation package (VASP)

,

. The electron–ion interaction was described with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method

,

. The electron-exchange and -correlation energies were treated within the generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional (GGA-PBE)

. The plane-wave basis was set up to 450 eV. Electron smearing was used via the Methfessel–Paxton technique with a smearing width consistent to
σ
= 0.2 eV. The adsorption energies included spin polarization. All transition states were estimated using the climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB)

, and we analysed the stretching frequencies in order to characterize whether a stationary point is a minimum state without imaginary frequency or a transition state with only one imaginary frequency. We also included the van der Waals interaction (D

) in this work.
We calculated the adsorption energy,
E

), where
E
X/slab
is the total energy of the slab (the clean surface) with adsorbates in its equilibrium geometry,
E
slab
is the total energy of the bare slab, and
E
X
is the total energy of the free adsorbates in the gas phase. Therefore, the more negative the adsorption energy, the stronger the adsorption. The activation barrier (or activation energy,

Models
. The calculated lattice constant of a cubic platinum cell (fcc) is 3.9194 Å (experimental constant of 3.9239 Å), and the Pt–Pt bond has a length of 2.771 Å. The calculated lattice constant of a cubic MoC cell (fcc) is 4.3318 Å (experimental of 4.270 Å), and the Mo–Mo bond is 3.063 Å long. For the top views of surface models for α-MoC, Pt and Pt

/α-MoC (
Extended Data 
), we used the same unit cell—namely p(3 × 3)—and 3 × 3 × 1
k
-point sampling. In total, the MoC surface has 27 molybdenum and 27 carbon atoms, of which 9 molybdenum and 18 carbon atoms were fixed; the Pt has 36 platinum atoms, and 18 of these were fixed; the Pt

/MoC has 1 platinum, 27 molybdenum and 27 carbon atoms, of which 9 molybdenum and 18 carbon atoms were fixed, and the platinum coverage was 1/9.
