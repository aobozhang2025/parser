preparation of the Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst. The Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst was prepared by the deposition–precipitation method 27 . In a typical synthesis, 1.0 g of CeO 2 nanorods was dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred at 400 r.p.m. for 1 h; at this stage it is termed CeO 2 aqueous dispersion. Then, 5.6 mg of Rh (III) nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, ~36% Rh basis), which provided ~2.0 mg of Rh metal, was weighed and dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water. The prepared Rh salt solution was slowly introduced into the prepared CeO 2 aqueous dispersion by syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min –1 while the aqueous solution was being stirred, creating an aqueous mixture containing both Rh 3+ and CeO 2 nanorods. This aqueous mixture of Rh 3+ and ceria nanorods was continuously stirred for an additional 3 h. The pH of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradual introduction of ammonium hydroxide solution (Aldrich, 28%) while the aqueous mixture was being stirred, followed by continuous stirring for an additional 5 h. The aqueous mixture was then centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, after which the upper layer was decanted. The solid product thus obtained was dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 250 °C for 2 h to obtain the as-synthesized Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst. The actual loading of Rh on CeO 2 nanorods of the as-synthesized catalyst was measured by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry, and was found to be 0.17 wt%. Thus, either 0.17 wt% Rh/CeO 2 or Rh 1 /CeO 2 is used interchangeably to denote the as-synthesized catalyst in the following sections. Catalytic tests The catalyst (50 mg) was mixed with 300 mg of quartz for SRM. The catalytic performance of the Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst was evaluated in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the temperature range 350–600 °C. A K-type thermal couple was inserted into the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature, which was controlled by a proportional integral derivative controller. The catalyst was pretreated in H 2 (5% in Ar, 20 ml min –1 ) at 500 °C for 1 h before catalysis. Water was introduced by syringe pump, in the form of vapour formed in a vaporization chamber held at 120 °C, before entering the reactor. Water vapour flow rate was kept at twice that of CH 4 (10% in Ar, 20 ml min –1 ), which was premixed with water vapour before being flowed into the reactor. To ensure that water vapour could be fully delivered to the catalyst bed, all stainless steel tubing and valves between the vaporization chamber and reactor were heated and maintained at 120 °C during
