Catalyst synthesis
CeO

nanorods were synthesized by a hydrothermal method as reported previously

,

,

. In a typical synthesis, 1.736 g of Ce(NO

)

·6H

O (Aldrich, 99.99%) was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water then added dropwise to a concentrated NaOH solution, forming a mixed solution of Ce(NO

)

. The concentrated NaOH solution was prepared by dissolving 19.2 g of NaOH (Aldrich, >98%) in 70 ml of deionized water. Then, the mixed solution of Ce(NO

)

was maintained under vigorous stirring for 30 min before being transferred to a Teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 24 h. Following hydrothermal synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The yellow powder thus obtained was washed with deionized water until its pH became neutral. Finally, the powder was dried at 60 °C in air for 10 h. This sample of CeO

nanorod was used as a support in the following preparation of the Rh

/CeO

catalyst.
The Rh

/CeO

catalyst was prepared by the deposition–precipitation method

. In a typical synthesis, 1.0 g of CeO

nanorods was dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred at 400 r.p.m. for 1 h; at this stage it is termed CeO

aqueous dispersion. Then, 5.6 mg of Rh (III) nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, ~36% Rh basis), which provided ~2.0 mg of Rh metal, was weighed and dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water. The prepared Rh salt solution was slowly introduced into the prepared CeO

aqueous dispersion by syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min
–1
while the aqueous solution was being stirred, creating an aqueous mixture containing both Rh
3+
and CeO

nanorods. This aqueous mixture of Rh
3+
and ceria nanorods was continuously stirred for an additional 3 h. The pH of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradual introduction of ammonium hydroxide solution (Aldrich, 28%) while the aqueous mixture was being stirred, followed by continuous stirring for an additional 5 h. The aqueous mixture was then centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, after which the upper layer was decanted. The solid product thus obtained was dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 250 °C for 2 h to obtain the as-synthesized Rh

/CeO

catalyst. The actual loading of Rh on CeO

nanorods of the as-synthesized catalyst was measured by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry, and was found to be 0.17 wt%. Thus, either 0.17 wt% Rh/CeO

or Rh

/CeO

is used interchangeably to denote the as-synthesized catalyst in the following sections.
Catalytic tests
The catalyst (50 mg) was mixed with 300 mg of quartz for SRM. The catalytic performance of the Rh

/CeO

catalyst was evaluated in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the temperature range 350–600 °C. A K-type thermal couple was inserted into the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature, which was controlled by a proportional integral derivative controller. The catalyst was pretreated in H

(5% in Ar, 20 ml min
–1
) at 500 °C for 1 h before catalysis. Water was introduced by syringe pump, in the form of vapour formed in a vaporization chamber held at 120 °C, before entering the reactor. Water vapour flow rate was kept at twice that of CH

(10% in Ar, 20 ml min
–1
), which was premixed with water vapour before being flowed into the reactor. To ensure that water vapour could be fully delivered to the catalyst bed, all stainless steel tubing and valves between the vaporization chamber and reactor were heated and maintained at 120 °C during evaluation of catalytic performance. The products were analysed by an online gas chromatograph equipped with a Hayasep-D column and thermal conductivity detector. The conversion of CH

and yield to H

was evaluated as follows, with
\([{{\mathrm{CH}}}_{4}]_{{\mathrm{in}}}\)
,
\([{{\mathrm{CH}}}_{4}]_{{\mathrm{out}}}\)
and
\([{{\mathrm{H}}}_{2}]_{{\mathrm{out}}}\)
representing CH

concentration at the reactor inlet and CH

and H

concentrations at the reactor outlet, respectively.
$${\mathrm{Conversion}}\left( {\rm{CH}_{4}} \right) = \frac{{[{\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{in} - [{\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{out}}}{{[{\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{in}}} \times 100{{{\mathrm{\% }}}}$$

$${\rm{Yield}}\left( {{\rm{H}_{2}}} \right) = \frac{{\frac{1}{3}[{\rm{H}_{2}}]_{out}}}{{[{\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{in}}} \times 100{{{\mathrm{\% }}}}$$

Catalyst characterization
In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments were mainly performed on beamline BL36XU at SPring-8. The Rh K-edge signal was collected under fluorescence mode by a Ge detector. Data were calibrated, merged and analysed using Athena and Artemis software packages with the standard protocol

. For in situ experiments, the catalyst powder was loaded in a capillary quartz tube cell

. The gas was then introduced into the cell, with flow rate controlled by mass flow controllers. In terms of reduction, 20 ml min
–1
5% H

was introduced to the reactor. In regard to catalysis, the composition of the SRM reactant mixture was CH

(2.5 ml min
–1
), He (22.5 ml min
–1
) and water vapour. The cell was heated, then maintained at the desired temperature for 30 min in a flow of 5% H

in He for the reduction or in a flow of the reactant mixture for SRM, then the Rh K-edge spectrum was collected in situ in the flowing gas at about 150 °C. For the fitting of Fourier-transformed EXAFS data, CN, distance (Å) and Debye–Waller factor (
σ

) were set as variables. WT analysis of EXAFS data was performed with the HAMA Fortran package from the ERSF website. Parameters used in these analyses were the Morlet function,
σ
= 1 and
κ
= 5 (Supplementary Note

).
Surface chemistry of the catalyst under reduction and catalysis conditions was tracked with a commercial AP-XPS system

. A reaction cell was assembled with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source and an energy analyser with precise geometry. The mixture of reactant gases at Torr pressure, with the ratio of partial pressure of CH

and H

O vapour at 1:2, was introduced to the reaction cell through a gas manifold maintained at a 120–150 °C for delivery of water vapour to the reaction cell. The partial pressures of CH

and H

O (vapour) were 0.5 and 1.0 Torr, respectively. The total flow rate of gas mixture entering the in situ reaction cell was ~4 ml min
–1
(
). The total pressure of reactant gases in the reaction cell was the average value of those measured by one capacitance gauge located between the gas manifold and tubing to the entrance port of the reaction cell, and by another placed between the exit port tubing of the reaction cell. XPS data were analysed using CasaXPS software. All spectrum peaks were calibrated by the Au 4
f
7/2
peak to 84.0 eV. Ce 3d spectra were deconvoluted into ten components, whereas six peaks at 882.6, 889.0, 898.6, 900.9, 907.7 and 916.9 eV are assigned to v, vʺ, vʹʺ, u, uʺ and uʹʺ of Ce
4+
, respectively while four at 880.6, 885.2, 899.2 and 904.0 eV were assigned to v
o
, vʹ, u
o
and uʹ of Ce
3+
, respectively

.
DRIFTS spectra of CO molecules absorbed on the catalyst using guest CO source were collected on a Thermo-Fisher Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer using an MCT/A detector with a spectrum resolution of 4 cm
−1
and integrated with a diffuse reflectance reaction cell (Praying Mantis high-temperature reaction cell) at our collaborators’ laboratories at Fuzhou University (FZU). A home-made gas inlet system, including a six-way valve, was used to perform transient studies. Here, we describe this as an ex situ study to distinguish it from the operando studies described below. The purpose of this ex situ study was to identify the chemical state and dispersion of Rh atoms of the as-synthesized catalyst, 0.17 wt%Rh/CeO

. In this ex situ study, the catalyst was mounted in the cell without dilution and was pretreated in a helium flow (99.999%) to remove surface adsorbates before the experiment. Different from these ex situ DRIFTS studies, operando DRIFTS experiments were performed to identify the CO stretching frequency of active sites of the catalyst formed during SRM catalysis and whether these active sites could restructure under different CO partial pressures. The experimental protocol is summarized in Supplementary Note

.
The morphology, size and distribution of single atoms of as-prepared 0.17 wt%Rh/CeO

samples and samples with different pretreatment or after catalysis were examined with advanced TEM instruments at our collaborators’ laboratories, including FZU (Supplementary Note

). In a typical sample preparation, 10 mg of catalyst powder was dispersed in 50 ml of anhydrous ethanol and sonicated for 5 min. Then, 50 μl of the liquid suspension was dropcast on a copper mesh (300-mesh) with carbon nanofilm. Copper mesh and sample were dried overnight before loading on the sample stage for TEM. The morphology and lattice fringes of ceria were then characterized.
DFT calculations
Periodic DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) v.5.4.1 (refs.

,

,

). Exchange correlation energy was calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PDE) functional

. Spin polarization was used in all calculations. A dipole correction in the
z
direction was used for surface calculations. The projector-augmented wave method was used to describe core electrons

,

. Kohn–Sham orbitals were expanded using a set of plane waves with kinetic energy of up to 600 eV. The electronic structure was considered converged when the electronic energy difference between consecutive self-consistent field (SCF) steps fell <10
−6
eV. Surface and molecular structures were considered converged when Hellmann–Feynman forces on atoms fell <0.02 eV Å
–1
. To correct for the self-interaction error of Ce 4
f
electrons, a Hubbard-like on-site repulsion term was added using the approach of Dudarev et al. (DFT +
U
), with an effective Hubbard
U
value (
U
eff
) of 4.5 eV

,

. Using a parabolic equation of state, the lattice parameter of CeO

was found to be 5.502 Å, close to reported values

.
In total, (2 × 2), (√7 × √7), (3 × 3), (3 × √7) and (4 × 4) unit cells of CeO

 containing three O-Ce-O tri-layers were used in the calculations

,

,

. For these periodicities, the Brillouin zone was sampled using (3 × 3 × 1), (3 × 3 × 1), (2 × 2 × 1), (2 × 2 × 1) and (2 × 2 × 1) gamma-point-centred
k
-meshes, respectively

. The sensitivity of stable surface structures regarding the choice of
U
eff
was assessed by calculations using a different
U
eff
value (3.67 eV) benchmarked against single-point calculations with the HSE06 hybrid functional

,

. Single-point HSE06 calculations were performed from converged PBE +
U
(
U
eff
= 4.5 eV) geometries. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a twofold-reduced (VASP commands: NKREDX = 2, NKREDY = 2), gamma-point-centred (2 × 2 × 1) mesh

. The (3 × 3) cell was used to simulate Rh active sites. The bottom tri-layer was constrained to bulk positions in structural optimizations.
Vibrational modes were calculated using the finite difference method with a step size of 0.015 Å. Factors of 0.9828 and 1.0086 were multiplied with OH and CO stretching modes, respectively, when comparing calculated vibrational frequencies to experimental values. Core-level shift (CLS) calculations were performed using both the initial state approximation (ISA) and final state approximation (FSA). In the ISA, the vacuum-aligned Rh 3d eigen energies are directly compared to each other. Lowering Rh 3d eigen energy results in a positive CLS. In the FSA, one 3d electron is assumed to be excited by absorption of the incident photon. The core electron binding energy (
E
CL
) is defined as
E
CL
=
E
(N – 1) –
E
(N), where
E
(N – 1) is the energy of the assessed structure after excitation and
E
(N) is that before excitation

. The final state CLS is computed by taking the difference between the
E
CL
of the assessed structure and that of a Rh atom in the third layer below the surface of a seven-layer (3 × 3) Rh slab. For reference, according to FSA the CLS of a bulk-like Rh
3+
ion below the Rh

O

 surface is 0.99 eV.
Modelling the ceria surface and Rh active sites
The most stable CeO

 surface structure under reaction conditions was determined by minimization of surface free energy under the reaction gas environment 
and Supplementary 
)

,

. The Ce
3+
:Ce
4+
ratio was limited to 1:1 in the two outermost CeO

tri-layers, to simulate surface reduction. Surface and subsurface O
vac
and adsorbed H on surface O were included as potential surface motifs. Bulk CeO

and gases H

and H

O were used as Ce, H and O reservoirs, respectively, in calculation of surface free energy (Supplementary Note

). Simulated Rh active sites were compared to each other by their Gibbs free energy of formation, normalized by each site’s Rh nuclearity

,

. For a given Rh site, the hydroxylated CeO

 surface, H

gas, H

O gas, CO gas and hypothetical supported Rh

clusters were chosen as the Ce, H, O, C and Rh reservoirs, respectively (Supplementary Note

).
The thermodynamically controlled assumption of the CeO

 surface structure was made based on reported experimental observations and reported reaction barriers of elementary redox processes

,

,

. Reduced CeO

 surfaces in (3 × 3) periodicity were searched based on the following five rules developed from observations in the literature and patterns found for representative surfaces

,

,

,

,

,

,

,

,

,

. First, using the
s-xyz-w
notation of Murgida et al.

, the most stable O
vac
-containing surfaces should contain minimal
x
+
y
+
z
and
w
. Second, when OH groups and O
vac
coexist, the two prefer to segregate. Third, when multiple vacancies are present, Ce
3+
ions prefer to cluster near a single vacancy. Fourth, Ce
3+
ions prefer to localize near OH groups. Fifth, Ce
3+
ions near an O
vac
prefer to stay out of the O
vac
first coordination shell.
For a given stoichiometry, all structure combinations were first generated without considering the arrangement of Ce
3+
ions, sorted by rules 1 and 2 and optimized without specification of initial magnetic moments. The most stable structures found using this method were selected, and favourable Ce
3+
localization patterns were generated and optimized using rules 3, 4 and 5. In this set of calculations, a set of plane waves with kinetic energy up to 400 eV was used, the Brillouin zone was sampled using only the gamma point, the electronic energy difference between consecutive SCF steps was converged to 10
−5
eV and forces on atoms were converged to <0.05 eV Å
–1
.
The Rh active sites were searched by first computing the ligand-free Rh single-atom or cluster-binding sites on the fully hydroxylated surface, then checking potential CO/H ligand configurations on the stable Rh sites. A small representative set of OH-liganded Rh

, Rh

and Rh

structures were also optimized, but we did not find them to be as stable as CO- or H-liganded Rh single atoms and clusters. In this set of calculations, a set of plane waves with kinetic energy up to 450 eV was used, the electronic energy difference between consecutive SCF steps was converged to 10
−6
eV and forces on atoms were converged to <0.05 eV Å
–1
.
The surface energy or Gibbs free energy of formation of each structure consists of the translational and rotational components of their gas constituents, their vibrational components and that of corresponding surface motifs (Supplementary Note

and Supplementary Figs.

–

). For supported Rh sites, the configurational entropy of Rh (Supplementary Note

and Supplementary 
), the chemical potential of Rh atoms (Supplementary Note

and Supplementary Figs.

and

) and a back-bonding-based penalty for the adsorption energy of CO (Supplementary Note

and Supplementary Figs.

and

) were also included.
Vibrational contributions to Gibbs free energy were computed in two ways (Supplementary Note

). In the screening of CeO

surface structures and supported Rh sites, and the construction of Figs.

and

, vibrational contributions were estimated based on the formation of six types of motif: surface and subsurface O vacancies, H adsorbed on surface O, H adsorbed on Rh and CO adsorbed on Rh pointing towards or away from the surface. The average margin of error of this approach was up to
k
B
T
per motif based on harmonic oscillator approximation (Supplementary 
). To construct the final
T
/
P
CO
stability diagram of Rh sites 
), harmonic oscillator approximation was used instead.
Rh

was chosen as the Rh chemical potential reference due its resemblance to the Rh coordination environment determined by EXAFS after H

pretreatment

. Rh chemical potential was computed based on the cohesive energy of the Rh

cluster, its Gibbs free energy of adsorption and the configurational entropy of Rh

clusters (Supplementary Note

).
It is well known that the PBE functional overpredicts the strength of transition metal d-state-CO 2π* orbital back bonding

. Many methods have been employed to correct this problem

,

,

. Here, the singlet-triplet transition energy (Δ
E
ST
)-based method of Sumaria et al.

was developed and employed for Rh active sites, where a linear trendline was fitted between CO adsorption energy correction and relaxed C-O bond length (Supplementary Note

)

. CO adsorption energy correction brings values closer to those obtained from higher-level calculations
