Catalyst synthesis
Synthesis and processing
Abstract
Transition-metal single-atom catalysts present extraordinary activity per metal atomic site, but suffer from low metal-atom densities (typically less than 5 wt% or 1 at.%), which limits their overall catalytic performance. Here we report a general method for the synthesis of single-atom catalysts with high transition-metal-atom loadings of up to 40 wt% or 3.8 at.%, representing several-fold improvements compared to benchmarks in the literature. Graphene quantum dots, later interweaved into a carbon matrix, were used as a support, providing numerous anchoring sites and thus facilitating the generation of high densities of transition-metal atoms with sufficient spacing between the metal atoms to avoid aggregation. A significant increase in activity in electrochemical CO

reduction (used as a representative reaction) was demonstrated on a Ni single-atom catalyst with increased Ni loading.

Synthesis of functionalized GQDs
A modified molecular fusion route was employed to synthesize well-crystallized GQDs–NH

and

). Obviously, the GQDs with different particle sizes and functional groups could affect the metal loading of single-atom catalysts (details in Supplementary Figs.

and

). With the decreasing of the size of GQDs, the concentration of the surface functional group will be increased due to its enhanced surface/volume ratio and thus lead to a higher concentration of anchored single metal atoms. So, theoretically, the smaller it is, the better. However, if the size of GQDs is too small, effective steric hindrance cannot be provided to prevent the agglomeration of metal sites between different GQDs. The optimized size of the GQDs is within ~5–10 nm in our case. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the as-prepared GQDs shows a high nitrogen content of 10.8 at.% (Supplementary

Synthesis of Ir single-atom catalyst
We then use the as-obtained GQDs–NH

solution to synthesize the Ir–N–C catalyst with varied iridium loadings 
). Specifically, different volumes of IrCl

stock solution (5 milligrams per millilitre) were first added into 30 millilitres of GQDs–NH

solution (1 milligram per millilitre), henceforth referred to as Ir–N–C-

show the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the GQDs–NH

with 7 millilitres of IrCl

solution after freeze drying, indicating a crosslinking and self-assembly process from well-dispersed GQDs–NH

to layered bulk carbon structures, which agrees with previous reports

,

. This layered morphology was maintained after pyrolysis at 500 °C in argon, resulting in the Ir–N–C-7 final product (

Methods
, 
and Supplementary 
). Cl ligands were completely removed during this pyrolysis step as confirmed by XPS (Supplementary 
). The X-ray diffraction patterns of Ir–N–C catalysts with different iridium loadings show similar features of two broad peaks at approximately 19° and 38° 
), suggesting the formation of amorphous bulk carbon from GQD assembly after pyrolysis. No metallic iridium peaks were observed in Ir–N–C catalysts until ~60 wt% iridium loading (Ir–N–C-15), implying that high-loading atomically dispersed iridium catalyst could be obtained. Iridium quantification from XPS 
) reveals a quasi-linear increasing of iridium content from Ir–N–C-1 to Ir–N–C-7, followed by a nonlinear change of iridium content from Ir–N–C-8 to Ir–N–C-15 catalyst, which implies that uniform atomically dispersed iridium might be formed until the nominal iridium loading (

Methods
) of ~41 wt% (iridium content in Ir–N–C-7). This observation is consistent with the deconvolution of the high-resolution iridium 4

). Only an oxidized iridium specie in the form of Ir

(iridium 4

f
7/2
peak at 60.8 eV) from Ir–N–C-8 to Ir–N–C-15 (
). It is worthwhile to note that the oxidation state of iridium in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst is very close to that of IrO

(+4), where the iridium 4
f
7/2
peak of IrO

is located at 61.6 eV (
). According to the XPS results, our Ir–N–C-7 catalyst has an iridium loading of 37.6 wt% (3.84 at.%) and nitrogen content of 27.8 at.%, consistent with the nominal iridium loading of ~41 wt%.
Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was performed to investigate the distribution of iridium species at the atomic scale in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst. As illustrated in –d
, densely while atomically dispersed iridium atoms on a highly porous carbon support were observed in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, with no clusters observed. The homogeneously dispersed bright spots are ~0.2 nm in size, matching with the theoretical size of metal atoms. The simultaneous acquisition of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results with the beam positioned on a bright atom, shown in Supplementary 
, revealed Ir, N and C and suggested possible coordination of Ir–N–C. EDS mapping analysis further demonstrates the homogeneous distribution of iridium, nitrogen and carbon (Supplementary 
) and gives an iridium content of 44.5 wt%. More importantly, a wide-range HAADF-STEM screening was performed to confirm that there are no iridium clusters or nanoparticles in high-loading Ir–N–C samples (Supplementary Figs.

and

). However, nanoparticles were observed when the iridium loading was further increased to Ir–N–C-8 (Supplementary 
), agreeing well with the XPS analysis. Considering the limited solubility of iridium in corrosive aqua regia solution, we employed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to accurately obtain the iridium loading in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst of 41.6 ± 2.5 wt% (Supplementary 
). This result is consistent with the estimations by XPS (37.6 wt%) and EDS (44.5 wt%) and the nominal calculation (~41.5 wt%).

With the confirmation of the atomic distribution of Ir down to the subnanometre scale by STEM characterization, we next employed X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) to study the electronic and coordination structures of iridium in high-loading Ir single-atom catalysts, such as the Ir–N–C-7 sample, at the micrometre scale. As shown in the Ir L

-edge XANES spectra (Supplementary 
), the spectrum of Ir–N–C-7 was different from that of Ir foil and very similar to that of IrO

, indicating a higher oxidation state of iridium in Ir–N–C-7. The EXAFS spectra of Ir–N–C-7 catalyst 
) presents a prominent peak at ~1.58 Å, which can be ascribed to the iridium–nitrogen/carbon coordination

. No high-order peaks, such as the iridium–iridium interaction in Ir foil (~2.6 Å) and Ir–O–Ir in IrO

, were observed, confirming that the iridium species in Ir–N–C-7 were dispersed as isolated single atoms. Further EXAFS fitting, as shown in Supplementary 
and Supplementary 
, suggested a possible relative uniform Ir–N

configuration for the Ir sites of Ir–N–C-7 catalyst. Synchrotron-based pair distribution function (PDF) analysis was performed to further demonstrate the homogeneity of Ir–N–C-7 catalyst in the millimetre-scale range. The Ir–N–C-7 powders were loaded into 0.9-millilitre-inner-diameter Kapton capillaries for PDF measurement using an X-ray radiation of wavelength 0.21062 Å. 
and Supplementary 
show the PDF spectra of Ir–N–C-7, suggesting a highly amorphous material with a structural correlation up to only 7 Å. The peaks located at 1.35 and 2.02 Å represent the C–C/N bonds and the Ir–C/N bonds, respectively. No iridium–iridium interaction, which is expected at 2.7 Å, was observed in Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, indicating the atomic dispersion of iridium across the whole range of Ir–N–C-7 single-atom catalyst. The above discussed multi-scale characterization results, taken together, lead to a solid conclusion that Ir single-atom catalyst with a high loading of up to ~40 wt% was successfully synthesized.
To monitor the synthesis transition of the GQDs–NH

/Ir
3+
mixture to the single-atom Ir–N–C-7 catalyst, we first examined the sample using ex-situ X-ray diffraction under different temperatures, which represent different synthesis phases. As shown in Supplementary 
, the GQDs started to get fused at 300 °C to form an amorphous bulk carbon, indicated by the emerging of a broad peak at around 19° as well as the decreasing of the intensity of the GQD peak. The amorphization transition might be due to the heavy incorporation of nitrogen and iridium atoms into the GQD lattice under high temperature. With the temperature further increased, the peak of the GQDs completely disappeared, and two broad peaks at approximately 19° and 38° (Supplementary 
) emerged, suggesting the full formation of amorphous bulk carbon from GQD assembly after pyrolysis. No metallic iridium peaks were observed in Ir–N–C-7 catalysts. Ex-situ XPS study (Supplementary 
) reveals that the oxidation state of Ir gradually increases from 300 °C to 500 °C, which also implies that the Ir
3+
stabilized by the amine functional group in the GQDs–NH

/Ir
3+
mixture gradually coordinated with the lattice nitrogen and carbon to form more stable Ir–N
a
–C motif. A scheme (Supplementary 
) was employed to illustrate the synthesis of high-loading Ir–N–C-7 catalyst. Initially, the Ir
3+
atoms were stably absorbed on the GQDs–NH

surface by the strong chelation/complexation effect between metal cations and amine groups. With the temperature continuing to increase, the small GQDs started to interconnect and then to form a three-dimensional bulk carbon that can be directly used for practical applications. Simultaneously, the surface nitrogen will be in-situ doped into the GQD lattice under high temperature, and thus help to trap the isolated Ir atoms to form the Ir–N
a
–C coordination. As a result, the oxidation state of Ir will increase after the formation of the Ir–N
a
–C motif. The thermal stability of the GQDs is the key point to avoid the formation of Ir nanoclusters or particles. While the heavy incorporation of nitrogen and iridium atoms leads to less lattice periodicity of GQDs, they do not undergo a complete deconstruction during pyrolysis, which was demonstrated by the TEM study under different temperatures (Supplementary 
). Thus, it can provide a stable and large spacing between TM atoms to avoid aggregation.
We further demonstrated that another carbon substrate with similar high nitrogen dopants cannot deliver the same products. Specifically, we first synthesized nitrogen-doped graphene using graphene oxide (GO) as the starting material (Supplementary 
). The as-synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon (GO–NH

) shows a very high nitrogen content of ~20 at.% (Supplementary 
). The GO–NH

was used as the support to synthesize the Ir single-atom catalyst, following the same process as for Ir–N–C-7 synthesis. However, we found that even if the loading of Ir is less than 10 wt%, nanoparticles will be formed (Supplementary 
), showing obvious metallic Ir X-ray diffraction peaks. This observation reveals that a high-loading Ir single-atom catalyst could not be obtained using the carbon support with only a high level of nitrogen dopant, demonstrating the unique role of the GQDs. While GO–NH

is as stable as GQDs during pyrolysis, it shows a very low surface-to-volume ratio, providing limited anchor sites. As the intermediate carbon support, GQDs are unique since they can supply numerous surface anchoring sites for large loadings of isolated metal atoms, and they are stable enough during pyrolysis to prevent the isolated atom aggregation.

Synthesis of other single-atom catalysts
To validate if our GQD-assisted synthesis method can be extended to synthesize other TM single-atom catalysts with high metal loadings, we first replaced the iridium precursor with platinum to prepare Pt–N–C single-atom catalysts. 
and Supplementary 
exhibit the HAADF-STEM images of Pt–N–C-6 catalyst with a nominal platinum content of ~32.3 wt% (

Methods
). Densely dispersed Pt single atoms were observed without any nanoclusters or particles, suggesting the successful extension from iridium to different noble metal centres. The EDS elemental mapping shows the uniform distribution of platinum, nitrogen and carbon in Pt–N–C-6 (Supplementary 
). The EELS and EDS scans on a single platinum site (Supplementary 
) further reveal the expected platinum, nitrogen and carbon signals in Pt–N–C-6. The deconvolution of platinum 4

spectra (Supplementary

Other TM centres beyond noble metals, represented by nickel, were also prepared via the same synthesis method. As shown in
, the as-synthesized Ni–N–C-3 catalyst presents atomically dispersed nickel without observable nickel clusters. The colocation of nickel and nitrogen on the carbon support was also demonstrated by the STEM–EELS point spectrum 
). The highest nickel single-atom loading we can obtain is approximately 15 wt% (3.6 at.%; Supplementary 
) in Ni–N–C-3, which is at least twofold higher than previously reported Ni single-atom catalysts 
). As the nickel species can be readily dissolved in aqua regia solution, we then used inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry to double confirm the nickel atom loading. As a result, the inductively coupled plasma gives a nickel content of 15.4 ± 0.4 wt% for Ni–N–C-3, which is in good agreement with XPS and TGA estimations, confirming the high accuracy of the XPS and TGA methods for single-atom loading quantification. The Ni K-edge XANES spectra in 
show that the oxidation state of Ni in as-prepared Ni–N–C is located between 0 and +2, which is consistent with XPS analysis (Supplementary

and Supplementary 
) further confirms the nickel single-atom dispersion across the whole sample region. The above results confirm that tuning the metal active site is routinely achievable, demonstrating the generality of our synthetic strategy for high-loading TM single-atom catalysts.

. As a representative case study, we compare the CO

reduction performances on as-prepared Ni–N–C-1.5 (~7.5 wt% Ni) and Ni–N–C-3 (~15 wt% Ni) catalysts with the same catalyst mass loading but different nickel atom loadings. To overcome the CO

diffusion limitation in the H-cell reactor and the flooding issue of the gas diffusion electrode in the flow cell reactor, we utilized an anion-exchange membrane electrode assembly (

Methods
) to investigate the impact of Ni single-atom loading on CO

reduction performance

. As shown in 
and Supplementary 
, while both ~7.5 wt% Ni–N–C-1.5 and ~15 wt% Ni–N–C-3 show an outstanding CO selectivity of over 90%, their activities differ dramatically. Specifically, under a cell voltage of ~2.55 V, ~15 wt% Ni–N–C-3 catalyst can deliver a CO partial current of 122 mA cm
−2
, which represents a 2.5-fold improvement from ~7.5 wt% Ni–N–C-1.5 
). In addition, we performed HADDF-STEM analysis on the postcatalysed Ni–N–C-3 catalyst (Supplementary 
). We did not observe any agglomeration during the CO

reduction reaction, demonstrating the good stability of our high-loading single-atom catalysts. This result clearly demonstrates the advantage of high single-atom loadings in improving single-atom catalysis.
Pushing the metal loading in single-atom catalysts to the limit will play a critical role in the catalysts’ practical applications. Our GQD-assisted synthesis strategy sets up a limit of TM single-atom density before the formation of clusters or nanoparticles. Fine tuning of the quantum dot functional group, TM coordination environment and TM centre will be future directions to further increase the single-atom loading and improve the catalytic performances of single-atom catalysts in different reaction applications.

Typically, 8 grams of pyrene (Sigma, purity >98%) was nitrated into trinitropyrene in 640 millilitres of concentrated HNO

(70%, Sigma) at 80 °C under refluxing and stirring for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was washed to neutral pH using deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ) by centrifuging. The resultant yellow 1,3,6-trinitropyrene was then dried under vacuum at room temperature. Next, 1.2 grams of dried 1,3,6-trinitropyrene powder were dispersed into a solution containing 220 millilitres of DI water and 20 millilitres of concentrated ammonia solution (30%, Sigma). The above mixture was ultrasonicated in ice water using a batch sonicator for 4 h. Sixty millilitres of the homogeneous suspension were transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 millilitres). The four autoclaves (total 240 millilitres mixture solution) were heated at 200 °C for 10 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, all the product-containing solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm microporous membrane to remove insoluble carbon product and further concentrated to ~90 millilitres by rotation drying. The concentrated solution was dialysed in a dialysis bag (retained molecular weight, ~12–14 kDa, Innovating Science) for two days to remove contamination and unfused small molecules. The concentration of purified GQDs–NH

was replaced using 30 milligrams of GQDs–OH. To prepare GQDs–OH, all the processes are the same as in the preparation of GQDs–NH

except 240 millilitres of 0.2 M NaOH solution was used to replace the previous ammonia solution (220 millilitres of DI plus 20 millilitres of concentrated ammonia). This is because the heavily nitrogen-doped carbon matrix will also promote the hydrogen evolution reaction. The as-prepared Ni–N–C-1.5 (~7.5 wt% Ni) and Ni–N–C-3 (~15 wt% Ni) single-atom catalysts from GQDs–OH were also verified using STEM.

Typically, 32 mg of as-prepared Ni–N–C-3 (or Ni–N–C-1.5) powder and 8 mg of carbon black (Vulcan XC-72, Fuel Cell Store) were mixed with 4 ml of isopropanol and 160 µl of alkaline ionomer binder solution (Dioxide Materials, 5%) and sonicated for 10 min to obtain a homogeneous ink. Then, all the ink was air-brushed onto the 5 × 5 cm

Sigracet 35 BC (Fuel Cell Store) gas diffusion layer electrode. Then 4 cm

of the catalyst-coated gas diffusion layer electrode was cut to be used as a CO

reduction reaction cathode with a catalyst loading of ~0.5 mg cm
−2
. An IrO

electrode (Dioxide Materials) was used as an oxygen evolution reaction anode. A polystyrene methyl methylimidazolium chloride anion-exchange membrane (PSMIM, Dioxide Materials) was sandwiched by the two gas diffusion layer electrodes to separate the chambers. On the cathode side, a titanium gas flow channel supplied 30 sccm humidified CO

while the anode was circulated with 0.5 M KOH electrolyte at 3 ml min
−1
flow rate. The cell voltages in 
and H were recorded with 85% iR-correction (current × resistance compensation).
In order to quantify the gas products during electrolysis, CO

gas (Airgas, 99.995%) was delivered into the cathodic compartment at a rate of 30.0 sccm and vented into a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a combination of molecular sieve 5A, HayeSep Q, HayeSep T and HayeSep N columns. A thermal conductivity detector was mainly used to quantify H

concentration, and a flame ionization detector with a methanizer was used to quantitatively analyse CO content and/or any other alkane species. The partial current density for a given product was calculated as follows:
$$j_i = x_i \times v \times \frac{{n_i{F}p_{\mathrm{o}}}}{RT} \times ({\mathrm{electrode}}\,{\mathrm{area}})^{ - 1}$$
where
x
i
is the volume fraction of a certain product determined by online gas chromatograph referenced to calibration curves from the standard gas sample (Airgas),
v
is the flow rate of 30.0 sccm,
n
i
is the number of electrons involved,
p
o
= 101.3 kPa,
F
is the Faradaic constant, the temperature
T
= 298 K and
R
is the gas constant. The corresponding Faradaic efficiency at each potential is calculated by
\({\mathrm{FE}} = \frac{{j_i}}{{j_{\mathrm{total}}}} \times 100\%\)
, where
j
total
is the total current density.
