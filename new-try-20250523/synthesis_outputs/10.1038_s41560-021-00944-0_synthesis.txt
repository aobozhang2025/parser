Preparation of Ti
–rGO and rGO
The Ti

–rGO SAM sample was prepared via chemisorption route. First, 400 mg of graphite oxide was dispersed into 120 ml of isopropanol. Then, 20 μl of organic Ti salt (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)) was added into the above solution with continuous magnetic stirring, followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 1 h and magnetic stirring for 20 h. Afterwards, the above dispersion solution was centrifuged and the resulting precipitation was dried at 85 °C in vacuum for 24 h. Thereafter, the obtained powder was calcinated at 550 °C for 2 h in a high-purity N

atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the fluffy black powder was Ti

–rGO SAM. Likewise, rGO could be obtained by the same steps without adding organic Ti salt.
Fabrication of modular C-PSCs
Here, 10 mg of carbon material (rGO or Ti

–rGO) was dispersed into 20 ml of isopropanol solution, followed by ball-milling for 12 h. The dispersion slurry for spraying was obtained. FTO glasses were etched with zinc powder and 4 M HCl, rinsed with cleaning fluid, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol, respectively.

When the FTO glass was preheated to 450 °C, the compact TiO

layer was deposited on the FTO glass by a spray pyrolysis method (the carrier gas is O

). The precursor solution of the compact TiO

layer (c-TiO

) was diluted 600 μl of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) and 400 μl of acetyl acetone with 9 ml of ethanol. After spray pyrolysis, the FTO/c-TiO

was sintered at 450 °C for 10 min before cooling down to room temperature. After that, mesoporous TiO

(mp-TiO

) was deposited on the c-TiO

layer by spin coating for 20 s at 4,000 r.p.m. The precursor solution of m-TiO

was diluted the commercial TiO

paste (30NRD, Dyesol) with ethanol at a weight ratio of 1:6. The FTO/c-TiO

/mp-TiO

was heated at 450 °C for 30 min under dry air flow. To deposit the perovskite layer, one-step spin-coating method was adopted to prepare the Cs

perovskite layer with 5% excess of PbI

in 1 ml of mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1 volume ratio). Subsequently, 120 μl of perovskite solution was spin coated on the ETL via a two-step spin-coating programme with 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s with an acceleration rate of 200 r.p.m. s

and 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s with an acceleration rate of 2,000 r.p.m. s

, respectively. Then 300 μl of antisolvent (chlorobenzene) was dropped on the spinning substrates 15 s before the end of programme, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 20 min.

sol for the ETL of PSCs. The prepared precursor was spin coated on the FTO glass at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by thermal treatment at 80 °C for 1 h in the air. After that, the as-deposited SnO

ETL was treated with UV-Ozoneor 20 min. To deposit the perovskite layer, one-step spin-coating method was adopted to prepare the Cs

perovskite layer. Typically, FAI (1 M), PbI

(1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M) and PbBr

(0.2 M) were dissolved in 1 ml of mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1 volume ratio), and then stirred at 60 °C for 2 h. Next, 1 M CsI DMSO solution was added to the above perovskite precursor solution with a volume ratio of 5:95. Subsequently, 120 μl of perovskite solution was spin coated on the ETL via a two-step spin-coating programme with 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 6,000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. Then 300 μl of antisolvent (α,α,α-trifluorotoluene) was dropped on the spinning substrates 20 s before the end of programme, followed by annealing at 85 °C for 45 min.
The spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was obtained via adding 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD powder, 29 μl of TBP, 17.5 μl of Li-TFSI acetonitrile solution (520 mg ml
−1
) into chlorobenzene (1 ml). Afterwards, 50 μl of the spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin coated on the above perovskite films at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The semicell was obtained successfully. Then 500 μl of carbon slurry based on rGO or Ti

–rGO was sprayed on the above semicells (FTO/ETL/perovskite/HTL) and FTO substrates on a hotplate at 85 °C to accelerate solvent evaporation. The obtained semicell A (FTO/ETL/perovskite/HTL/carbon) and charge collector B (FTO/carbon) were then assembled into modular C-PSC by being stacked together using retaining clips, and the overall thickness of graphene on two carbon electrodes was compressed to about 2 μm.
Characterizations
The STEM images of Ti

–rGO SAM sample were acquired using a STEM (JEOL ARM-200F) equipped with an aberration corrector (CEOS CESCOR) at the probe side, which was operated at the accelerating voltage of 80 kV. The dwell time per pixel was set to 10–16 μs. The morphologies of samples were characterized by SEM (SU8220) and STEM (F-20, FEI). A double Si-crystal monochromator was adopted for energy selection. The energy was calibrated by the Ti foil.
JV
characteristics of modular C-PSCs were conducted on a digital source meter (Keithley 2450) at the scan speed of 100 mV s
−

. The simulated AM 1.5G sunlight (irradiance equivalent to 100 mW cm
−2
) calibrated by standards Si reference cell (Si photodiode (FDS1010-CAL from Thorlabs) with a KG5 filter, calibrated by Newport) was generated by a solar simulator (Newport Sol 3A). We continuously verify our measurements with PV certification laboratories (Fraunhofer ISE). The modular C-PSCs were masked with a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.09 cm

during
JV
measurement. The stable output of photocurrent and PCE were detected with a digital source meter (Keithley 2450) at a certain bias. The IPCE spectrometry was performed using a commercial apparatus (Aekeo-Ariadne, Cicci Research s.r.l.) with a 300-W Xenon lamp. Stability of the cells were recorded under a white light-emitting diode lamp with biologic MPG2 potentiostat and N

atmosphere. The spectral mismatch between AM 1.5G and the simulated sunlight was calibrated with a Schott K113 Tempax filter.
STEM–EELS measurements and data analysis
The Ti

–rGO powder was uniformly dispersed by sonication in high-purity ethanol, then the solution was dropped onto a 400-mesh lacey-carbon gold grid for the EELS mapping in the STEM mode (STEM–EELS). Before the STEM–EELS measurements, the grid was annealed at 100 °C in a high vacuum chamber of roughly 10
−

mbar overnight to completely remove the ethanol residual as well as any adsorbed vapour. The JEOL JEM ARM-200F equipped with the cold field-emission gun and the ASCOR fifth-order probe-side corrector was applied for the STEM–EELS experiments under 60 kV of accelerating voltage to avoid sample damage. The 30-mrad convergence semi-angle and roughly 120-pA probe current were selected for the optimized information transfer and single-atom sensitivity

. An energy dispersion of 0.25 eV per channel and 91-mrad collection semi-angle in the Gatan Enfinium ER spectrometer were set up with corrected stigmatism up to the third order. Each STEM–EELS map was acquired using 1 ms dwell time (near 1,000 spectra per second) and 0.25 Å pixel size to maintain a relatively low electron dose. The zero-loss peak and core-loss edges were simultaneously recorded for the absolute energy scale. The simultaneous annular dark field signal was acquired using a 93-mrad inner collection semi-angle. The signal-to-noise ratio of the single-pixel spectrum in the STEM–EELS dataset under as-described experimental conditions is low but adequate to distinguish the Ti–L

and –L

edges (fine structures visible when averaged across the whole sampled region). The spectrum background was subtracted using the method of local background averaging and linear combination of two power laws to benefit from the redundant sampling

. Instead of the direct integration of the Ti edges, we carried out principal component analysis first to search for the reference spectrum of Ti

, then non-negative least-square fitting of the spectra dataset by the reference spectrum generated the Ti concentration map of enormously improved contrast.
X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements and data analysis
The Ti K-edge XAFS spectra were collected at BL11B beamline in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Notably, here we adapted a common practice of multiple scans for the XAFS measurements of Ti

–rGO and the average of four scans were collected. Some details of the XAFS measurements and data analysis were as follows: the hard X-ray was monochromatized with Si double-crystal monochromator and the harmonic rejection mirror was used to remove monochromator harmonics. The as-prepared Ti

–rGO sample was first pelletized as disc of 10 mm and the XAFS data were collected in fluorescence mode (Lytle detector) in the energy range from −200 below to 800 eV above the Ti K-edge. The acquired EXAFS data were processed according to the standard procedures using the ATHENA module implemented in the IFEFFIT software packages

. The

were FT to real (
R
) space using a Hanning window (d
k
= 1.0 Å
−

) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. The EXAFS curve-fittings were performed using the ARTEMIS module of IFEFFIT

. Effective backscattering amplitudes

(

bulk. For the Ti–O/C

shells, each of the Debye–Waller factors (

Computational models and methods
Ti

–rGO and rGO computational models were constructed based on 6 × 6 × 1 supercells of graphene, and the box size was 14.76 × 14.76 × 16.70 Å. Neighbouring slabs were separated through a vacuum of 15 Å to avoid interaction. The DFT calculations were performed with projector-augmented wave potentials and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional was implemented by the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package

,

. Relaxations were performed using a conjugate-gradient algorithm. The selected energy convergence was 1 × 10
−4
eV atom and force convergence was 0.05 eV Å. The cut-off energy was set to 400 eV. A Monkhorst–Pack point sampling of 4 × 4 × 1 was adopted. The occupancy of the one-electron states was revealed using Gaussian smearing (SIGMA, 0.05 eV).
J
sc

V
oc
measurement technique
The starting point of the
J
sc
–
V
oc
technique is the single-diode approximation with negligible shunt resistance:
$$J\left( {V,L,R_{\mathrm{s}}} \right) = J_0\left( {1 - {\mathrm{e}}^{\frac{{q(V + R_{\mathrm{s}}J)}}{{nk_{\mathrm{B}}T}}}} \right) + J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}(L)$$

Here,
L
is the light intensity of the simulated sunlight,
J

the dark emission current,
q
the elementary charge,
R
s
the series resistance,
n
the ideality factor,
k
B
the Boltzmann constant and
T
the device temperature.
J
sc
(
L
) and
V
oc
(
L
) are measured for a series of light intensities
L
, which yields a pseudo
JV
curve
\(J_{{\mathrm{s}}c}^ \ast (V)\)
, where
\(J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}^ \ast (V) \equiv J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}(L)\)
with
V
=
V
oc
(
L
). For
R
s
= 0, from equation (

) the following relationships are derived:
$$\begin{array}{l}J\left( {V_{{\mathrm{oc}}}\left( L \right),L,R_{\mathrm{s}} = 0} \right) = 0 \to J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}\left( L \right) = J_0\left( {e^{\frac{{qV_{{\mathrm{oc}}}(L)}}{{nk_{\mathrm{B}}T}}} - 1} \right)\\ J\left( {V,1{\mathrm{sun}},R_{\mathrm{s}} = 0} \right) = J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}\left( {1{\mathrm{sun}}} \right) - J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}^ \ast (V)\end{array}$$

J
(
V
, 1 sun,
R
s
= 0) is the
JV
curve of the device with zero series resistance. In this work we call
J
(
V
,1 sun,
R
s
= 0) the
J
sc
–
V
oc
curve. At
J
MPP
we have the following relationships for the
JV
and the
J
sc
–
V
oc
curves, where for the latter
V

is by definition the voltage at
J
MPP
:
$$\begin{array}{l}J_{{\mathrm{MPP}}} = J\left( {V_{{\mathrm{MPP}}},1{\mathrm{sun}},R_{\mathrm{s}}} \right) = J_0\left( {1 - {\mathrm{e}}^{\frac{{q\left( {V_{{\mathrm{MPP}}} + R_{\mathrm{s}}J_{{\mathrm{MPP}}}} \right)}}{{nk_{\mathrm{B}}T}}}} \right) + J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}\left( {1{\mathrm{sun}}} \right)\\ J_{{\mathrm{MPP}}} = J\left( {V_0,1{\mathrm{sun}},R_{\mathrm{s}} = 0} \right) = J_0\left( {1 - {\mathrm{e}}^{\frac{{qV_0}}{{nk_{\mathrm{B}}T}}}} \right) + J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}\left( {1{\mathrm{sun}}} \right)\\ \to V_{{\mathrm{MPP}}} + R_{\mathrm{s}}J_{{\mathrm{MPP}}} = V_0 \to R_{\mathrm{s}} = (V_0 - V_{{\mathrm{MPP}}})/J_{{\mathrm{MPP}}}\end{array}$$
To determine
R
s
at MPP we have to determine the voltage difference Δ
V
=
V
o
–
V
MPP
of the real
JV
curve and the
J
sc
–
V
oc
curve at
J
MPP
and divide it by
J
MPP
.
Note that this technique is not restricted to devices that follow the singe-diode characteristics. In fact, the
J
sc
–
V
oc
method can be used for any solar cell that follows a characteristics of the form
J
(
V
,
L
,
R
s
) =
J
dark
(
V
,
R
s
) +
J
sc
(
L
). One can also show that this method can even be applied if there is a non-negligible shunt resistance.
