Synthesis of Rh@MEL materials The encapsulation of Rh within MEL zeolitic channels has never been reported previously, to our knowledge, and the syntheses of our new Rh@MEL materials were modified from the precedent one-pot hydrothermal crystallization recipe, in which encapsulation of Pt and Rh into the MFI channels was successfully achieved 26 , 27 . In the representative synthesis of the 0.17Rh@MEL , a gel solution was prepared by dissolving 0.030 g of KOH (0.5 mmol) in 2.32 ml of deionized H 2 O and then mixing with 3.880 g of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (6.0 mmol) and 4.120 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (19.8 mmol). A metal precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.0045 g of Rh(III) chloride hydrate (0.017 mmol) and 100 μl of ethylenediamine in 100 μl of deionized H 2 O. This metal precursor was added dropwise into the gel solution with vigorous stirring. The gel solution was then hydrolysed at 30 °C for 10 h with stirring (500 r.p.m.). The molar composition of the obtained gel was 66.7 (K 2 O):5,282.6 (SiO 2 ):1,600.8 (TBAOH): 6,8921.1 (H 2 O):4.0 (Rh):400.2 (NH 2 CH 2 CH 2 NH 2 ). The resultant yellow solution was transferred into a 50-ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 130 °C for 24 h under static conditions. Following the hydrothermal crystallization, the solid product was isolated by centrifugation and sequentially washed with deionized water and ethanol. Subsequently, it was dried at 80 °C for 12 h in ambient air. The obtained solid sample was further calcined in static air at 560 °C for 5 h and then reduced under a flow of H 2 /Ar mixture at 600 °C for 2 h. The as-prepared sample was denoted 0.17Rh@MEL . Synthesis of Rh OD @MEL materials A CO pretreatment was subsequently conducted to disrupt Rh clusters into isolated atoms and thus generate the atomically dispersed Rh sites on the original 0.17Rh@MEL sample. For details, the 0.17Rh@MEL sample was loaded into quartz tubes and subjected to heating under a continuous flow of CO (0.5 MPa) at 90 °C for 2 h. The Rh loading in the resulting 0.17Rh OD @MEL samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis. The syntheses of 0.05Rh OD @MEL and 0.33Rh OD @MEL were succeeded under identical conditions, except using different amounts of Rh(III) chloride hydrate (0.0012 g and 0.0092 g, respectively) within the previously mentioned synthesis procedure.
