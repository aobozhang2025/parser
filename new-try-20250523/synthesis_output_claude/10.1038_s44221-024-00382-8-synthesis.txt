Kinetics fitting Kinetics of the pollutant degradation data was fitted by the first -order equation which is given as follows: ln(𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶0) =-kt Where, C t is the concentration of pollutants at t time (mg/L), C 0 is the original concentration of contaminants (mg/L), and k is the degradation rate constant (min-1). The apparent rate constant (kobs) is calculated based on the average concentration, and the standard deviation (SD) is determined by treating the kobs as the mean value for its calculation. Text S5. Evaluation of PMS concentration An iodometric method was applied to analyze the concentration of PMS in solution. Specifically, 0.2 mL reaction solution was added into a mixed solution (0.3 g KI, 0.06 g NaHCO 3, and 2.8 mL H 2O) and then analyzed on a UV–vis spectrophotometer. Text S6. Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical analysis tests, including chronopotentiometry and open circuit potential -time, were conducted on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc, USA). The synthesized samples were coated on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) a nd were used as the working electrode. A Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were applied as the counter and reference electrode s, respectively. A sample of 2 mg was mixed with 0.48 mL of isopropanol, 0.48 mL of deionized (DI) water and 40 μ L of 5 wt% Nafion, followed by ultrasonication for 60 min, and the mixed solution was dropped on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The sample/GCE was prepared after repeating the dropping step twice . We used 50 mM Na 2SO 4 as the electrolyte . Text S7. Galvanic oxidation setup In order to validate the direct redox interaction between PMS and phenol on the surface of the catalyst, we undertook galvanic cell experiments using a two -chamber reactor setup. A carbon paper electrode (2 cm × 2 cm) was employed as the substrate for loading the catalyst. Initially, 10 mg of catalyst 6 powder was combined with a mixture comprising 40 uL Nafion solution and 1 mL of isopropanol. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was subjected to 60 min of sonication to ensure formation of a homogeneous ink. A portion of the catalyst ink (0.2 m L) was then evenly applied to one side of the carbon paper and dried at room temperature. Within the galvanic cell system featuring two chambers, one cell was loaded with a solution containing 0.2 mM phenol and 50 mM Na 2SO 4 (as the electrolyte), while the other cell contained a solution of 50 mM Na 2SO 4. Upon initiating the reaction by injecting 0.4 mM PMS into the designated cell, the change in a current during the reaction was continuously monitored using an ammeter. Copper wires were used to connect the two electrodes and the ammeter. Samples were periodically extracted from the phenol -containing cell for subsequent analysis . Text S8. Byproduct analysis. An ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography system (UHPLC, Dionex Ultimate 3000) coupled with a mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Q Exactive) was utilized to analyze the oxidation products. The Atlantis T3 column (100 mm × 3.0 mm, 3.0 μm) was used for chromatographic separation. Detection was performed in negative ESI mode (ESI –). The HPLC operating conditions were: 0.1% formic acid and 5 mM ammonium formate in ultrapure water (mobile phase A), methyl alcohol (mobile phase B), flow rate: 0.3 mL/min, gradient elution program: A: B=65%:35% (0-1 min) , 10%:90% (5 min), 1%:99% (10-15 min), 20 μL injection volume, 30 ℃ column temperature.

Construction of Co 1CNCl/S/cotton columns. The Co 1CNCl/S catalysts were deposited on the cotton via the adsorption process. The catalyst suspensions were prepared by dispersing 50 mg of catalysts into 100 mL ultrapure water and sonicated for 0.5 h, followed by adding 8.5 g cotton. After adsorption, the cotton with catalysts dried at 60 oC. Phenol solution is 5 ppm in this column system. Text S 10. Computational Details . 7 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (V ASP)3,4. The electron -ion potential was described by the projected augmented wave method (PAW)5, and a plane -wave energy cut -off of 450 eV was set in this study. The Perdew -Burk -Ernzerhof (PBE) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to describe the exchange - correlation functional6. The convergence criterion of the force was -0.03 eV/Å and the convergence thresholds for the total energy was 10-5 eV . Since GGA cannot correctly describe strongly correlated systems containing partially filled d subshells, the GGA+U method is applied to describe partially filled d orbitals by taking into account Coulomb and exchange corrections. We used correlation e nergy (U) of 4 eV and exchange energy (J) of 1 eV for transition metal ™ d orbitals. The Brillouin -zone integration was approximated 4×4×1 by a grid using the Monkhorst -Pack k -point mesh. A vacuum space of 15 Å in the Z -direction was chosen to avoid arti ficial interaction. The effect of van der Waals (vdW) interactions was included for weak interaction cases using the semiempirical correction scheme of Becke -Jonson damping, DFT -D3 7. The adsorption energy of *PMS ( ΔE) on the catalyst surface was calculated by ΔE= E(*PMS) – E(slab) - E(PMS) in which E(*PMS), E(slab) and E(PMS) are the total energy of the catalyst slab with adsorbed PMS, the catalyst slab and the energy of PMS, respectively. 8 Supplementary Figures Supplementary .
