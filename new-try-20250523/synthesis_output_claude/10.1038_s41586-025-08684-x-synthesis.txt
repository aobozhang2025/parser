synthesis of the nanosized CeAlO 3 phase We show below our approach to synthesize nanosized crystals of CeAlO 3 (~25 nm crystal size) starting with the 50% ceria/aumina support (CeAl50) that we have used in this work. By aging the sample in the presence of reactants at 900 °C, we did not observe the formation of CeAlO 3. However, treatment at 1,150 °C led to complete transformation of ceria into ~ 25nm CeAlO 3 crystals as evidenced by XRD and microscopy (Supplementary Figures S 39-S46). Supplementary . XRD patterns for three CeAl50 samples and the weight fractions of each crystalline phase calculated from the Rietveld refinement from XRD and the crystallite size of the CeAlO 3 calculated from XRD. 40 Supplementary . HAADF -STEM images of CeAl50 sample after reactive treatment at 1,150 °C. Crystals ~20 -30 nm in size represent CeAlO 3. The lighter contrast phase is the alumina support. 41 Supplementary . HAADF -STEM image and the corresponding EDS map and EDS spectrum for CeAlO 3 nanoparticle. 42 Supplementary . High-resolution HAADF -STEM images of CeAlO 3 nanoparticles and the corresponding FFT, consistent with and zone axis orientations of CeAlO 3. Supplementary . High-resolution HAADF -STEM images of CeAlO 3 particles, revealing well - ordered Ce atom locations which are very different from the disordered 2D Ce xOy domains in our working catalysts. The CeAlO 3 turned out to be almost completely inactive for NO reduction, as demonstrated by our catalytic data ( Supplementary ). Furthermore, infrared 43 spectroscopy with NO probe molecules reveals that the CeAlO 3 is not reactive towards NO ( Supplementary ), unlike Ce xOy clusters on alumina. Supplementary . NO catalytic reduction measurements for CeAlO 3 (~25 nm sized CeAlO 3 crystals formed by reactively treating CeAl50 at 1,150 °C). Conditions: 120 mg catalyst. Total flow 300 ml/min. Concentrations: 490 ppm NO, 1800 ppm CO, ~2.6% H 2O, balanced with N 2. GHSV ~ 150 L/g*hr. Ramp rate 4 ⁰C/min. The panel on the right shows an expanded y axis to show clearly the products which have very low concentrations due to their low activity. 44 Supplementary . Infrared spectra during continuous NO adsorption (2 Torr) at room temperature on CeAlO 3 (~25 nm sized CeAlO 3 crystals formed by reactively treating CeAl50 at 1,150 °C). Before the measure, sample was first pre -treated in CO (1 Torr) at 500 ⁰C. No evidence of N2O evolution is observed (the band at ~2,250 cm-1 is absent), in contrast to Ce xOy clusters on alumina. Thus, the formation of the crystalline ceria -alumina phase (CeAlO 3) only leads to inactive catalyst, which is in contrast to increased activity observed for our reactively treated catalysts that feature Ce xOy domains on the surface of alumina. This is not surprising considering that the unit cell of CeAlO 3 features 12 -coordinate Ce (Supplementary below). Such over -coordination of Ce excludes its participation in catalysis and prevents transformation between Ce 3+ and Ce4+ needed for catalysis. 45 Supplementary . Unit cell of CeAlO 3, showing Ce atom in green, Oxygen atoms in red, Al atoms in blue. These experiments (Figs S 39-S46) provide the compelling evidence that the CeAlO 3 phase cannot account for the observed results for the NO reactivity, instead it is the previously unobserved, highly dispersed ~1 atomic layer thin Ce xOy domains on alumina which are responsible for improved catalytic activity. 46 Supplementary .

Reactive treatment at 800 ⁰C was with 450 ppm NO, 2,000 ppm CO, 10% H 2O. Air/steam treatment at 800 ⁰C was with 10% O 2/10% H 2O/ N 2. Another curve was also obtained with the air/steam treated sample which was then exposed to reducing treatment with CO at 375 ⁰C as it was previously shown to improve CO oxidation reactivity of Pt/ceria catalysts. CO oxidation activity was the best for reactive treated sample. NO oxidation activity was the best for reactive treated sample. Supplementary .

Ce L 3 XANES data and estimated fractions of Ce in different oxidation states in CeAl08 .

NOTE: The as received CA08 is very similar to CeO 2 standard, i.e., Ce4+ (Physica Scripta 2005, T115, 802–806; ChemPhysChem 2016, 17, 3494 – 3503). Reduction of CA08 in H2 at 400 °C or CeAl (reactive HTA at 900°C and then exposed to air ) is a mixture of Ce4+ and Ce3+ at about the same amount. The CA08 (reactive HTA 900 °C) and then in situ treated in H 2 at 400 °C has much more Ce3+ with a smaller amount of Ce4+. The fraction of Ce3+ and Ce4+ was determined by two different methods (described below). Note: CeO 2 has a very small pre -edge peak (5.719 keV) and 3 peaks at 5.7241, 5.7280 and 5.7352 keV (ChemPhysChem 2016, 17, 3494 – 3503); Ce3+ has a single peak at lower energy. Also, as an L 3 edge, the XANES shape and energy is dependent on the exact number of bonds and bond distance to the absorbing atom. Thus, determination of a Ce3+ XANES from this oxide is necessary to get a more precise XANES fit for the composition. Previously, many papers use Ce(NO 3)3 x H 2O for Ce3+ XANES fitting; however, these oxides likely have a different CN and R, thus, a better choice is a Ce3+ from the phase that is present. L3 Ce XANES from 5.68 -5.75 keV for Ce 4+ and Ce3+ CeA08 Oxides CeAl08 CeO 2 (Ce4+ as received) CeAl08 Ce 2O3 NOTE: The Ce3+ CA08 oxide was obtained by: 1) The fraction of Ce4+ (0.34) in the reactively 900 °C CeAl08 aged sample reduced in H 2 400 C was determined by the ratio of the height of the peak in both 52 samples at 5.7352 keV where there is no peak in Ce3+ samples; 2) The XANES of the Ce4+ CeAl08 (as received) sample, was multiplied by 0.34 and subtracted from the C eAl08 aged sample reduced in H 2 400 C sample; and 3) The difference XANES spectrum, i.e., Ce3+ CeAl08 oxide, which represents 66% of the Ce in the sample, was normalized by dividing by 0.66. Note: CeO 2 has a very small pre -edge peak (5.719 keV) and 3 peaks at 5.7241, 5.7280 and 5.7352 keV (ChemPhysChem 2016, 17, 3494 – 3503); Ce3+ is a single peak at lower energy. 1. CA08 as is XANES energy shape, EXAFS and higher shells are identical to the CeO 2 Standard a. CeO 2 has a very small pre -edge peak (5.719 keV) and 3 peaks at 5.7241, 5.7280 and 5.7352 keV ( Physica Scripta 2005, T115, 802 –806; ChemPhysChem 2016, 17, 3494 – 3503) b. CeAl08 has the same 4 peaks as CeO 2 at the same energies; this is used at the Ce4+ XANES reference. c. Method 1: Ce3+ compounds do not have a XANES peak at 5.7352 keV (see reference literature compounds). The fraction of Ce4+ was determined from the height of this peak (above the normalized edge step) compared to that for CeO 2 (CeAl08). d. Method 2: A Ce3+ reference for this oxide was determine by determining the fraction of Ce4+ for sample C eAl08 aged reduced at 400 °C in H 2. The ratio of the heights (method 1) gave 34% Ce4+. The XANES of C eAl08 was multiplied by 0.34 and subtracted from CA08 aged reduced at 400 °C in H 2. The difference file gave no peak at 5.7352 keV indicating all the Ce4+ had been removed from the spectrum. The resulting XANES was due to 66% of the Ce in the sample. This Ce3+ XANES was normalized by dividing the spectrum by 0.66 and used as a C e3+ CeAl08 oxide to fit the other mixed valent state CA08 oxides. e. The fraction of Ce3+ in the other samples was determined by a linear combination of the Ce3+ and Ce4+ CA08 oxides. There is a n agreement between these two methods in estimating the relative fractions of Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ (the only two oxidation states of ceria in our samples) for various C eAl08 samples. 53 Supplementary Table 5.
