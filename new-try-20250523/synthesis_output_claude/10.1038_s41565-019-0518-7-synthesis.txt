(c) The corresponding EANES profile of Pt HT -SAs synthesized at 2000 K, showi ng a structure different than Pt foil (Pt -Pt). As the synthesis temperature is much higher than the carbonization temperature of CA -CNF, to avoid cluster formation we used a less loading of 0.005 µ mol/cm2 (half of the loading when synthesizing at 1500 K). 8 Supplementary Fig. S 10.

(a) Bonding energy for Pt -C and Pt-N bonds. (b) The corresponding charge transfer diagram for the se bonds. (Unit in the legend: e/bohr3) In general, Pt -C bonds are stronger than Pt - N bonds in the similar bond structure; in addition, the bond nature of Pt -C is more covalent while Pt-N is more ionic from the charge density diagram. Supplementary Fig. S12. Simulated Pt dispersion process and Pt -C bonds formation. The deviation of a single Pt atom from a 30 -Pt cluster and forming different type of Pt -C bonds : (a) type 8 Pt -C bond and (b) type 9 Pt -C bond (bond types in b ). Ea is the activation ener gy, ΔG is the energy released when a Pt -C bond forms. The energy analysis shows the Pt -C bond formation from a Pt cluster is a thermodynamically favorable process but kinetically requiring an activation energy which can only be achieved by a high temperatu re synthesis. 10 Supplementary Fig. S 13. Simulated shockwave dispersion at (a) 500 K, (b) 1000 K, (c) 2000 K, and (d) 2500 K and the corresponding dispersion diagram at different stages: I, initial condition; II, 5th cycle heating; III, after 50 cycles heating; IV, subsequent annealing. Low temperature (500 and 1000 K) shockwaves fail to fully disperse Pt cluster within the giv en period while high temperature (2000 and 2500 K ) shockwaves show a higher dispersion efficiency than that of 1500 K (shown in main text e). 11 Supplemen tary Fig. S1 4. Shockwave synthesis of (a) Ru and (b) Co HT -SAs on CA -CNFs. Note that the single atom density for Co is much lower than Pt and Ru, which arises fro m the high vapor pressure of Co making it more volatile at high temperatures.

(a) Direct, r adiative and conductive shockwave synthesis of Pt HT -SAs on reduced graphene oxide (RGO), C3N4, and TiO 2, revealing the method’s universality on different s ubstrates (~0.5 wt%) . (b)-(d) The corresponding HAADF images. Pt HT -SAs on RGO was directly Joule heated. Pt HT -SAs on the C3N4 sample s were made by radiative shockwave synthesis. Pt HT -SAs on the TiO 2 sample was synthesized by first depositing a thin layer (2.5 nm) of TiO 2 on the nanofibers in CA-CNFs via atomic layer deposition and then applying the shockwave method to the precursor loaded CA -CNF -TiO 2 substrate for single atom dispersion. 12 To understand the single atom dispersion on C 3N4 and TiO 2, we performed DFT calculation s to investigate the competition between the atomization a nd sintering of Pt on the two substrates. We construct ed two simulation models: a Pt 6 cluster on C 3N4 and another Pt 6 cluster on TiO 2 (both denoted as the zero energy state s). The model sizes are 14.76 Å × 14.76Å and 11.84 Å× 12.99 Å, respectively, corresponding to the 2× 2 primitive cells of C 3N4 and TiO 2, which are large enough to eliminate the interaction between periodical images. We found that the dispersion of Pt 6 cluster into Pt 5+ Pt 1 (a single atom formation) on perfect C3N4 and TiO 2 leads t o a slight increase of energy in both systems (+0.53 eV and +2.14 eV, respectively), indicating an unfavorable process. We then calculated the dispersion of the Pt cluster on the defective C 3N4 and TiO 2, and found the evolution of a single Pt atom escaping from a Pt 6 cluster and eventually being stabilized at a defective site. The dispersion process is thermodynamically favorable (ΔG<0, -0.41 eV and -1.43 eV, respectively) however, an energy barrier exists before bonding to the defective site. Therefore, th e DFT study explains the formation of Pt single atoms on C 3N4 and TiO 2, where high temperature again provides the activation energy to overcome the energy barrier for stable bonds formation with the defect sites, supporting our proposed mechanism. Notabl y, except the original defects in C 3N4 and TiO 2, more defects are introduced into the system via the high temperature synthesis. At high temperature, C 3N4 will be slightly carbonized by losing N atoms and leaving multiple C and N dangling bonds for single atom dispersion. For the TiO 2 substrate, after high temperature shockwave synthesis, the original TiO 2 layer structure becomes a randomly -assembled nanoparticle structure, leading to a large amount of defects exposed at the surface and edge s for atom stabilization . Therefore, the high temperature shockwave synthesis not only provides sufficient activation energy for stabilizing single atoms at defect sites, but also can improve the dispersion density by creating or introducing more defect sit es due to high temperature synthesis.

The structural evolution of C 3N4 for shockwave heating (1s*10 ) and continuous heating (10s): (a) pictures and (b) XRD. While impurity carbon peaks emerge at a longer duration (10s), t he stru cture is well maintained after the shockwave heating (1s*10) , demonstrating its advantages for temperature -sensitive materials by limiting the heating duration. The rapid radiative heating eliminates the use of electrodes in Joule heating and can enable a continuous production with improved scalability. This process can be further accelerated by enabling automatic and streamline d production, where all the loading, heating, and collection processes can be integrated into a production line (F ig. S18). It should be noted that as different substrates have different thermal conductivit ies, the realization of complete single atom dispersion may require different radiative heating parameters (temperature, duration, shock cycles) for different kinds of substrates. Also, other high temperature heating strategies, including laser, microwave, and aerosol spray can be applied to accommodate different materials and processing for high temperature synthesis and stabilization of single atoms.
