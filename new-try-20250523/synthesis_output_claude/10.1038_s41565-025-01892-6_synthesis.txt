Methods Synthesis of CuZSM SA, CuZSM SACL and CuZSM CLNP HZSM-5 and NaZSM-5 zeolites with SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios of 25, 38, 50 and 85 were obtained from Nankai University Catalyst Company and Zeolyst International. CuZSM SA was prepared by an ion exchange method 37 . Typically, 1 g of ZSM-5 was dispersed in 50 ml of ethanol by magnetic stirring. Subsequently, 10 mg of CuSO 4 ·5H 2 O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) was ultrasonically dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water, and this solution was added into the ZSM-5 suspension. After vigorous stirring for 12 h, CuZSM SA was successfully obtained. The obtained products were thoroughly washed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by centrifugation. Subsequently, they were dried in an oven at 60 °C to remove any residual solvents, resulting in the final CuZSM SA product. The dried product was meticulously ground into a fine powder for further use. Subsequently, the porcelain boat-containing CuZSM SA was gradually heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min − 1 in a 5% H 2 /Ar atmosphere. The sample was maintained at this temperature for 6 h to ensure complete reduction. Upon natural cooling to room temperature, CuZSM SACL was successfully obtained. During the typical synthesis process of CuZSM CLNP, 1 g of ZSM-5 and 1 mg of CuSO 4 ·5H 2 O were first mixed thoroughly grinding. Subsequently, the mixture was heated to 550 °C at a controlled heating rate of 5 °C min − 1 in a 5% H 2 /Ar atmosphere. It was maintained at this temperature for 6 h to ensure complete reduction. The sample was naturally cooled to room temperature, resulting in the formation of CuZSM CLNP. The product was washed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by centrifugation, and then dried overnight at 60 °C. Synthesis of Cu NPs-5 nm, Cu NPs-20 nm and Cu NPs-100 nm In a typical preparation of Cu NPs-5 nm, 13.3 mg Cu(acac) 2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 27 mg ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 ml oleylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 ml oleic acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) were mixed and ultrasonicated for approximately 0.5 h in a sealed vial (30 ml). Then, the vial was transferred into an oil bath and heated at 180 °C for 3 h ( ). The resulting colloidal products in the vial were collected by centrifugation and then washed with an ethanol/cyclohexane mixture to obtain Cu NPs-5 nm. The preparations of Cu NPs-20 nm and Cu NPs-100 nm were similar to that of Cu NPs-5 nm but without adding oleic acid and ascorbic acid, respectively.
