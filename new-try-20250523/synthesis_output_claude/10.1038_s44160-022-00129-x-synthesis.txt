The discussion about the effect of the relative contents of the different nitrogen species on CO 2RR performance. We presented the nitrogen species ratios of three Ni-SACs in Supplementary 6b. There is a slight difference in the ratios of pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N , and oxidized-N among three Ni -SACs. But the sum of pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N are nearly the same, and these three types of N are generally considered as coordinated N for central active metal atoms. The N and Ni contents are ~13 at.% and 1.5 at.% in Ni -SACs, which means more than half of N atoms do not serve as coordination ato ms for Ni single atoms. And it is nearly impossible to figure out which N species serve as coordination atoms. However, a s we know, the performance at low current density can reflect the intrinsic performance of active sites. Thus we compared CO 2RR performance at the region of low current density. The I-V curves and CO FEs of three Ni -SACs are nearly the same at potentials range from -0.43 to -0.63 V with current densities from 2 to 20 mA cm-2 (Figs. 5b,c), which means that three Ni -SACs shows ver y close activity and selectivity. Thus the slight difference of nitrogen species ratios can not affect the CO 2RR performance. Besi des, the TOF values of three Ni -SACs are highly close from -0.43 to -0.63 V (Figs. 5e), further demonstrating the above viewpo int. Thus we believe that the small variations in nitrogen species distribution have a negligible effect on the CO 2RR performance. 97 Supplementary Note 2. The discussion of successful synthesis of different combinations of multi-M-SACs. XPS results confirmed that the corresponding metal species existed in each multi -M-SACs (Supplementary Figs. 52-57). No metal nanoparticle diffractions were observed in XRD patterns (Supplementary ), which was further confirmed by STEM images where all the multi -M-SACs showed atomically and uniformly dispersed metal atoms (Supplementary Figs. 59-71), and EXAFS spectra where different M -N coordinations were revealed ( Supplementary Figs. 72, 73). 98 Supplementary Note 3. Optimization of CO2RR performance of 3D -Ni-SAC by regulation of mesopore sizes and creation of micropores. We further investigate the impacts of the size of mesopores as well as the presence of micropores on CO 2RR performance . We first used SiO2 nanoparticles templates with smaller sizes, and prepared another 3D -Ni-SAC with different pore size. We investigated the BET surface area and pore volume of this sample by N2 sorption. The BET surface area and pore volume of this 3D-Ni-SAC is 282.4 m2 g-1 and 1.10 cm3 g-1, and its mesopore size distribution was centered at 9.1 nm ( Supplementary ). Thus we named it 3D-Ni- SAC-9.1nm. Compared with previously synthesized 3D -Ni-SAC with mesopore size of 12.9 nm ( 3D-Ni-SAC-12.9nm), the 3D-Ni-SAC-9.1nm showed smaller mesopore size and larger pore volume. As a result, its CO 2RR performance compared to 3D -Ni-SAC-12.9nm showed a slightly improved activity and similar CO FEs (Supplementary ). The results clearly suggested that, while smaller pore size could further improve the catalytic activity, but the improvements will be incremental compared to the huge increase from the 2D mesopore structure to 3D as demonstrated. More i mportantly, we al so prepared 3D -Ni- SAC with micropores (3D -Ni-SAC-MP) by an ammonia gas activation method. These micropores could further facilitate the CO 2 diffusion from mesopore channels to the internal single atomic sites for better mass transports and thus catalytic a ctivity. As shown in N2 adsorption -desorption isotherms ( Supplementary a ), the 3D-Ni-SAC-MP showed a very strong adsorption -desorption at low P/P 0 region, which means many micropores have been created onto 3D -Ni-SAC-MP. The presence of micropores in 3D- Ni-SAC-MP was also confirmed by pore size distribution curves ( Supplementary Fig s. 86b, c). Meanwhile, the mesopores of original 3D-Ni-SAC was kept well in 3D-Ni-SAC- MP (Supplementary b). The BET surface area and pore volume of this 3D-Ni- SAC-MP is 722.6 m2 g-1 and 1.66 cm3 g-1, which enhanced a lot compared with 3D -Ni- SAC. As a result, its CO 2RR test compared with 3D -Ni-SAC exhibited a much improved activity, as well as better CO FEs especially under large current densities (350 to 450 mA cm-2, Supplementary ). These results clearly demonstrate that the presence of micropores on top of the mesopore structure in SACs can further improve mass transports for significantly enhanced catalytic performance. 99 Supplementary references 1.
