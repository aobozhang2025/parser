Methods Synthesis of PtNi alloy nanowires All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. In a typical synthesis, 20 mg Pt(acac) 2 and 40 mg Ni(acac) 2 were mixed with 130 mg glucose, 1.7 mg W(CO) 6 and 60 mg PVP-40 in a glass vial, with 5 ml of oleylamine and octadecene (3:2 volume ratio) as co-solvent. The mixture was heated to 140 °C for 6 h to form Pt–NiO core–shell nanowires. The resulting nanowires were collected via centrifuge at 7,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. After loading the nanowires on carbon black, the catalysts were then annealed under 450 °C in argon/hydrogen (97:3) atmosphere for 12 h to obtain the PtNi alloy nanowires supported on carbon black.
