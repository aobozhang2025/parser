Photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the as -prepared carbon suspension excited by light with various wavelengths, which shows an excitation -dependent PL, confirming the successful preparation of GQDs. 4 Supplementary . TEM images of as-prepared GQDs -NH 2, showing high crystallinity and uniform lateral size of ca. 6 ~ 8 nm. We should optimize the size of GQDs to achieve the single atom catalyst with maximal metal loading. We employed a small organic molecular fusion method to prepare th e GQDs. The size of the GQDs can be controlled by the hydrothermal temperature and time. A dialysis process was employed to exclude the unfused impurities and further control the size of the GQDs. We found that if the synthesized GQDs is too small ( e.g. sub-nanometer), the as -prepared solution cannot be purified. This is due to that dialysis tube with low cutoff molecular should be used to prevent product loss for sub -nanometer sample. At the same time, the impurities were also kept in the products, which w ill make GQDs self -assembly step unsuccessful. Otherwise, GQDs with larger size will decrease the anchor sites for isolated TM atom. Based on the above facts, we found that the optimized size of the GQDs is around 5 ~10 nm for our study. 5 Supplementary . XRD pattern of as -prepared GQDs -NH 2, showing a prominent peak at ca. 26.6° . It demonstrates that the graphene quantum dots are well -crystallized while they are highly functionalized. 6 Supplementary . Aberration -corrected HAADF -STEM images of Ir -O-C-7 catalyst. Nitrogen -doped carbon was typically used as the support to anchor the isolated metal atoms due to the strong metal -nitrogen bonding, which could stabilize the highly active single metal atoms for atomic distribution. However, the relatively weak metal -oxygen coordination could not prevent the aggregation of the metal atoms especially under high -loading metal conditions. We tried to prepare the high -loading iridium SA catalyst on oxygen doped carbon by replacing the GQDs -NH 2 with GQDs -OH (hydroxide functionalized GQDs). However, we found that Ir nanoclusters were formed under the same synthetic conditions, as shown above . This is due to the weak interaction between the Ir and the oxygen coordination sites. Thus, it is not possible to simply replace the amine group with other groups like -OH while still achieving such a high loading single atom. 7 Supplementary . (A) XPS survey spectrum of as -obtained GQDs -NH 2 which gives a nitrogen, oxygen and carbon content of 10.79 at.%, 20.03 at.% and 69.18 at.%, respectively . (B) The deconvolution of high - resolution nitrogen 1 s spectrum, displaying dominated contribution from C -NH 2 with trace amount of residual NO 2. 8 Supplementary . SEM images of freeze -dried Ir3+/GQDs -NH 2 assembly. It reveals that the ca. 6 ~ 8 nm well - dispersed graphene quantum dots will cross -link with each other and then self -assemble into layered bulk carbon during the freeze -drying process, which is consistent with reported literature (1, 2). 9 Supplementary . SEM images of as -prepared Ir-N-C-7 catalyst under 500 ° C in Argon atmosphere. 10 Supplementary . (A) XPS survey spectra of Ir -N-C catalyst with different iridium loading. They showed main contribution from carbon, nitrogen, iridium elements, together with very low oxygen content ( ca. 2 wt.%). No chlorine element could be detected after pyro lysis in Argon, suggesting the complete removal of the Cl ligand. (B) High -resolution chlorine 2 p spectra, confirming that there was no detectable chlorine signal in the as -synthesized Ir -N-C catalyst system . 11 Supplementary . Simultaneous EELS and EDS point spectra of a single metal site for Ir -N-C-7 sample, which reveals the contribution from iridium, nitrogen and carbon. This analysis strongly suggests the formation of iridium -nitrogen -carbon moiety in as -prepared Ir -N-C cata lysts. The Cu peak in the EDS spectrum is background signal from the support grid. 12 Supplementary . The EDS elements mapping of Ir-N-C-7 sample, showing the uniform distribution of carbon, nitrogen and iridium elements over the whole sample. Scar bar: 100 nm. 13 Supplementary . The representative STEM images of Ir-N-C-7 sample with high iridium loading, showing that no iridium particles or clusters could be observed. 14 Supplementary . The representative STEM images of ultra-high loading single atom iridium catalyst , where we observed some very bright zone on the bulk carbon layer. The stepwise observation in higher magnification reveals that they are only dense isolated iridium atom area. No iridium lattice could be observed. 15 Supplementary . STEM images of Ir -N-C-8 catalyst. While densely populated single iridium atoms could be observed, iridium nanoparticles were also found in this sample. 16 Supplementary . (A) The TGA curve of the Ir -N-C-7 catalyst in air. It shows a 3.9% weight los s from room temperature to ca. 180 °C, which could be ascribed to the evaporation of absorbed water. Then, an obvious weight loss (> 50%) is observed at 300 ~400 °C, which is due to the burning off of the carbon matrix in air. Finally , the iridium content was oxidized into iridium oxide, which was confirmed by the ( B) XRD measurement. 17 Supplementary . The normalized Ir L 3-edge XANES spectra for Ir -N-C-7 sample. The data for commercial iridium foil and IrO 2 powder were included for comparison. 18 Supplementary Fig . 16. EXAFS fitting results for Ir -N-C-7 sample with ~40 wt.% Ir loading. The inset shows the fitted model for Ir -N-C-7 catalyst. Based on our XPS estimation, the nitrogen content is around 27.8 at.% in Ir-N-C-7 catalyst (Table 1), in which the Ir loading 3.84 at.% (>40 wt.%). Our Ir -N-C catalyst shows an Ir -Nx-C coordination from the simultaneous acquisition of electron energy loss (EELS) and energy -dispersive X -ray spectra (EDS) with the beam po sitioned on a bright atom . Further EXFAS fitting suggested a possible Ir -N4 configuration for the Ir sites. Since the N/Ir atomic ratio is higher than 4, we believed that our catalyst system offers enough nitrogen sites for high loading single atoms to be embedded. 19 Supplementary .

The TEM study reveals that while the GQDs will fuse into larger bulk carbon, they still maintain their nanosized geometry. Scale bars: D, 10 nm; E, 10 nm; F, 5 nm. 21 Supplementary Fig . 19. (A) XRD and ( B) XPS tests of the GO and amine functionalized GO (GO -NH 2). The XPS test reveals a ~20 at.% nitrogen dopant in the GO -NH 2 sample. ( C) XRD patterns of the as -prepared Ir/Carbon catalyst with different Ir loading. 22 Supplementary .

( B) The deconvolution of platinum 4 f spectra for Pt -N- C-6 catalyst. The Pt 4 f7/2 peak located at 72.5 eV , which is much higher than that for metallic Pt (4f7/2 at 71.1 eV). The oxidized platinum species in Pt -N-C-6 implies the formation of platinum - nitrogen coordination. The Pt 4 f7/2 - 4f5/2 splitting is 3.3 eV in our case, matching well with literature . 23 Supplementary . The EDS elements mapping of Pt-N-C-6 sample, showing the uniform distribution of carbon, nitrogen and platinum elements over the whole sample. Scar bar: 50 nm. 24 Supplementary . Simultaneous EELS and EDS element spectra of a single metal site for Pt -N-C-6 sample, which reveals the contribution from platinum, nitrogen and carbon. This analysis suggests the formation of platinum -nitrogen -carbon moiety in as -prepared Pt -N-C catalysts. The Cu peak in th e EDS spectrum is background signal from the support grid. 25 Supplementary . (A) The TGA curve of the Ni -N-C catalyst in air. ( B) The XRD pattern of the final product of Ni - N-C catalyst after TGA test. It reveals the conversion of Ni -N-C to NiO during TGA test in air. 26 Supplementary . Ni 2p XPS spectra of Ni -N-C catalyst with ~15 wt.% Ni . The nickel foil data was included for comparison. The XPS results show that the nickel peak in Ni -N-C located between the Ni0 and Ni2+, revealing the oxidized valence state of the nickel species in the Ni -N-C sample. 27 Supplementary . The PDF spectra for ca. 15 wt.% Ni -N-C sample over large r range. 28 Supplementary . (A) The steady -state current densities and ( B) the corresponding FEs of CO of Ni -N-C-1.5 and Ni - N-C-3 catalyst in a flow cell system. 1.0 M KHCO 3 was used as the electrolyte. ( C) The CO partial current densities of Ni -N-C-1.5 and Ni -N-C-3 catalyst at different applied potentials. In order to precisely evaluate the intrinsic CO 2RR performance of Ni -N-C SA catalysts in different batches of tests, the CO 2RR electrolysis was conducted in a standard three -electrode flow -cell instead of the two -electrode fuel cell. It shows that the high -loading Ni -N-C-3 catalyst shows much enhanced CO 2RR activity compared with its Ni -N-C-1.5 counterparts, while they show similar CO selectivity. The error bars represent two independent samples. 29 Supplementary . Aberration -corrected HAADF -STEM images of Ni -N-C-3 catalyst after 1 -hour electrolysis. 30 Supplementary Table 1.
