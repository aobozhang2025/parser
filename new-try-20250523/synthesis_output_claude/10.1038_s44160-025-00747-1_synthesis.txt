synthesis of C 1 products: the direct dissociation pathway, the RWGS + CO-Hydro pathway and the formate pathway. Two typical reaction pathways are shown for the synthesis of C 2+ products: the CO 2 -modified Fischer–Tropsch pathway and the methanol-mediated pathway. SMSI, strong metal–support interaction; RWGS, reverse water–gas shift; CO-Hydro, CO hydrogenation, also named Fischer–Tropsch synthesis; OX-ZEO, metal oxides and zeolites.

Full size image The reaction pathways for C 1 products (CO, CH 4 , CH 3 OH and HCOOH) are well established compared to those for C 2+ products ( ). Generally, there are two main reaction intermediates, carbon monoxide (*CO) and formate (*HCOO). *CO can be produced from the reverse water–gas shift (RWGS, CO 2 hydrogenation to CO and H 2 O) process or CO 2 dissociation via direct C–O bond cleavage. The resulting *CO is hydrogenated to form the final products. Thus, the three reaction pathways for C 1 products are the RWGS + CO-Hydro (CO hydrogenation, also named Fischer–Tropsch synthesis) pathway, the direct C–O bond cleavage pathway and the formate pathway. If *CO or *HCOOH adsorption is weak, further hydrogenation could be inhibited, and these products can desorb from the catalyst surface to produce CO or HCOOH. Methane and methanol synthesis are proposed to involve at least four or three reaction pathways, respectively. The key determinant for the formation of CH 4 or methanol is dissociation of the second C–O bond, as the formation of CH 4 requires this dissociation. Therefore, efficient activation of the C–O bond at low reaction temperatures is essential when designing catalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation. For C 2+ products (such as light olefins, dimethyl ether, ethanol and gasoline), the typical reaction pathways are the methanol-mediated route with a hydrocarbon-pool mechanism or the CO 2 -modified Fischer–Tropsch route over bifunctional catalysts. Bifunctional catalysts contain Zn/In/Cu-based metal oxides or Fe-based metal oxides and zeolites (OX-ZEO). The metal oxides catalyse reactants to form methanol or *CO intermediates, which then further react to form C 2+ products via oligomerization, isomerization and aromatization steps over the zeolites. Therefore, although OX-ZEO catalysts can catalyse either route, different zeolites (HZSM-5 and SAPO-34) present different reaction pathways for the synthesis of different C 2+ products. For instance, ZnZrO/SAPO-34 generates 80.0% light olefins and ZnZrO/HZSM-5 generates 80.3% C 5+ products by CO 2 hydrogenation with the same methanol-mediated route ( , bottom), but with a different hydrocarbon-pool mechanism over the zeolites 9 , 10 . The Na-Fe 3 O 4 /HZSM-5 catalyst achieves 79.4% C 5+ products, but via the CO 2 -modified Fischer–Tropsch route ( , top) 11 . To control C 2+ -product selectivity, C–O activation and C–C coupling need to be regulated. Furthermore, *(CH 2 ) n and *CH x O intermediate adsorption and desorption over bifunctional catalysts are affected by the metal-oxide species, the porous structure and Brønsted acids of the zeolites, as well as proximity effects, demonstrating the effects of different combinations of multifunctional active sites on product distributions. Design principles for catalysts to vary selectivity The results of CO 2 hydrogenation performance testing (including CO 2 conversion, product selectivity and the main reaction conditions) for some representative studies on the design of catalysts to improve selectivity are summarized in Table 1 . These results indicate that CO 2 hydrogenation product selectivity is affected by a range of parameters, which are analysed with examples in the following. Specific principles for the tuning of product selectivity are proposed, including via chemical states, particle sizes, crystal facets, synergistic effects and unique structures for catalyst design. Table 1 Summary of product selectivity for CO 2 hydrogenation based on different catalyst design principles. Full size table Chemical states Transition metals are often the main active components of CO 2 hydrogenation catalysts, so product selectivity can be regulated by the design of the metal sites. Both the geometric and electronic structures of metals determine product distributions. Accordingly, we will first look at the effect of chemical states on tuning reaction selectivity. This is an inherent catalytic property of metals that is independent of external operating conditions. For example, Ni and Ru have high activity for CO 2 methanation (CO 2 hydrogenation to CH 4 ), whereas Cu and In tend to hydrogenate CO 2 to CO or methanol. Fe is usually used for the synthesis of light olefins and liquid fuels. However, product selectivity also varies greatly over the same metal-based catalysts when the geometric properties of the metals are adjusted. With transition-metal catalysts, before the CO 2 hydrogenation reaction, in situ reduction under a H 2 atmosphere is used to ‘activate’ the catalysts. As the chemical state of the active sites affects product selectivity, one area of focus is catalyst pretreatment methods. The formal valence states of the metals greatly affect selectivity (a ) 12 . The adsorption strength of CO on the metal centre is key, as the metal d orbitals donate electrons to the π * orbital of CO, which affects CO adsorption. Aitbekova and colleagues used oxygen to treat metallic Ru nanoparticles (NPs) supported on CeO 2 to generate a single-site RuO x /CeO 2 -ox catalyst, and the reaction pathways over the catalyst were altered, resulting in a switch in the reaction selectivity from CH 4 to CO (b and Table 1 ) 13 . This difference in selectivity is a consequence of the oxygen redispersing the initial Ru NPs into atomically dispersed RuO x species with weaker CO adsorption ability, which favours CO desorption. Metallic and oxidized Co components supported on Al 2 O 3 or TiO 2 can produce different products, with the oxidized CoO/TiO 2 -ox producing more CH 4 (~60%) and the metallic Co/TiO 2 -red producing more CO. The partial encapsulation of metallic Co by TiO 2− x via strong metal–support interactions (SMSIs, an interaction that is usually observed between metal NPs and reducible supports) 14 weakens the hydrogenation ability of Co/TiO 2 -red to produce more CO 12 . Oxidized CoO/TiO 2 -ox has also been reported to be more favourable for C 2+ synthesis (11%) via the hydrogen-assisted CO 2 activation pathway, whereas the metallic Co/TiO 2 -red favours the direct dissociation pathway (b ) 15 . : Chemical states of metals involved in regulating CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity. a , Gas (O 2 or H 2 )-treated Ru/CeO 2 or Co/TiO 2 catalysts to redisperse metal particles with different valence states (ox, oxidized; red, reduced), resulting in different selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. b , Catalytic performance of Ru/CeO 2 or Co/TiO 2 catalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation with different product selectivity.

Full size image Studies on the chemical states of Cu/Ni/Zn/Fe/Ce species have been reported 16 . Different metal species with similar particle sizes can influence the adsorption and conversion behaviours of both reactants and intermediates, and thus product selectivity. For instance, Cu exists as Cu 0 , Cu + and Cu 2+ species. There is an interplay between Cu + and Cu 0 . Cu + species are more active for CO 2 adsorption and activation to methanol by stabilization of the *CO intermediates, whereas Cu 0 species are the active sites for H 2 activation 17 . A Ni-doped CeO 2 catalyst with ionic Ni and Ce 3+ instead of metallic Ni as the active site has been reported for high-performance CO 2 methanation 18 . Fe species (such as Fe, Fe 3 O 4 , θ -Fe 3 C and Fe 5 C 2 ) with tunable selectivity have been studied systematically, and Fe 3 O 4 was found to be fully selective for CO synthesis, and θ -Fe 3 C selective for hydrocarbon products (>97%; c and Table 1 ) 19 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the adsorption of *CO intermediates and H 2 dissociation over Fe 3 C species are much stronger than over Fe 3 O 4 , improving the selectivity of the hydrocarbon products. The dynamic behaviour of Fe species revealed during CO 2 hydrogenation offers new insights into the origin of the catalytic activity. Zhu and colleagues reported the correlation between the dynamic structural evolution of Fe species and CO 2 hydrogenation performance, indicating that the formed Fe 5 C 2 -rich surface is favourable for C 2+ selectivity (d and Table 1 ) 20 . Strategies need to be developed for maintaining the active species under reaction atmospheres. Additionally, iron carbides rather than iron nitrides have been shown to be the active sites for the selective synthesis of C 2+ hydrocarbons 21 . For example, when Fe 5 C 2 was introduced to ZnFe 2 O 4 , the product selectivity switched from methanol (99.4%) to C 2+ OH alcohols (98.2% and Table 1 ) 22 . Also, the proximity of ZnFe 2 O 4 and Fe–Zn–Na affects the selectivity of higher alcohols, with the powder-mixing method achieving the highest selectivity for C 2+ OH (Table 1 ). Therefore, understanding the origin of the activity and selectivity as well as the catalyst reconstruction is a key research topic in this field. Particle size Regulating metal particle sizes is an effective strategy to control selectivity. Structure sensitivity is well known in heterogeneous catalysis, and the hydrogenation abilities of single atoms, clusters, small NPs and large NPs differ. Metal particle size can affect CO 2 dissociation as well as the adsorption energies of the reaction intermediates, and methanol synthesis is sensitive to cluster size 23 . Atomically dispersed Zn can improve the selectivity of methanol by suppressing formate decomposition over a Cu–Zn catalyst for CO 2 hydrogenation 24 . Larger Cu NPs are not active for CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol, but single-atom Cu 1 –O 3 units have 100% selectivity towards methanol, and small Cu clusters generate CO (a,b ) 25 . Zhang and colleagues used DFT to examine the effect of Cu NP size on CO 2 hydrogenation activity, finding that intermediate-sized Cu 19 clusters have the optimal CO 2 hydrogenation activity due to a moderate CO 2 coverage and a low CO 2 dissociation barrier. For C 1 products, small clusters and Ni/Ru/Re atomic species are selective for CO, but larger particle sizes of Ni/Ru/Re NPs are selective for CH 4 (refs. 13 , 26 , 27 , 28 ). Compared to smaller Ni NPs, larger Ni NPs with more metallic states facilitate the rate-determining step of H 2 -assisted CO dissociation and therefore enhance CO 2 conversion and CH 4 selectivity 27 . Interestingly, when Ni loading and Ni NP size are precisely controlled 29 , different activity and selectivity over Ni/β-Ga 2 O 3 is observed, with the smaller Ni NPs exhibiting higher activity for the RWGS reaction and the larger Ni NPs favouring hydrogen dissociation for methanol synthesis. A similar metal particle size effect is observed during the synthesis of C 2+ products. Smaller Fe NPs are sensitive to CO production, whereas CH 4 and C 2+ products are more likely to be generated over larger Fe NPs (c,d and Table 1 ) 26 . The main reason for this difference is that larger metal particles with more terrace sites are not only favourable for the formation of *HCOO species, but also exhibit higher chain-growth probability. : Particle size effect of metals on CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity. a , Effect of Cu particle size on CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol over the Cu/ZrO 2 catalyst 25 .

Full size image The correlation between metal particle sizes and CO 2 hydrogenation is still not well established, but it suggests that catalytic performance is sensitive to catalyst structure and should therefore be investigated further. Additionally, the size of the catalyst support should also be studied due to the influence of metal–support interactions (MSIs). For example, CeO 2 supports calcined at different temperatures (450 and 1,000 °C) with different particle sizes (15.2 and 191.7 nm) have different MSIs and CO/H adsorption ability, resulting in different selectivity for CO compared with supported Co NPs 30 . The CO selectivity is tuned from 24% over Co/CeO 2 -450 to 49% over Co/CeO 2 -1000 (Table 1 ). C–O activation and C–C coupling processes should be considered from the perspective of the correlation between particle sizes and C 2+ products when designing highly selective catalysts. Crystal facets Product selectivity is also affected by the exposed crystal facets and the crystal phase of the support. The crystal phase can also be transformed during CO 2 hydrogenation, resulting in different reaction rates and product selectivity 31 . The crystal planes of Co 3 O 4 have been shown to influence CO 2 hydrogenation products. Rhombic dodecahedral Co 3 O 4 with {111} and {001} phases shows high selectivity for CH 4 , whereas nanorod Co 3 O 4 with {110} and {001} phases is more selective for CO ( ). This is because Co 3 O 4 {111} can produce more oxygen vacancies that promote the CH 3 O* intermediate dissociation and further hydrogenation. The crystal phases of the support are also important for tuning product selectivity. As shown in , TiO 2 with two different crystal phases used to support Ru or Co catalysts displays distinct CO 2 hydrogenation performances (a,b ). When Ru or Co catalysts are supported on rutile ( r ) TiO 2 they are selective for CH 4 , as shown with 1Ru/ r -TiO 2 and Co/ r -TiO 2 . However, the main product is CO when the reaction is performed over 1Ru/ a -TiO 2 and Co/ a -TiO 2 catalysts ( a , anatase; c and Table 1 ) 33 , 34 . An operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) study indicated that differences in electron transfer from Ru to TiO 2 induced by hydrogen spillover (the surface migration of activated hydrogen atoms from metal active sites onto the catalyst support) influence the adsorption and hydrogenation of the *CO intermediate 35 , resulting in different selectivities. The operando DRIFTS results indicate that Co/TiO 2 catalysts with varying support crystal phases catalyse different reaction pathways; Co/ r -TiO 2 follows the formate pathway and Co/ a -TiO 2 the CO pathway. Accordingly, the product selectivity can be manipulated 34 . In 2 O 3 supported on monoclinic ZrO 2 ( m -ZrO 2 ) is more selective for methanol, whereas In 2 O 3 / t -ZrO 2 ( t , tetragonal) shows relatively high selectivity for CO production (c,d ) 36 . This is because m -ZrO 2 can transfer more electrons to the In–O–In units of In 2 O 3 , enriching the electron density of In 2 O 3 , so the *HCOO intermediates are more easily hydrogenated to methanol. : Crystal facets of supports involved in regulating CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity. a , b , Regulation of the crystal facets of TiO 2 supports to tune CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity over Co or Ru/TiO 2 catalysts, where a represents anatase ( a ) and t represents rutile ( b ). c , Product selectivity of Ru/TiO 2 catalysts with different crystal facets.

Full size image These results demonstrate the importance of engineering crystal phases and planes to determine product selectivity. More extensive studies are needed to control product selectivity by engineering the crystal phases at the molecular level, which is important for obtaining the desired products. Transformation of the crystal phase under reaction conditions should be investigated to reveal the chemical states of the actual active phases. Synergistic effects Synergistic effects impact the electronic states and chemical properties of active sites as well as reaction intermediates. There can also be synergism between single atoms and NPs, interparticle interactions, metal and promoter interactions, as well as MSIs, and these can be used to tune product selectivity ( ) 37 . : Synergistic effects of metal active sites, metals and promoters, and metals and supports for regulating CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity. a , Illustration of tuning of the distance between dual active sites to regulate the synergistic effects of active sites and the hydrogen spillover, and thus product selectivity. b , Synergistic effects of metals and promoters tune the product from CH 4 to CO. c , SMSIs tune the product selectivity from CH 4 to CO. d , e , Corresponding in situ DRIFTS spectra of Rh 1 /ZrO 2 ( d ) and 1Na-Rh 1 /ZrO 2 ( e ), as well as DFT calculation results of CO 2 activation on ZrO 2 and Na-ZrO 2 surfaces. The in situ DRIFTS spectra indicate that Rh 1 /ZrO 2 has HCOO* as its intermediate, whereas 1Na-Rh 1 /ZrO 2 has COOH* and CO*. DFT calculations further demonstrate that the formation of COOH* has a higher energy barrier than that for HCOO*, and the introduction of a Na promoter would decrease the energy barrier for both COOH* and HCOO*.

Full size image Regulating the distance between Cu NPs in a CuZnAl catalyst by controlling the amount of silica has been demonstrated to tune methanol selectivity; this could be increased from 35.5 mol% to 88.9 mol% by increasing the distance 38 . This occurs because the hydrogen spillover is regulated by the distance between the Cu NPs, suppressing the RWGS reaction and thus improving methanol selectivity. This distance effect could be extended to oxide–oxide and alloy systems, and bimetallic catalysts with dual-site distances. Different distances between Co 3 O 4 and ZnO induce different remote hydrogen spillover effects and local interface confinement, allowing tuning of the selectivity ratio between CO and CH 4 as well as the catalyst reactivity (Table 1 ) 39 . Diatomic Ir 1 Pd 1 –In 2 O 3 catalysts with different dual-site distance-dependent synergistic catalysis were designed for CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol. The proximity between diatomic sites could enhance methanol selectivity to 97% under high CO 2 conversion due to rapid hydrogen spillover on the adjacent Pd and Ir sites 40 . Recently, a graphene fencing approach was reported to control multiple active sites of Fe–Co bimetallic alloy catalysts, resulting in different hydrocarbon products 41 . For example, 50.1% light olefin could be produced over Fe–Co active sites on the surface of graphene fences. However, the product changes to 43.6% liquefied petroleum gas over spatial Fe–Co NPs separated by graphene fences. The proximity effect is more obvious in bifunctional catalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation to C 2+ products, as introduced in the next section. Promotion of the main metal catalytic sites (for example, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru and Pd) with other alkali, transition metals (such as Na, K, Cs, Cu and La) and non-metallic promoters (including Si, P and graphene) also alters the reaction selectivity due to modification of the electronic and chemical properties of the catalytic metals (b ) 42 , 43 , 44 . For instance, the steric effect induced by promoters can block some active sites, hindering the adsorption of certain reaction intermediates to reduce the formation of by-products 45 . Furthermore, the electronic effect induced by electron transfer between promoters and primary metals may regulate the electronic properties and therefore the adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates. For example, alkali-ion-modified single-atom Rh 1 /ZrO 2 catalysts can switch reaction selectivity from CH 4 (~100%) to CO (>99%) by changing the surface intermediate from formate to carboxy species (Table 1 ) 46 . Na + promotes stronger electronic Rh–O interactions and enhances CO 2 /*COOH adsorption while suppressing hydrogen activation, resulting in higher CO selectivity (d–f ). Similarly, modifying Ni 3 Zn 1 C 0.7 with K can switch the major product from CH 4 to higher alcohols 47 , and a carbon buffer layer modifies the electronic properties of ZnO x –Fe 5 C 2 –Fe 3 O 4 and can enhance the ethanol yield 48 . Additionally, the promoter effect of phosphine ligands and electron acceptors (such as Bi, In, Sn and halogen elements) can also adjust product selectivity. For instance, Ni/TiO 2 modified by a P promoter and Ru/CeO 2 modified by Bi adjust the selectivity from CH 4 to CO (Table 1 ) 49 , 50 . Bimetallic architectures, from core–shell structures to ideal solutions, have become important catalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation. Ni/Co/Ga doping has promotional effects on In- or Cu-based catalysts, generating a bimetallic system and enhancing methanol synthesis. After doping <10% wt% Ni into In 2 O 3 catalysts, CO 2 conversion and methanol yield are improved 51 . The reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis over Ni-promoted In 2 O 3 has been illustrated by Cannizzaro and colleagues 52 . When Ga is introduced into the Cu/SiO 2 system, abundant Cu + –GaO x interfaces are formed, and methanol synthesis is improved 53 . Additionally, a series of core–shell catalysts, such as Ni@Au ( ), Cu@Ni ( ), Pd@Zn ( ), CoFe/Fe 3 O 4 ( ) and Cu@TiO x ( ), have been reported for CO 2 hydrogenation with excellent product selectivity. Core–shell structures can be reconstructed to an alloy surface or inverse oxide/metal configuration during reactions 54 , 55 , 58 , improving CO selectivity and highlighting that dynamic changes in surface structure should be investigated. Bimetallic solid solutions, such as M a ZrO x (M = Zn, Cd, Ga) 59 , 60 , Ni x Mg 1− x O ( ), In 2 O 3 / m -ZrO 2 ( ) and Ru x Co 1− x catalysts 63 , demonstrate different selectivities and high stabilities compared to conventional supported catalysts. ZnO–ZrO 2 is considered to be a next-generation catalyst for methanol synthesis, and its active sites have been revealed as Zn–O–Zr ( ). Solid-solution catalysts with synergetic active sites are therefore interesting for the design of future CO 2 hydrogenation catalysts. Different supports can influence MSIs and therefore regulate product selectivity. For instance, the MSI over Cu/CeO 2 is weaker than that over Cu/ZrO 2 catalysts, meaning that Cu/CeO 2 catalysts have higher Cu dispersion and more oxygen vacancies, producing *HCOO intermediates for methanol synthesis 65 . The main reaction intermediate over Cu/ZrO 2 is *COOH, generating the CO product. Therefore, MSIs can regulate structural properties to change the reaction adsorption intermediates and tune the final product selectivity. Additionally, different metal–oxide interfacial sites exhibit different *CO/*CH 3 O adsorption abilities, resulting in tunable product selectivity, as demonstrated on Ni–ZrO 2 and Ni–FeO x interfaces 66 , as well as by a comparison of Ni/ZnO with other Ni/MO x catalysts. CO 2 hydrogenation selectivity can be changed by tuning the d ‑band centre over Ni–Zn dual sites, resulting in Ni/ZnO generating more CO product instead of CH 4 , which is produced over other Ni-based catalysts (Table 1 ) 67 . SMSIs or electronic metal–support interactions (EMSIs) have been investigated for improving catalytic performance by correlating metals and supports 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 (c ). The main reason behind the effects of metal/support particle size, metal loading, metal species and metal/support crystal phases on CO 2 hydrogenation is modulation of the chemical state of the metal species and the nature of the metal–oxide interfaces induced by SMSIs or EMSIs. Li and colleagues demonstrated that the SMSI between Ir species and Ce–OH supports could tune product selectivity during CO 2 hydrogenation; metallic Ir particles were found to catalyse CH 4 production, whereas partially oxidized Ir species were favourable for CO production 73 . When Ru NPs were encapsulated by MoO 3− x overlayers or TiO x with abundant oxygen vacancies, induced by the reaction gas and SMSI, selectivity changed from CH 4 to CO (Table 1 ) 74 , 75 . Li and colleagues used NH 3 treatment to disrupt the SMSI and obtained a Ni/ a- TiO 2 -NH 3 catalyst 76 . As a result, both CO 2 conversion and CH 4 selectivity were enhanced, whereas the original Ni/ a -TiO 2 catalyst was selective for CO (Table 1 ). It has also been observed that a Ni/ZrO 2 catalyst exhibits higher low-temperature activity and CH 4 selectivity than a Ni/SiO 2 catalyst due to an enhanced local electron density of active sites, and different reaction pathways induced by SMSIs and reconstructed ZrO 2 species 77 . Dynamic SMSIs under a CO 2 hydrogenation atmosphere and different reduction temperatures have been demonstrated by a series of operando
