(a), (b) Electrocatalytic performance of Co single atom catalysts stabilized on ZIF -derived carbons for oxygen reduction to H 2O2 in acidic (0.1 M HClO 4) and (c), (d) in alkaline (0.1 M KOH) media. (e) O 1s, C 1s, and N 1s XPS spect ra and (f) Co K -edge k3-weighted FT -EXAFS of Co 1-ZIF and Co 1-ZIF(O)n real space. We applied our concepts to zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) -derived carbon. ZIF - derived carbon decorated with Co single atoms (Co 1-ZIF) was first synthesized (see Methods). Based on the concept of modified Hummers method (), we carried out acid and mild H 2O2 treatment to synthesize oxidized Co 1-ZIF catalyst ( Co1-ZIF(O) ). The oxygen content increased from 4.6 at% to 10.3 at%. Co 1-ZIF(O) showed improvement in r ing current and the H 2O2 selectivity, demonstrating that our concept is applicable to other high surface area carbon such as ZIF -derived carbon. 45 Table S1.

Activity of different catalysts was also evaluated by comparing their turn over frequency (TOF) values which consider the differences in the site density of various catalysts. TOF is the total number of molecules transformed into the desired product by one active site per time. In this study, the TOF values of catalysts were calculated for the 2e - ORR pathway to evaluate the efficiency of electrochemical H 2O2 production. The equation for deriving TOF is as follows. TOF (s-1) = (number of oxygen molecules turnover) / (number of active sites) = ( j/2F) / n j is the current density for H 2O2 production measured from ring electrode with the collection efficiency of our RRDE setup at a given overpotential, F is the faraday constant (96,485 C mol-1), and n is the number of active sites. ( j/2F) stands for the total oxygen turnover in 2e- ORR. The number of oxygen molecules turnover was calculated as follows. (number of oxygen molecules turnover) = j [mA 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐2] ｘ 1 [𝐶𝐶/𝑠𝑠] 1000 [𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚] ｘ 1 [𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑒𝑒−] 96485 [𝐶𝐶] ｘ 1 [ 𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑂𝑂2] 2 [𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑒𝑒−] ｘ (6.02ｘ1023 [𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐 𝑂𝑂2 𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑂𝑂2]) The number of active sites was calculated as follows. (number of active sites), n = L [𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐2] ｘ R [wt% ] ｘ 1 [𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ] 𝑊𝑊 [𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚] ｘ (6.02ｘ1020 [𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚]) L is the amount of catalyst loaded on the electrode, R is the weight fraction, and W is the atomic weight of the corresponding element of active sites. 49 In case of our Co1-NG(O) catalyst, the relatively electron -poor cobalt atom center (1.40 wt%) can be considered as the active site, assuming all the cobalt centers participate in the ORR reaction. Then, the TOF value at 0.65 V (vs. RHE) is calculated as follows. - (num ber of oxygen molecules turnover) = 1.55 [mA 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐2] ｘ 1 [𝐶𝐶/𝑠𝑠] 1000 [𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚] ｘ 1 [𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑒𝑒−] 96485 [𝐶𝐶] ｘ 1 [ 𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑂𝑂2] 2 [𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑒𝑒−] ｘ (6.02ｘ1023 [𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐 𝑂𝑂2 𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑂𝑂2]) = 4.84ｘ1015 [atom 𝑂𝑂2 𝑠𝑠 · 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐2] - (number of active sites) = 0.0100 [𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐2] ｘ 0.0140 ｘ 1 [𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ] 58.933 [𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚] ｘ (6.02ｘ1020 [𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐 𝐶𝐶𝑚𝑚 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚]) = 1.43ｘ1015 [atom 𝐶𝐶𝑚𝑚 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐2] Therefore, the TOF (s-1) value for the electrochemical H 2O2 production of Co 1-NG(O) is 3.38 (s-1) Similarly, the TOF values for other catalysts (e.g. ) have been derived and the result can be seen in Table S 3. For the catalysts containing noble metals, all the noble metal centers were assumed as the active sites. Also, it has been demonstrated that the carbon atoms adjacent to several oxygen functional groups can be an active site for 2e - ORR for non- metal carbon catalysts. Thus, we calculated the number of active sites on those carbon catalysts from the oxygen content of the surface. The calculated TOF value of our Co 1-NG(O) is 3.38 (s-1) which is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of other catalysts reported to date. Although this TOF value is likely to be overestimated as the carbon support materials might also participa te in the reaction, our results clearly demonstrate that the electron -poor cobalt single atom center is responsible for the high activity towards electrochemical H 2O2 production. 50 Table S 4.
