preparation of RE-Cu catalysts with similar heterostructures and can enhance the CO 2RR performance. Among them, the as-synthesized Pr-Cu catalyst exhibited unique structural features that significantly affected the product selectivity of CO 2RR. 9 Supplementary Note 3. A brief discussion about the key intermediates during CO 2RR. In general, the pathway leading to both ethylene and ethanol generation remains identical until the formation of the OCHCH 2 intermediate, which is possibly adsorbed in two manners: one is the O-terminal adsorption (*OCHCH 2) and the other is the C- terminal adsorption (*CH 2CHO)4-9. Taking insights into these adsorption configurations and corresponding reaction pathway ( Supplementary ), only the *OCHCH 2 structure can lead to a combined production of ethanol and ethylene via the subsequent C=C double bond hydrogenation, while the reaction pathway involving the *CH2CHO structure cannot efficiently deliver the ethylene production which is not consistent with the
