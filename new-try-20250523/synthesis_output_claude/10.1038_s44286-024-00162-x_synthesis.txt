Methods Synthesis of Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 CeO x /SiO 2 : the procedure for synthesizing CeO x islands on SiO 2 was reported previously 22 . SiO 2 powder (360 mg) was sonicated in 100 ml deionized water to produce a nearly homogeneous slurry. Then, 0.4 mmol Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ∙6H 2 O was added and dissolved in the solution, followed by the rapid injection of 0.8 ml NH 3 ∙H 2 O (2M) under stirring for 3 min before vacuum filtration. The resulting solid particles were separated and air-dried overnight at room temperature. The dried powders were ground into finer particles and subsequently calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C (with an initial temperature ramp of 5 °C min –1 ) for 12 h. Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg CeO x /SiO 2 in 120 ml deionized water 22 . The pH value of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 51 μmol H 2 PtCl 6 and 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. With the slurry magnetically stirred for 5 h, the platinum-containing precursor solution was slowly added into the CeO x /SiO 2 slurry. After stirring for another 2 h, the mixture was separated by vacuum filtration to give platinum-containing solid particles, which were then washed several times with deionized water. The resultant powder was calcined at 600 °C for 12 h to form the as-synthesized catalyst. Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 was reduced in flowing 10% H 2 /helium at 400 °C for 1 h to produce the Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED samples containing platinum clusters. To prepare the oxidized sample (Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -OX), the reduced Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED sample was recalcined in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 2 h. The 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 sample was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg CeO x /SiO 2 in 120 ml deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 26 μmol H 2 PtCl 6 and 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. The adsorption, calcination and reduction steps were the same as those stated above to produce the as-synthesized 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 catalyst and 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED samples containing platinum clusters. The 0.8 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 sample was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg as-synthesized Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 (0.5 wt%, calcined at 500 °C for 12 h) in 120 ml deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 26 μmol H 2 PtCl 6 and 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. The adsorption, calcination and reduction were done as stated above to produce the as-synthesized 0.8 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 catalyst and 0.8 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED samples containing platinum clusters. The 1.2 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 sample was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg as-synthesized Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 (0.5 wt%, calcined at 500 °C for 12 h) in 120 ml deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 51 μmol H 2 PtCl 6 and 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. The adsorption, calcination and reduction were done as stated above to produce the as-synthesized 1.2 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 catalyst and 1.2 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED samples containing platinum clusters. XAS XAS was performed at beamlines 4-1 and 15-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. Conventional data were collected at beamline 4-1; this is a side station on a 20-pole wiggler beamline. The ring (SPEAR3) was operated in the top-off mode; the storage ring energy was 3 GeV and the stored current was 500 mA. To minimize harmonics at the platinum L 3 edge, the double-crystal Si monochromator was detuned by 20%–30% of the maximum intensity. Ex situ spectra were collected in the fluorescence yield mode with a 30-element germanium solid-state detector array. The samples were pressed into pellets and mounted on a plate, and the data were recorded at room temperature. In operando XAS experiments were done with approximately 40 mg samples loaded in a tubular flow-through quartz cell (inside diameter, 2.8 mm) through which the treatment gases flowed 24 . HERFD-XANES experiments were performed at beamline 15-2, which is equipped with a 56-pole, 0.9 T wiggler and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled double-crystal Si monochromator for selection of the incident-beam energy. A Rowland circle spectrometer having a radius of 1 m and equipped with three spherically bent Si analyzers and a silicon drift detector were used to select the platinum L α emission line 50 . In each HERFD-XANES experiment, an approximately 40 mg sample was loaded in the flow-through cell that was fed with the treatment gas. ATHENA and ARTEMIS software 51 were used to analyze the EXAFS data. Data alignment, edge calibration, deglitching, normalization and background subtraction were performed with ATHENA. The platinum L 3 edge energy was determined by the first inflection point of the absorption edge data characterizing a platinum-foil reference, calibrated to the reported energy of 11,564.0 eV. Data fitting was performed considering k 1 , k 2 and k 3 weightings. The fitting ranges in k space and R space in the data analysis for each sample were determined by the data quality. These values were used with the Nyquist theorem for the estimation of the justified number of fitting parameters, which was not exceeded in the reported fits. The amplitude reduction factor, S 0 2 , was determined by fitting the experimental platinum-foil data, and then fixed for further analysis of the data characterizing the various samples (Supplementary and Supplementary Table 1 ). The parameters characterizing the local structure environment including the CN, scattering path distance between the absorber and backscattering atoms ( R ), mean square relative displacement (Δ σ 2 , disorder term) and inner potential correction (Δ E 0 ) were allowed to vary in the fitting. Various plausible models were considered in the fitting. The quality of fit was determined by the minimization of the R factor. Standard procedures were used in the analysis of the XANES data 51 . STEM HAADF-STEM imaging was performed with an aberration-corrected JEOL ARM-200F microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and an image resolution of 0.08 nm in the HAADF imaging mode and, separately, with a double-aberration-corrected Themis Z microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV and an image resolution of 0.06 nm. The catalyst powders were loaded on lacey-carbon-coated copper transmission electron microscopy grids, and low electron probe currents were used to reduce the electron-beam-induced effects. Infrared spectroscopy A Bruker IFS 66v spectrometer (equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT) detector) and a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT-A) detector) were used to collect the DRIFTS data characterizing the powder samples. The spectral resolution was 4 cm −1 . The cell was partly filled with approximately 50 mg of inert KBr powder, followed by adding approximately 10 mg of catalyst packed onto the KBr. The cell was connected into a flow system that allowed the recording of spectra as the reactant gases (CO (10% in helium, Airgas), helium (Praxair, UHP grade), 13 CO (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 99.5%), ethylene (Airgas, UHP grade) and/or H 2 (Airgas, UHP grade)) flowed through the cell at the desired temperature. The background spectra were recorded at room temperature for the as-synthesized Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 and Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -OX samples in the presence of flowing helium (40 ml (NTP) min –1 ). CO adsorption was conducted by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min –1 of 10% CO/helium for 30 min. The CO desorption spectra were recorded following a helium purge at a flow rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 to remove gas-phase CO from the cell. To prepare and characterize the reduced catalyst, namely, Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED, H 2 reduction treatments were conducted with the sample in the cell before CO adsorption. The cell was heated in 10% H 2 /helium flowing at 40 ml (NTP) min –1 as the temperature was ramped from room temperature to 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C min –1 followed by a dwell time of 1 h at 400 °C. Then, the cell was cooled to room temperature, and the gas feed was switched to a helium flow at 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . The background spectra were recorded at room temperature with the sample in helium flowing at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . Thereafter, CO adsorption experiments were conducted by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min –1 of 10% CO/helium for 30 min. The CO desorption spectra were recorded during a helium purge at a flow rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . In 13 CO adsorption experiments, the background spectra were recorded at room temperature with helium flowing through the cell at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . 13 CO adsorption was conducted by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min –1 of 25% 13 CO/helium for 20 min. 13 CO desorption spectra were recorded during the flow of helium purge gas at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 ; this treatment removed gas-phase 13 CO from the cell. To characterize the performance of the used Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 sample, the catalytic reaction was carried out with the sample in the DRIFTS cell in a mixture of H 2 flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min –1 + ethylene flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min –1 + helium flowing at 32 ml (NTP) min –1 at 70 °C; the pressure was atmospheric, and the run continued for 176 h. Then, the cell was cooled to room temperature, and the gas feed was switched to helium flowing at 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . The background spectra were recorded at room temperature with helium flowing through the cell at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 . Thereafter, CO adsorption was investigated by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min –1 of 10% CO/helium for 30 min. CO desorption spectra were recorded during a helium purge at a flow rate of 40 ml (NTP) min –1 to remove gas-phase CO from the cell. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry The platinum loading of each catalyst sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, performed using a Thermo Scientific XSERIES 2 instrument. XPS measurements The XPS measurements were performed with a K-Alpha Plus XPS/UPS analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1,486.6 eV) with the samples placed in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber. The system reached a stable pressure, typically in the mid 10 −10 torr range, after ~12 h without the sample, or in the 10 −8 torr range with the sample present. Samples were mounted on conductive silver tape. A vacuum transfer module was used to transfer samples directly from a glove box to the XPS chamber without air exposure. A flood gun was used during the measurements to dynamically compensate for sample charging. A step size of 0.1 eV and a pass energy of 50 eV were used for each spectrum. The spectra were calibrated by setting the Si 2 p signal of SiO 2 to 103.4 eV ( ). CasaXPS software version 2.3.25 was used for further data calibration and processing. XRD crystallography XRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a Philips X’Pert Pro Super diffractometer, equipped with a monochromatized Cu Kα radiation source at a wavelength of 0.1542 nm. Ethylene hydrogenation catalysis in a conventional flow reactor Ethylene hydrogenation catalysis experiments were done with a once-through temperature-controlled tubular plug-flow reactor (inside diameter, 4 mm) at various temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The products were analyzed with an online Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 50 m × 0.53 mm PLOT Alumina ‘M’ capillary column. Samples of the catalyst (Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 and Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED) powder (12 mg) mixed with 500 mg of inert non-porous α-Al 2 O 3 particles were loaded into the reactor, with the upstream and downstream sections packed with quartz wool. The catalyst masses were 12 mg and 6 mg for 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED and 1.2 wt% Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED, respectively, and the catalyst powders were mixed with 500 mg of inert non-porous α-Al 2 O 3 powders. In these catalysis experiments, the feed was a mixture of H 2 flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min –1 + ethylene flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min –1 + helium flowing at 32 ml (NTP) min –1 . The values of near-steady-state TOF were determined directly from the conversions of ethylene, which were <5.0% and shown to be differential 53 . After each catalyst reached steady-state operation, no substantial deactivation was observed at longer times on stream (176 h). Thereafter, the catalytic reaction experiments were carried out at various temperatures with the same feed gas to provide near-steady-state conversions at various temperatures. Each reported catalytic reaction rate (TOF) at each temperature is based on data from approximately 8 h of near-steady-state operation. n -Hexadecane hydrocracking n -Hexadecane hydrocracking was carried out in a stirred 50 ml Hastelloy slurry reactor at 260 °C for 6 h. In a typical test, the reactor was flushed with H 2 ten times to remove any residual air after the addition of 200 mg of catalyst (100 mg Pt/CeO x /SiO 2 -RED + 100 mg HY zeolite (Si:Al = 40, atomic)) and 2.00 g of n -hexadecane. HY zeolite was pretreated by calcination at 500 °C for 5 h. The reactor was pressurized with 3.0 MPa of H 2 at room temperature and heated and held at 260 °C for 6 h. The gas phase and products dissolved in n -hexadecane were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-2014). Computational methods Spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package code at the generalized gradient approximation level within the projector augmented wave/Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof formalism 54 , 55 . Hubbard U ( U eff = 5.0 eV) with effective on-site Coulomb interaction correction was used for the strongly correlated 4 f electrons of cerium 56 . A CeO 2 slab model (11.5 Å × 13.3 Å) with three triatomic layers was adopted to investigate the evolution of interfacial structures from that incorporating isolated single Pt 1 O x species to Pt n clusters. The total energy calculations were performed using a 2 × 2 × 1 grid and a plane-wave cut-off energy of 400 eV. A vacuum space greater than 15 Å was added in the z direction to avoid interaction with each slab. Atoms in the bottom triatomic layer of a catalyst model were fixed, and all the other atoms, including adsorbates, were allowed to relax until the force on each ion was less than 0.02 eV Å –1 . The cohesive energy ( E coh ) is defined as E coh = E clusters+slab – E slab – n * E Pt1 , where E clusters+slab , E slab , n and E Pt1 are the Gibbs free energy of optimized Pt n /CeO 2 and Gibbs free energy of optimized CeO 2 , the nuclearity of the platinum clusters and the energy of an isolated single platinum atom, respectively. To check the stability of the candidate cluster structures under the experimental conditions, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed. The selected structures after the standard structure optimization calculations were used to run the AIMD simulations for a period of 3 ps at 400 °C by setting the canonical ensemble ( NVT ) with a Nose–Hoover thermostat. Then, the generated configurations were further optimized using standard DFT calculations to demonstrate the stability. The optimal adsorption configurations of the reactants (C 2 H 4 and H 2 ) on the selective Pt 1 O 5 H and Pt n clusters were searched. The adsorption energy ( E ads ) is defined as E ads = E adsorb/surf – E surf – E adsorb , where E adsorb/surf , E surf and E adsorb represent the total energies of the slab with adsorbate(s), the clean slab and the isolated adsorbate, respectively. For each elementary step in C 2 H 4 hydrogenation, the initial and final states were first optimized. The transition states were then searched using both the climbing image nudged elastic band method and the complete linear/quadratic synchronous transit method 57 , 58 . The accuracy of the transition states was confirmed by analyzing the vibrational frequencies. The Gibbs free energy change is defined as Δ G = Δ E + ΔZPE – T Δ S , where Δ E is obtained from DFT calculations and ΔZPE is the correction in zero-point energies.
