A distinct color change from sage-green of Co(acac) 3@ZIF -8(1.27) to light-purple of Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27) is observed after the acac versus mIm ligand -exchange.

(d) Summary of current density degradation (%) at 0.85 V for the durability tests. Test condition s: 1.0 bar H 2/O2; 80 °C; 70% RH . Cycling the fuel cells in H 2/O2 and at low cell voltages leads to a significant cell performance decay due to the higher rates of radical formation and more attack of the catalyst. We thus, believe that radical -induced oxidation of catalyst to form CO 2 and surface oxygen -containing functional groups , e.g., -OOH, -OH, etc. is one of the main degradation mechanisms of PGM -free M -N-C (M : Fe and Co) catalysts under normal fuel cell operations. This is consistent with previous results from Zelenay18 (LANL) showing that radicals are the most probable intermediates causing catalyst degradation: in H 2/O2, lower fuel voltage s (i.e., more H 2O2 and thus more radicals) causing a faster degradation, and slower degradation in H 2/air due to lower O 2 concentration (i.e., less H2O2 and thus less radicals). a b c d0.0 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.40.00.20.40.60.81.0Cell Voltage (V) Current Density (A cm-2)Co(mIm)-NC(1.0) 0.80 V_55 min; 0.85 V_ 5 min 50 CyclesCo(mIm)-NC(1.0) 0.65 V_55 min; 0.85 V_ 5 min 50 Cycles Co(mIm)-NC(1.0) 0.40 V_55 min; 0.85 V_ 5 min 50 Cycles BoL EoL H2/N2 EoL H2/O2 BoL EoL H2/N2 EoL H2/O2HFR (mW cm-2) 500100015002000 2000 1500 1000 500 500100015002000 0.0 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.40.00.20.40.60.81.0Cell Voltage (V) Current Density (A cm-2) BoL EoL H2/N2 EoL H2/O2 HFR (mW cm-2)0.0 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.40.00.20.40.60.81.0Cell Voltage (V) Current Density (A cm-2) HFR (mW cm-2) 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.82030405060Degradation at 0.85 V (%) Holding Voltage (V)Degradation % in 1.0 bar H2/O2 0.40 V _55 min 0.85 V_5 min0.65 V _55 min 0.85 V_5 min 0.80 V _55 min 0.85 V_5 min 21 Supplementary | (a) Steady -state ORR polarization curves and (b) H 2O2% on Co(mIm) - NC(1.0) before and after the acidic heat-treatment in Ar-saturated 5% H 2O2+0.5 M H 2SO 4 solution.

Notably, after acidic H 2O2-treatment, the ORR activity and H 2O2% of Co(mIm) - NC(1.0) degraded much less than that of Fe(mIm) -NC(1.0) , which is likely due to the lower activity of Co for the Fenton reaction s.20 a b d c0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8-4-3-2-10Current Density (mA cm-2) Potential (V versus RHE) Initial 5% H2O2 + 0.5 M H2SO4 80 °C, 2 HoursCo(mIm)-NC(1.0) DE1/2: 8 mV E1/2: 0.82 VE1/2: 0.84 V 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8-4-3-2-10Current Density (mA cm-2) Potential (V versus RHE)Fe(mIm)-NC(1.0) DE1/2: 28 mV 0.5 M H2SO4 Initial 5% H2O2 + 0.5 M H2SO4 80 °C, 2 Hours0.2 0.4 0.6 0.801234H2O2 yield (%) Potential (V versus RHE)Ring: 1.3 V versus RHE Co(mIm)-NC(1.0) Initial 5% H2O2 + 0.5 M H2SO4 80 °C, 2 Hours 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.801234H2O2 yield (%) Potential (V versus RHE)Ring: 1.3 V versus RHE Initial 5% H2O2 + 0.5 M H2SO4 80 °C, 2 HoursFe(mIm)-NC(1.0) 22 Supplementary | Decay of ORR activity following electrochemical cycled between 0.6 - 1.0 V (versus RHE) in Ar- or O 2-purged 0.5 M H2SO 4 solution at 25 °C and 80 °C for (a) Co(mIm) -NC(1.0) and ( b) Fe(mIm) -NC(1.0) . a b 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8-4-3-2-10Current Density (mA cm-2) Potential (V versus RHE) Initial Ar, 25 °C O2, 25 °C O2, 80 °C 0.5 M H2SO4E1/2: 0.82 VCo(mIm)-NC(1.0) 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8-4-3-2-10Current Density (mA cm-2) Potential (V versus RHE) Initial Ar, 25 °C O2, 25 °C O2, 80 °C 0.5 M H2SO4E1/2: 0.84 VFe(mIm)-NC(1.0) 23 Supplementary | Atomistic structures of simulation models for leaching of the central M atom s in porphyrin -like MN 4C12 (M: Fe/Co) sites with the M-N bond length of 2.01 Å.

Each technique has its own advantages and limitations. XPS is a relatively surface sensitive technique with a detection depth of only few nanometers ; due to the highly nano -porous structures of our catalysts, the metal content detected by XPS is slightly lower than the real content in the catalysts. Different from XPS, EDS mapping is more a bulk analysis technique . As for the ICP -OES analysis, it can determine all the metal species in the materials , which is the most accurate technique for elemental analysis. The ICP-OES results reveals that Co(mIm) - NC(1.0) and Fe(mIm) -NC(1.0) have almost the same metal content. 29 Supplementary Table 3 | Elemental quantification determined by ICP -OES for Co(acac) 3@ZIF - 8(1.27), Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27), and Fe(mIm)4@ZIF -8(1.27) precursors and Co(mIm) -NC(1.0) and Fe(mIm) -NC(1.0) catalysts .

All the pores in ZIF -8 are micropores with a pore diameter of 11 .6 Å1. Form these data, we calculate d the number of micropores (N1) in ZIF -8 and the number of micropores in the catalysts’ precursors been filled with Co (N2) using the following equation s: 𝐍𝟏=𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑒4 3𝜋𝑅3⁄ 𝐍𝟐=(1.0wt% )NAM⁄ where, M is the molar mass of Co (58.93 g mol-1) and N A is the Avogadro constant . Therefore, the percentage (%) of micro pores in ZIF -8 that is filled with the Co complexes in the two precursors (N2/N1) are calculated to be 20.10% for Co(acac) 3@ZIF -8(1.27) and 20. 22% for Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27) , suggesting there is still much room to increase Co content in the precursors. The possible ways to increase Co encapsulation in ZIF -8 pores include adjust reaction temperature to control ZIF -8 growth rate, change solvent to increase Co(acac) 3 solubility, introduce larger linker to create bigger micropores in ZIF -8, and use smaller Co molecules as Co precursor, etc. These are under investigation now. 30 Supplementary Table 4 | Fitting parameters of Co K -edge EXAFS data for the Co@ZIF -8(1.27) precursors , the derived Co-N-C(1.0) catalysts , and the reference compounds .

This value of S02 was used to estimate the CN for each of the scattering paths from the fit value of CN*S02. β A uniform threshold energy of 7714.4 eV was used when extracting the EXAFS of the pyrolyzed samples. In the fits of these samples the E0 of the Co -Co paths was fixed at the value determined from the metal foil when a threshold energy of 7714.4 eV was used. The EXAFS fitting results and the Fourier Transforms show that the pyrolyzed catalysts do contain metal nanoparticles (NPs) with the fraction of Co in metal NPs being higher for Co(acac) -NC(1.0) than for Co(mIm) -NC(1.0), consistent with the PXRD result s showing a small Co metal diffraction peak for Co(acac) -NC(1.0) (Supplementary b). However, given the small Co -Co CN and the XANES features indicative of the atomically -dispersed catalysts , Co metal N Ps constitutes a minor fraction of the overall composition of these catalysts.

The Δ H for the M leaching process has been calculated directly from the DFT energy calculations. The Δ S for the M leaching process has been calculated by mainly considering the contributions from the vibration of the MN 4 sites before and after M leaching. In our molecular vibration frequency calculations, all the C and N atoms in the graphene layer were fixed, while the centr al metal Fe/Co and their adsorbates were allowed to make vibrational motion. Specifically, we used the following equations to calculate the entropy (S), zero-point energy (ZPE) and heat capacity corrections (C) for a given structure.

Best analytical proof for the Co(acac) 3 and Co(mIm) 4 encapsulation in ZIF -8 pores is provided by comparison of PXRD Fourier difference maps of the precursor s,47 which are generated with Topas using the difference ( Fobs - Fcal) between structure factors, which in turn is based on the difference between observed and calculated diffracted intensities. PXRD data were collected between 2 -100° 2 θ with a step size of 0.01°. Rietveld fits were conducted using T opas V6 (Bruker AXS) wit h peak shapes calculated by the fundamental parameter method.48 Atomic coordinates obtained from the bare ZIF -8 structure reported by Novakovic et al.49 were fixed during fitting. The cubic unit cell dimension, sample broadening parameters, scale factor, and a Chebyshev polynomial background were all fitted to obtain the best match between experimental and calculated patterns. This method is commonly applied in diffraction studies to locate additional atoms not included in the refinement and provides a three -dimensional image of electron density. The process is similar to the d ifference envelope density reported by Yakovenko et al.,47 but uses a larger set of structure factors. As shown in Supplementary b, the regions of the highest positive residual electron density are shown and correspond to the positions of atoms. The regions of the negative elect ron density are not given as these arise from the Rietveld fitting procedure in which positive and negative misfits balance to give the lowest overall residual sum of squares. The residual positive electron density map for bare ZIF -8 (Supplementary b -i) shows regions of positive electron density near those smaller 4 - membered pores openings. These are likely caused by crystal defects and deformation in the as - synthesized ZIF -8. Atmospheric gases adsorbed into ZIF -8 pores might also contribute some smal l electron density difference since the PXRD experiments were conducted under ambient conditions. Additional positive electron densities at the center of the pores were observed for Co(acac) 3@ZIF -8(1.27) (Supplementary b -ii) and is likely to arise fr om encapsulation of Co(acac) 3 in pores because only the atoms ( or species) inside the periodic ZIF -8 pores will significantly contribute to the electron density shown here. The detailed analysis of the geometry of the “guest molecule s” is challenging given the partial occupancy (ca. 20%, Supplementary Table 3) and likely orientational disorder; however, the comparison with the bare ZIF -8 map strongly suggests Co(acac) 3 molecules occupy a fraction of ZIF -8’s micro pores. In Supplementary b -iii, the Four ier difference map of Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27) seems to has less residual electron density when compared with that of Co(acac) 3@ZIF -8(1.27), but it still show higher positive residual electron density when compared with bare ZIF -8, indicating Co(mIm) 4 species occupies a fraction of ZIF -8 pores. A possible reason for the less residual electron density than that of Co(acac) 3@ZIF -8(1.27) is that Co(mIm) 4 species in Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27) is relatively more orientational disordered and dimensional varied (see Supplementary ); The orientational and/or dimensional variations of Co(mIm) 4 generated some randomness in the resulting species in ZIF -8 pores which will cancel out some of the residue electron density due to less periodicity. 35 Supplementary Discussio n 2 | XAS analysis of catalyst precursors . As shown in Supplementary a, the differences in the Co K -edge XANES spectra reveal that Co has different coordination environments in the two different precursors, Co(acac) 3@ZIF - 8(1.27) and Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27). The XANES spectra for Co(acac) 3@ZIF -8(1.27) and bare Co(acac) 3 (reference sample) show nearly identical features, indicating that Co in Co(acac) 3@ZIF -8(1.27) is in the coordination environment that is similar to that of in the Co(acac) 3 standard. The edge -energy of Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27) is similar to that of CoII(NO 3)2·6H2O, indicating that the oxidation state of Co in Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27) is 2+. The reduction of CoIII of Co(acac) 3 to CoII of Co(mIm) 4 is likely caused by the de -protonation/de - electronation of the mIm ligand during the ligand -exchange process,50 as proposed and shown in Supplementary b. The energy of the Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27) pre -edge peak (7708.8 eV) is 0.5 eV lower than that of the Co(II)(NO 3)2·6H2O (7709.3 eV) and the peak is more intense (Supplementary b). These differences are indicative of Co being in a less centrosymmetric environment in Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27) than in Co(NO 3)2·6H2O. The EXAFS fitting results of Co(mIm) 4@ZIF - 8(1.27) showed an unrealistically large Co coordination number ( CN) and a large Debye -Waller (σ2) factor indicating that there are two different Co scattering paths with slightly different bond lengths (Supplementary Table 4); the pre -edge intensity a nd energy of Co(mIm) 4@ZIF -8(1.27) are however consistent with Co being in a tetrahedral51 rather than in an octahedral coordination. The p -d mixing resulting from the tetrahedral coordination (geometry) increases the intensity of the pre -edge and the lower energy of the t 2 orbitals compared to t he e g orbitals in the octahedron shift the feature to the lower energy.33 These results are consistent with the valence state and coordination structure of Co in the published structure of Co(mIm) 4 (i.e., 2+ and tetrahedral geometry).52 36 Supplementary Discussion 3 | EXAFS fitting results for catalysts. As shown in Supplementary , Co EXAFS spectra for both Co(mIm) -NC(1.0) and Co(acac) - NC(1.0) show one dominant peak at R < 2 Å, which can be attributed to scattering from relatively light element such as N, C, O. This peak was best fit with the Co -N scattering path (Supplementary Table 4) and the edge energ ies observed in the XANES spectra for th e two catalysts are consistent with the N rather than the O coordination. The Fourier -transforms ( FT) for th ose two catalysts also show a peak at R > 2 Å that can be fit to the Co-Co scattering path (Supplementary Table 4); this Co -Co scattering path is much more prevalent in the Co(acac) - NC(1.0), suggesting that Co species giving rise to this scattering path constitutes a larger fraction of the total Co in Co(acac) -NC(1.0) than in Co(mIm) -NC(1.0). This is further reflec ted in the larger Co -Co coordination number (CN) of Co(acac) -NC(1.0) than Co(mIm) -NC(1.0) (i.e., 1.3 for Co(acac) -NC(1.0) and 0.5 for Co(mIm) -NC(1.0)). The mean bond length of 2.49 ± 0.01 Å for this peak and comparison of the imaginary components of the FT s to that of metallic Co foil (not given) show that this Co -Co scattering path arises from Co metal nanoparticles (NPs). The second shell scattering peaks between 3 -6 Å in the FTs for Co(acac) -NC(1.0), which are absent in the FTs for Co(mIm) -NC(1.0), indic ate that the Co NPs are larger in Co(acac) -NC(1.0) than that in Co(mIm) -NC(1.0). Comparing the Co -Co CN of th ose two catalysts to that for Co metal (CN = 12) indicates that Co in Co metal NP s constitutes a minor fraction of the total Co content of 0.5/12 = 0.04 (or ~4% ) for Co(mIm) -NC(1.0) and ~11% for Co(acac) -NC(1.0). 37 Supplementary Discussion 4 | Structure identification of FeNx site in Fe(mIm) -NC(1.0) catalyst . 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopic analysis of the Fe(mIm) -NC(1.0) catalyst (Supplementary a ) reveals that the majority of FeN x active sites in Fe(mIm) -NC(1.0) is in D1: porphyrin -like FeN 4C12 (Supplementary b) (and minor in D3: pyridinic -N-based FeN 2+2C4+4, Supplementary c ) structures . This result is consistent with previous results of Kramm53, 54 and Jaouen11, 55 that highly active Fe -N-C consists mainly the (D1+D3 ) active sites. This indicates that, because of the identical synthesis method, the majority of the catalytic active sites in Co(mIm) -NC(1.0) is likely the porphyrin -like CoN 4C12. We notice that result from literature (Nat. Mater. 14, 937 -94211; Nat. Commun. 8, 957 -96710; Nat. Catal. 1, 63 - 7256) also shows the similar active site structures of Co -N-C versus Fe -N-C from same synthesis. Furthermore, we have compared our experimental XANES result with the XANES simulations of Zitolo et al. ( Nat. Mater. 14, 937 -94211). The XANES result of Fe(mIm) -NC(1.0) is similar to that of Zitolo et al. Thus, as concluded by Zitolo et al., the best match of the XANES simulatio ns for FeN x is in the porphyrinic coordination environment, i.e., FeN 4C12, as shown in Supplementary d -e from Zitolo et al. 38 Supplementa ry References 1.
