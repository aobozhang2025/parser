synthesis of SA/hydrogenated ZnO. The magnitude of the y-axis in the above EPR data is identical. a, The EPR data of pristine ZnO and Pt -DSA/ZnO. The intensity of the original EPR signal related to bulk V O diminished after Pt deposition, which is the evidence of photo -induced surface V O consumption upon Pt deposition (b). This decrease in signal could provide evidence of a specific interaction between exerted metal atoms and the surface V O on the support. b, After the reduction in an H 2/Ar atmosphere, the total intensity of the EPR signal related to V O decreased significantly. Fu rthermore, there was no diminution in the VO signal after Pt deposition. 6 Supplementary | XPS spectra of M (Pt, Ir and Cu) -SA/hydrogenated ZnO. a, XPS spectra of Pt -SA/hydrogenated ZnO (a pink line is Al 2p signal which comes from residual Al in commercial ZnO (Supplementary b) show that the Pt peak shifted 0.1 eV higher compared to Pt -DSA/ZnO. This shift could indicate weaker interaction between Pt and surface of hydrogenated ZnO compared to Pt -DSA/ZnO. b, XPS spectra of Ir -SA/h ydrogenated ZnO show that the Ir peak shifted 0.16 eV lower compared to Ir -DSA/ZnO. This shift indicate s Irδ+ have more electron deficient state compared to Irδ+ in Ir-DSA/ZnO (in Ir XPS , Ir4+ peak occur lower energy than Ir3+)1,2. c, XPS spectra of Cu -SA/hydrogenated ZnO show that , in this case, the XPS peaks have almost the same energy as Cu -DSA/ZnO due to the similar size and electronic structure of Cu and Zn atoms. 7 Supplementary | The pictures of synthesized M (Pt, Ir and Cu) -DSA/ZnO and M - SA/hydrogenated Zn O. a, The pictures of the synthesized Pt -DSA (left), Ir -DSA (middle ) and Cu-DSA/ ZnO (right) . b, The pictures of the synthesized Pt -SA (left), Ir -SA (middle) and Cu - SA/hydrogenated ZnO (right). In the synthetic procedures of both M -DSA/ZnO and M - SA/hydrogenated ZnO, we used identical precursor concentrations and stabilization times. 8 Supplementary | Comparing the EPR data between DSA/CeO 2 formation and the conventional wet -impregnation synthesis of SA/hydrogenated CeO 2. The magnitude of the y-axis in the above EPR data is identical. a, The EPR data of pristine Ce O2 and Pt -DSA /CeO2. The intensity of the original EPR signal s related to Ce3+ and especially Ce3+-O--Ce4+ decreased after Pt deposition, which is the evidence of photo -induced surface V O consumption upon Pt deposition ( c ). This decrease in signal could provide evi dence of a specific interaction between exerted metal atoms and the surface V O on the support. b, After the reduction in an H2/Ar atmosphere, the total intensity of the EPR signal s decreased significantly. Fu rthermore, there was no diminution in the EPR signal s after Pt deposition. 9 Supplementary | XPS spectra of M (Pt, Ir and Cu) -SA/hydrogenated CeO 2. a, XPS spectra of Pt -SA/hydrogenated CeO 2 show that the Pt4+ peak occur, which is absent in Pt - DSA/CeO 2. The presence of the Pt4+ state could indicate weaker interaction between Pt and surface of hydrogenated CeO 2 compared to Pt-DSA/Ce O2. b, XPS spectra of Ir - SA/hydrogenated CeO 2 show similar peak energy compared to Ir-DSA/ZnO. c, XPS spectra of Cu-SA/hydrogenated Ce O2 (a pink line is signal which comes from residual elements in commercial CeO 2 (Supplementary d) show that the Cu peak shifted 0.4 eV lower compared to Cu -DSA/CeO 2. This shift indicates that a Cu agglomerate could have formed, displaying a metallic Cu XPS peak. 10 Supplementary | The pictures of synthesized M (Pt, Ir and Cu) -DSA/CeO 2 and M - SA/hydrogenated CeO 2. a, The pictures of the synthesized Pt -DSA (left), Ir -DSA (middle) and Cu -DSA/CeO 2 (right). b, The pictures of the synthesized Pt -SA (left), Ir -SA (middle) and Cu-SA/hydrogenated CeO 2 (right). In the synthetic procedures of both M -DSA/CeO 2 and M - SA/hydrogenated CeO 2, we used identical precursor concentrations and stabilization times. 11 Supplementary information references 1.
