Mass -transfer limitation tests for (a) external diffusion and (b) internal diffusion. dp refers to catalyst particle diameter. Supplementary Note 2 Supplementary (a) was obtained by varying feed flow rate, while keeping other operating conditions including contact time unchanged. It indicates that for feed flow rate > 5 ml/min, no significant external mass transfer effect exists. By varying only packed catalyst particle diameter (dp) in the range of 100 micron < dp < 1000 micron , Supplem entary (b) was obtained. It shows that when dp < 150 micron (corresponding to 100 mesh), internal mass transfer effect was negligible. Thus, dp < 150 micron and feed flow rate > 5 ml/min were used in all experiments. 15 Supplementary . Reaction network of NOCM over Pt/Mo 2TiC 2Tx catalysts. Supplementary Note 3 The equilibrium methane conversion was calculated based on the standard Gibbs formation energy of chemical species, provided by the NIST JANAF database (http://kinetics.nist.gov/janaf/) and the Aspen plus 8.8 software package. i) We consider a reaction network in Supplementary , including three individual reactions as follows, r 1: methane (CH 4) coupling to ethane (C 2H6); r2: ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene (C2H4); and r 3: methane direct coupling to ethylene. Note that t here are only two independent reactions among the three reactions, e.g., r 1+r2=r3. Thermodynamically, the equilibrium conversion of r 1 does not change with the methane partial pressure (r 1 is an equimolar reaction) and only reaches ~3% at 750 °C. The equilibrium conversion of r 2, as a consecutive reaction of r 1, however, is highly elevated to >99.9% at 0.01 atm CH 4 and 750 °C. It indicates that ethane ( C2H6) is thermodynamically unstable, w hich tends to dehydrogenate to a more stable species ethylene (C2H4). Therefore, the equilibrium conversion of r 3, i.e., r 1+r2, approaches to 24.3%. Note that both ethane and ethylene are experimentally observed, depending on the kinetics of reactions r 1 to r3, although ethylene is more stable than ethane. ii) Although the thermodynamic calculations and analysis were carried out above, experimental measurements of the catalytic performance are still required to better understand the NOCM reaction network. In Supplementary Table 5, reactant feeds, operating conditions and results of the tests are summarized. Test #1 in Supplementary Table 5 is shown in (c). Based on Test #1, a new reaction network in Supplementary including forward (r+1, r+2, r+3) and reverse (r-1, r-2, r-3) reactions is proposed. To investigate potential reverse reactions, i.e., r-1, r-2, and r-3, we have conducted a series of additional experiments to test 0.5% Pt/Mo 2TiC 2Tx catalysts in the temperature range 700 -780 °C ( Supplementary Table 5) . 16 In Test #2, a mixture of 0.5 % C 2H6 and 0.5 % H 2 (the highest ethane /H2 concentration from 1% CH 4, balanced with N 2) was fed. C 2H4 was then detected, and importantly, no methane was detected. This result indicates that the rate of e thane dehydrogenation is much greater than the decomposition rate of ethane to methane, i.e., r+2 >> r-1. In Test #3, a mixture of 0.5 % C 2H4 and 1 % H 2 was fed (the highest ethylene and hydrogen concentrations from 1% CH 4). No new species such as ethane o r methane were observed, indicating that neither ethylene hydrogenation nor ethylene decomposition to methane occurred, i.e., r-2 = r-3 = 0. In Test #4, methane concentration was varied in the range of 0.2 -0.5 % with balanced N 2, no ethylene was detected, but ethane at lower concentration (as compared with 1% CH 4 feed) was detected. This observation presents that ethylene is likely formed from ethane (r+2), not directly from methane (r+3). It should be noted that the NOCM pathway via C 2H6 as an in termediate (r 1 and r 2) is consistent with our Mass Spec measurement and DFT calculations. Additionally, same observations were obtained for 0.5% Pt/Mo 2TiC 2Tx catalysts tested at 700 °C (Test #5 to Test #8) and 780 °C (Test #9 to Test #12) with the same fee ds. In conclusion, a consecutive reaction network including r 1 (methane coupling to ethane and H 2) and r 2 (ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene) is proposed. Although the equilibrium conversion of methane to ethane is about 3%, methane conversion may be ove r 3% as ethane tends to dehydrogenate to ethylene, which drives the overall equilibrium starting from methane. Experimentally, methane direct coupling to ethylene, and the reverse reactions of methane coupling to ethane and ethane dehydrogenation to ethyle ne are not observed for Pt/Mo 2TiC 2Tx catalysts tested at the operating condition of interest. Due to the absence of r-1, r-2, r+3 and r-3, the reaction network can be simplified into: CH4 r1→C2H6r2→𝐶2𝐻4 In the investigated temperature range (700 -780 °C), both reactions are determined to be first -order reactions (Supplementary ). The reaction rates can be expressed by the power rate law given below: −𝑑𝐹𝐶𝐻4 𝑑𝑊=−𝑟1=𝑘1×𝑃𝐶𝐻4 𝑑𝐹𝐶2𝐻6 𝑑𝑊=𝑟1−𝑟2=𝑘1×𝑃𝐶𝐻4−𝑘2𝑃𝐶2𝐻6 𝑑𝐹𝐶2𝐻4 𝑑𝑊=𝑟2=𝑘2×𝑃𝐶2𝐻6 The reaction rates of methane coupling to ethane (r 1) and ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene (r 2) are described by Supplementa ry Equations ( 7-9), in which only two equations are independent. Based on Supplementary Equation ( 7) and , r1 is a function of methane partial pressure ( 𝑃𝐶𝐻4), while r 2 is a function of ethane partial pressure ( 𝑃𝐶2𝐻6). F is the mole flow rate, and W is the weight of catalysts packed in the flow reactor. 17 Supplementary .
