Methods Preparation of catalysts For 0.25% Pt/α-MoC, samples with 0.25 wt% Pt loading were prepared using the wetness impregnation method with passivated α-MoC as support 21 . The slurry was stirred for 2 h under Ar protection. The liquid was removed using a rotary evaporator under vacuum at 35 °C. Finally, the powder was put in a frozen dryer overnight to remove the residual moisture. Ru/Al 2 O 3 and 0.5% Pt/TiO 2 were prepared using a similar method. For 0.5% Pt/C (reference catalyst), the 5% Pt/C commercial catalyst (Alfa-Aesar) was diluted using Vulcan XC-72. For 0.08% Pt 1 /FeO x , an aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid and ferric nitrate (Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O, 1 mol l −1 ) was co-precipitated, with the pH value of the resulting solution controlled at about 8 by sodium carbonate at 50 °C. The recovered solid was dried at 60 °C overnight and calcined at 400 °C for 5 h. Before characterization and reactivity testing, the samples were reduced in 10% H 2 /He at 250 °C for 0.5 h 18 , 27 . This catalyst was provided by B. Qiao as used in a previous study 18 .
