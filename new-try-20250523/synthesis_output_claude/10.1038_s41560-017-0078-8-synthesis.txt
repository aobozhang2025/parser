synthesis of A -Ni-NSG catalyst. a, Survey spectra, b, Ni 2p, c, N 1s, and d, S 2p. SCN represents S doped C 3N4 and Ni-SCN represents S and Ni co -doped C 3N4. The formation mechanism of the Ni catalysts. Initially, melamine was polymerized to form carbon nitride while the Ni2+ reacted with the nitrogen group ( -NH 2) of melamine and the amino acid (and thiol groups on L -cysteine), which donated the lone pair electron (by allowing electron delocalization over the ligand Ï€ system) to an electrophile (Ni center atom) to reduce the N i2+ to low - oxidation- state metal centers. Subsequently, at high temperature, the unit s of Ni atoms that were stabilized by nitrogen (and/or sulfur) atoms act as the center to catalyze the growth of graphene sheets and form the final product. X -ray photoele ctron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements as shown in Supplementary provide evidences for the formation of Ni -N (~399.7 eV) and Ni -S bonds at 500 oC, indicating formation of S and Ni co-doped C 3N4 (Ni-SCN) as the intermediate state during the Ni(I) c atalyst formation process . 4 Supplementary .
