Catalyst preparation Supported Pt catalysts with different Pt loadings (0.05, 0.08, 0.2 and 0.5 wt%) were synthesized using the wet-impregnation method. The dried materials were then heat treated in a number of ways and tested for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-NS. For a typical catalyst preparation (2 g), the requisite amount of aqueous hydrogen hexachloroplatinic acid solution (9.6 mg Pt ml –1 , assay 30.21% H 2 PtCl 6 , Johnson Matthey) was diluted to 16 ml using deionized water, and heated in an oil bath to 60 °C with vigorous stirring (800 r.p.m.) before the addition of the requisite amount of support (TiO 2 , Evonik P25). The temperature was subsequently increased to 95 °C for 16 h to dry the slurry in air. The resultant material was then ground thoroughly (referred to as the ‘fresh dried-only’ sample). A portion (500 mg) of the dried-only sample was either calcined in static air or reduced under a steady flow of 5% H 2 /Ar. Heat treatments were carried out at 450 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min −1 . All of these materials were tested as catalysts without any further treatment unless stated otherwise. Hydrogenation of 3-NS Liquid phase chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-NS was performed in a 50 ml round-bottomed glass Colaver reactor. In a typical reaction, 3-NS (0.2 ml), toluene (8 ml) and catalyst (50 mg) were charged in the reactor that was then purged with N 2 to remove traces of air before being immersed in an oil bath set at 40 °C. After purging the reactor three times with 3 bar H 2 while stirring, the reaction was commenced. After a pre-determined reaction time, the reactor was cooled to <5 °C using ice, after which aliquots of the reaction mixture were collected and centrifuged to remove the solid catalyst. The liquid reaction mixture (1 ml) was added to a gas chromatography vial together with a fixed amount of external standard o -xylene (0.1 ml) for further quantitative analysis. The determination of the conversion was performed using a Varian 450-GC gas chromatograph equipped with a HP-5ms boiling-point column, a flame ionization detector and a CP8400 Autosampler. Conversion of the substrate and product selectivity were calculated using suitable calibration plots and response factors. Catalyst
