catalyst preparation, the support powder was calcined in air at 400 oC for 10 h, then stored in dark vacuum. All other chemicals, including Au(OH) 3, HAuCl 4, NaOH pellets, and (NH 4)2CO 3, were supplied by Alfar Aesar. The Au/TiO 2 sample made by deposition precipitation (DP) was used as reference. Typically, 150 mL of HAuCl 4 aqueous solution was added into a 250 mL water suspension of 5 g titania. After stirring the slurry for 1 h, 1 mol/L of (NH 4)2CO 3 solution was slowly added to keep the pH around 8. The slurry was heated to 70 oC and aged for 1 h. The fresh samples were obtained by filtering the slurry, continuously washing with 70 oC water, then drying in vacuum at room temperature (RT) overnight. The obtained powder catalysts were calcined at 200 oC for 2 h (ramping rate: 2 oC/min) to obtain the 4.8 wt.% Au/TiO 2 (DP) sample. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy confirmed the gold loading as 4.8 wt.%. The as prepared catalysts were stored in dark vacuum before any activity tests and
