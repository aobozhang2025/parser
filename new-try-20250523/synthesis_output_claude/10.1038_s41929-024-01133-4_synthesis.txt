Preparation of TiNS TiNS were synthesized by solid-state calcination of TiO 2 :K 2 CO 3 :LiCO 3 in a mole ratio of 1.0:0.23:0.078 according to previously reported procedures 45 . The mixed powder was finely ground for 30 min and calcined in two steps: heating at 900 °C for 1 h and gentle grinding after natural cooling to room temperature, and heating at 1,000 °C for 20 h and natural cooling to room temperature. In both calcination steps, the temperature rose at 10 °C min − 1 to reach the set point. The obtained layered parent microcrystals were washed three times with hot water to remove unreacted K 2 CO 3 and LiCO 3 . The washed K 0.8 Ti 1.73 Li 0.27 O 4 layered oxide was protonated by soaking in HCl solution (0.5 M) at room temperature for 3 days, and the solution was replaced daily with a fresh batch. To produce TiNS, the protonated titanate crystals (H 1.0 Ti 1.73 O 4 ) were dispersed in an aqueous solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) and then shaken gently for 2 days. The molar ratio between TMAOH and the protonated solid was 1:1, and the solid-to-solution ratio was controlled at 4.0 mg ml − 1 . To avoid the deleterious impact of TMAOH molecules in electrocatalytic applications, TiNS was purified by adding an appropriate amount of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 (0.5 M). Then, the suspension was separated by centrifugation for 30 min at 1,610 g at room temperature. The supernatant containing TMA + NO 3 − was discarded, and TiNS was collected as a precipitate. The precipitate was re-suspended in HCl (1 M) and sonicated for 30 min, to convert residual Mg(OH) 2 into MgCl 2 and remove it with the supernatant after centrifugation (2,862 g ). Finally, TiNS was dispersed in EG by a simple shaking process. Preparation of Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS TiNS loaded with Ru and Pt (denoted as Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS, respectively) were prepared by a modified polyol method. An appropriate amount of RuCl 3 or H 2 PtCl 6 precursor was added to isolated TiNS to reach 25 wt.% Ru or 20 wt.% Pt. Typically, TiNS (200 mg) was first dispersed in EG (50 ml) by shaking. Then, the Ru precursor solution (103.13 mg RuCl 3 · x H 2 O dissolved in 10 ml deionized water, equivalent to 50.25 mg of Ru) was added dropwise to TiNS dispersed in EG. In the case of Pt@TiNS, the Pt precursor solution (107.92 mg H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O dissolved in 10 ml deionized water, equivalent to 40.63 mg of Pt) was added dropwise to 200 mg TiNS dispersed in EG. The end product was heated for 3 h at 190 °C in an N 2 environment. The final step involved centrifuging Ru@TiNS or Pt@TiNS after washing them three times in acetone. For comparison, Ru (or Pt) loaded onto TiO 2 nanoparticles (TiO 2 -NP) was synthesized with the same procedure but replacing TiNS with TiO 2 . Preparation of the catalyst ink and working electrode To study the electrocatalytic performance, a uniform ink dispersion was prepared by sonicating 2.0 mg of the electrocatalyst in 0.95 ml ethanol and 0.05 ml Nafion solution (5 wt.%) for 30 min, followed by stirring for 10 h. The obtained ink was sprayed onto the surface (1.5 cm 2 ) of a clean carbon paper (CP) on a hotplate at 120 °C. The catalyst loading was accurately measured by weighting the CP with a microbalance with and without the electrocatalyst. The catalyst inks were sprayed onto one side of CP at a weight density of 1 mg cm − 2 . Considering that the electrocatalyst contained 25 wt.% of Ru or 20 wt.% of Pt, the Ru or Pt mass density was about 0.25 and 0.2 mg cm − 2 , respectively. Preparation of perovskite-based photocathode ITO/glass substrates were treated with UV/ozone for 30 min and then transferred to a N 2 -filled glovebox with both H 2 O and O 2 levels below 0.1 ppm. A PTAA solution (2 mg ml − 1 in toluene) was spin-cast at 4,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 100 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, a PFN-Br solution (0.5 mg ml − 1 in methanol) was deposited onto the PTAA films. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving caesium iodide (CsI; 0.06 M), formamidinium iodide (FAI; 1 M), methylammonium bromide (MABr; 0.2 M), lead iodide (PbI 2 ; 1.1 M), lead bromide (PbBr 2 ; 0.2 M) and oleylamine (0.1 wt.%) in 1 ml of dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvent (4/1, v/v). The perovskite layer was deposited using a two-step spin-coating procedure at 1,000 rpm for 5 s and then 5,000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 150 µl of chlorobenzene as an antisolvent was quickly dropped on the centre 10 s before the end of the whole spinning process. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The perovskite film was coated with PMMA (1 mg ml − 1 in ethyl acetate) and spun at 5,000 rpm before being heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The electron transporting layer was deposited by spin-casting a PC 61 BM solution (25 mg ml − 1 in chlorobenzene) at 1,000 rpm for 30 s and a BCP solution (1 mg ml − 1 in isopropyl alcohol) at 4,000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 150-nm-thick Ag electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation at <10 − 6 Torr. Ru@TiNS was sprayed on a piece of CP. After drying, the Ru@TiNS loaded on CP was connected to the Ni foil (0.6 cm × 0.6 cm, thickness ~0.1 mm, Alfa Aesar) with the silver (Ag) paste. This configuration was then attached to the Ag layer (top electrode of the perovskite solar cell) using FM, where it was melted at its melting point (62 °C), followed by cooling to room temperature according to a previous report 28 . The edges were then covered with epoxy resin. Finally, to complete the fabrication, small, enamelled piece of copper wire was connected to the samples via Ag paste, leaving them for at least 24 h to dry completely. Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NITRR) All NITRR experiments were performed in a three-electrode H-cell configuration, with constant stirring at 500 rpm in both compartments. CP with sprayed catalyst ink was used as the working electrode; Hg/HgO or Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in alkaline or acidic medium, respectively; and a piece of clean Pt wire as the CE. The applied potential was expressed relative to the RHE using the following equation for conversion: $$E,{V}_{{{\mathrm{RHE}}}}=E,{V}_{\frac{{{\mathrm{Hg}}}}{{{\mathrm{HgO}}}}}\left({{\mathrm{or}}\; E},{V}_{\frac{{{\mathrm{Ag}}}}{{{\mathrm{AgCl}}}}}\right)+0.59\,{{\mathrm{pH}}}.$$ The two compartments in the H-cell were separated by a Nafion membrane. The concentrations of NH 3 and NO 2 − were measured periodically in the anolyte part to check product diffusion from the catholyte to the anolyte cell. When needed, a replenishment system was utilized to supply fresh NO 3 − electrolyte solution in the catholyte compartment. In the experiments, the H-cell was filled with 50 ml electrolyte solution in each half, and the system was connected online to the gas chromatograph to analyse the HER. It was also equipped with a sealed syringe to enable online sampling and measurement of NH 3 and NO 2 − concentrations (using the indophenol blue and Griess reagent protocols, respectively; Supplementary ). The FE for NH 3 and NO 2 − and the current density for NH 3 were calculated as follows: $${{{\mathrm{FE}}}}_{{{\mathrm{NH}}}3}=\frac{\left(8\times F\times {C}_{{{\mathrm{NH}}}3}\times V\,\right)}{Q}$$ $${{{\mathrm{FE}}}}_{{{\mathrm{NO}}}2}=\frac{\left(2\times F\times {C}_{{{\mathrm{NO}}}2}\times V\,\right)}{Q}$$ $${{{\mathrm{FE}}}}_{{\mathrm{H}}2}=\frac{\left(2\times F\times {C}_{{\mathrm{H}}2}\times V\,\right)}{Q}$$ where F is the Faraday constant, V is the volume of the electrolyte, Q is the transferred charge in the electrocatalytic reaction, C NH3 and C NO2 are respectively the molar concentrations of NH 3 and nitrite, m is the catalyst mass and t is the reaction time. Furthermore, the onset potential, which we define here to mean to the voltage at which 0.5 mA cm − 2 is reached. Electrochemical glycerol oxidation In the electrochemical glycerol oxidation experiment, Pt@TiNS sprayed on CP (loading: 1 mg cm − 2 ) was used as the working electrode, Pt wire as the CE, and Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. A two-compartment cell was filled with 50 ml of 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M glycerol as electrolyte on each side. The product concentration and selectivity were measured by a Waters 2535 high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with UV and refractive index detectors and a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H sugar column. PEC measurement PEC measurements were performed on each individual photocathode utilizing a half-cell reactor in 1.0 M KOH with various KNO 3 concentrations in a conventional three-electrode system. The working, reference and counter electrodes were integrated perovskite photocathode, Hg/HgO (1.0 M NaOH), and Pt mesh (1 cm × 1 cm). All potentials were measured against the Hg/HgO reference electrode and converted to the RHE reference scale using the equation E ( V versus RHE) = E ( V versus Hg/HgO) + 0.059 × pH + 0.118. For the unassisted measurement system, PEC tests were performed to reveal the long-term stability and concentration of formed products using 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M KNO 3 (50 ml) as the catholyte and 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M glycerol (50 ml) as the anolyte. The home-made glass reactor was used to conduct the unassisted experiments. A Nafion 117 membrane that had been pre-activated by soaking in deionized water for 2 h divided this two-compartment reactor in the middle. The geometric area of the photocathodes was used to normalize all current densities, and a 10 mV s − 1 scan rate was maintained. The simulated AM 1.5 G one-sun irradiation was achieved by using a water filter and a 300 W xenon lamp. By aligning a silicon reference cell (approved by Newport Corporation; PEC-SI01, Peccell Technologies) parallel to the light beam from the xenon lamp, the light intensity was adjusted on the ITO side (backside illumination) to one sun. The device was covered by black tape except for an aperture area of 0.096 cm 2 , which determined the illumination area. The absorbance measurements were conducted on a UV–Vis spectrometer (Agilent Cary 5000). The thickness of the PMMA layer was measured by first depositing the layer on thin ITO glass and then conducting ellipsometry (Elli-SE-UaM8). Indophenol blue method UV–Vis spectroscopy was utilized to measure NH 3 concentration by the indophenol blue method 29 , 37 , 46 . The samples were collected through the gas-sealed syringe line and diluted enough to be within detectable range. Then, into 1 ml mixed solution containing 1 M NaOH, 5 wt.% salicylic acid and 5 wt.% sodium citrate, 1 ml of diluted sample was added. In the next step, 0.5 ml NaClO (0.05 M) was added and mixed by pipetting method. Finally, 0.1 ml sodium nitroferricyanide solution (1.0 wt.%) was added, mixed and kept for 1 h under dark before UV–Vis spectrophotometry measurement. The peak absorbance at 655 nm was recorded, and the NH 3 concentration was calculated by calibration curve obtained using NH 4 Cl solutions (Supplementary a,b ). The NH 3 concentration was also measured by 1 H-NMR (500 MHz) according to a previous reported procedure 46 . The sample was diluted to the detection range and mixed with 0.1 ml DMSO, and its NMR spectrum was acquired on a Liquid Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer. The NH 3 concentration was evaluated using a standard calibration curve (Supplementary ). Nitrite detection The nitrite concentration was measured using a spectroscopy procedure reported elsewhere 29 . p -Aminobenzenesulfonamide (2.0 g) was dissolved in 50 ml deionized water. Another solution was prepared by mixing ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.1 g) and phosphoric acid (3.94 ml) in 50 ml deionized water. Both solutions were stored in the refrigerator and mixed in 1:1 volume ratio (colouring agent) just before the UV–Vis measurement. Then, 1.0 ml of the collected sample was diluted to reach the detection range, and 2.0 ml H 2 SO 4 (0.5 M) was added and finally 1.0 ml of the above prepared colouring agent. By using UV–Vis spectrophotometry, the intensity of the spectral peak at 540 nm was determined (UV-2600). A calibration curve was used to determine the concentration (Supplementary c,d ). Isotopically labelled ammonia ( 15 NH 3 ) detection To exclude the possibility of NH 3 detection by another source of contaminations (N 2 reduction reaction, electrode contamination or NH 3 injection through gas line or in air) isotopically labelled K 15 NO 3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 atom% 15 N) was utilized as N-source and the corresponding 15 NH 3 + was quantified by 15 NH 3 + (Agilent (Varian) VNMRS-600MHz spectrometer). Due to the clear identification of 15 NH 3 + with doublet 15 NH 3 + from triplet peaks of 14 NH 3 + , overestimation of NH 3 concentration and consequently FE, percentage can be cancelled effectively. Isotopically labelled experiments were conducted for both electrocatalytic and PEC conversion of K 15 NO 3 to 15 NH 4 + . The sample was taken from electrolyte at different time after starting reaction and then acidified to pH 3 by adding appropriate 3 M HCl. The sample then mixed with 0.1 ml DMSO, and its 1 H-NMR spectrum was obtained. The 15 NH 4 + concentration was quantified based on the calibration curve acquired by a set of 15 NH 4 Cl (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 atom% 15 N) standard solutions (Supplementary ). Anolyte product quantification A certain amount of aliquot was analysed after each experiment using HPLC to calculate selectivity of the products via an Agilent 1260 infinity 2 chromatography equipped with a Hi-Plex H (7.7 × 300 mm, 8 μm) column. The selectivity of products was calculated by the following equation: $${{\mathrm{Selectivity}}}=\frac{{N}_{{\mathrm{D}}}}{{N}_{{\mathrm{T}}}}\times 100$$ $${\rm{Yield}}, \% =\frac{{N}_{{\mathrm{D}}}}{{a\times N}_{{\mathrm{i}}}}\times 100$$ where N T is the total sum of desired and undesired products, N i is the initial concentration of glycerol and N D is the desired product. For its quantification, the standard calibration curve was plotted on the basis of the concentration and integrated area in HPLC. Here the solvent for standard solution was H 2 SO 4 with proper concentration recommended for column.
