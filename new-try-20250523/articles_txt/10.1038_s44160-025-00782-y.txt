Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation represents an effective means of hydrocarbon valorization, but achieving high-selectivity intermediate products at high substrate conversion remains challenging. Here single-atom Pd–O catalytic sites with different coordination environments are synthesized. The Pd–O
3
coordinated single sites show the best catalytic performance for selective toluene oxidation, exhibiting a high benzaldehyde selectivity of 95% at 95% toluene conversion, and a benzaldehyde yield rate up to 12,000 μmol g
−1
h
−1
, surpassing previously reported results. The Pd–O
3
catalytic sites serve as the location of photogenerated charge separation and C(
sp
3
)–H bond activation. These sites can trap the photogenerated holes effectively to enhance the charge-separation efficiency, improving the yield rate by a factor of 2.9 relative to the Bi

support. Additionally, the coordination structure weakens benzaldehyde adsorption, reducing overoxidation and improving reaction selectivity. This work highlights the importance of single-atom site coordination in optimizing the activity and selectivity of photocatalytic oxidation reactions.

Main
The selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to produce high-value-added chemicals, for example, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and epoxides, is an essential process for catalysis and chemical production
1
,
2
. Despite decades of development, thermal catalytic C(
sp
3
)–H bond activation still requires elevated temperatures, high pressures and strong oxidants, resulting in appreciable energy consumption and associated environmental impacts. Moreover, the harsh reaction conditions lead to substrate overoxidation, generating unwanted side products
3
,
4
. The conventional approach is to restrict substrate conversion to achieve high selectivity of the intermediate products, which increases the cost of the requisite separation steps
5
,
6
. Consequently, selective photocatalytic hydrocarbon oxidation utilizing oxygen has been identified as a high-priority chemical process
7
. In recent years, researchers have reported diverse effective photocatalysts, notably oxide semiconductors with a wide bandgap (for example, TiO
2
, Bi
2
WO
6
, BiOBr)
8
,
9
,
10
, and have enhanced the activity of these catalysts through facet regulation
11
,
12
, surface defect engineering
10
and the design of composites
8
,
13
,
14
. Nevertheless, current photocatalysts still face the same activity–selectivity trade-off
15
,
16
,
17
. The photogenerated holes exhibit excessive oxidation activity, and the intermediate oxidation products (especially valuable aldehydes) are readily oxidized, resulting in poor selectivity. Therefore, most reported photocatalysts with high benzaldehyde selectivity are achieved at low toluene conversion (<10%)
18
,
19
,
20
. This indicates that enhanced selectivity for an intermediate oxidation product at high substrate conversion is still a pressing challenge in the field of advanced photocatalysis.
Single-atom photocatalysts have become an emerging research area in recent years. For example, Pd

/TiO
2
, Pd

O

and rare-earth Y

/TiO

catalysts show enhanced activity in photocatalytic C–H bond activation
21
,
22
,
23
. Embedding single-atom sites on photocatalytic supports can modify the surface band structure, where the single-atom and surrounding atoms serve as crucial sites for separating photogenerated carriers, improving charge-separation efficiency. After trapping the photogenerated carriers, the activated single-atom catalytic sites become the key location for selective adsorption and activation of reactant molecules
24
,
25
,
26
. A rational design and construction of single-atom catalytic sites with different chemical environments (including regulating coordination atoms, adjacent vacancy atoms, electronic structures and geometric configurations) may optimize the adsorption–desorption response, reactant activation and separation of photogenerated carriers. The advantages associated with single-atom photocatalysts along with the potential for regulating their coordination environment offers scope to boost both activity and selectivity.
In this study, we have synthesized two single-atom Pd–O catalytic sites on Bi
2
WO
6
(Pd–O
3
/BWO and Pd–O
4
/BWO, where BWO is a generated support (Supplementary Fig.
1
)) to regulate the adsorption–desorption behaviour of products. When applied to the visible-light-driven oxidation of toluene at room temperature, Pd–O
3
/BWO delivered a boosted benzaldehyde yield rate of 11,927 μmol g
−1
h
−1
(2.9 times that of BWO and 2.3 times that of Pd–O
4
/BWO), achieving 95% benzaldehyde selectivity at 95% toluene conversion (Supplementary Table
1
); the selectivity obtained with BWO and Pd–O
4
/BWO was only 55% and 63%, respectively. Additionally, continuous-flow benzaldehyde production was achieved with a space–time yield of 5.1 kg m
−
3
h
−1
while maintaining high selectivity (92% at 94% conversion), demonstrating the potential for large-scale application. Mechanistic analysis, spectroscopic experiments and theoretical calculations establish the basis for the difference in the catalytic performance of Pd–O
3
/BWO and Pd–O
4
/BWO. The single-atom Pd–O
3
catalytic sites can capture photogenerated holes more effectively and ensure a substantial charge-separation efficiency, improving toluene reactivity. In addition, the unique coordination structure of Pd–O
3
achieves an optimal adsorption energy with respect to the intermediate oxidation product (benzaldehyde), preventing further oxidation and facilitating a concomitant enhanced reaction activity and selectivity.

Photocatalytic Bi

/amorphous BiOCl nanosheets previously reported by our group
13
. A series of palladium-based Bi
2
WO
6
photocatalysts were prepared using a facile three-step method (Fig.
1a
). The surface of Bi
2
WO
6
can expose coordinatively unsaturated –Bi/–O atoms after the removal of the amorphous BiOCl component by nitric acid and subsequent hydrogen treatment (to produce the BWO support (Supplementary Fig.
1
)). Subsequently, palladium was dispersed on the BWO surface in single-atom form by impregnation, and the coordination environment was regulated by controlling the calcination temperature in air. The as-prepared photocatalysts are denoted as Pd–O

/BWO and Pd–O

/BWO in accordance with the Pd–O coordination number (Fig.

The photocatalysts exhibited a nanosheet morphology with numerous small nanoplate units, consistent with the BWO substrate (Supplementary Fig.
2
). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) excludes the existence of metallic palladium and PdO

on Pd–O
4
/BWO and Pd–O
3
/BWO (Supplementary Fig.
3
). Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) showed some brighter atoms encircled in yellow, representing atomically dispersed palladium atoms that may overlap with the underlying metal atoms of the support, resulting in enhanced brightness at this site when viewed from the [010] direction (Fig.
1b,c
). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping demonstrated that the palladium component was uniformly distributed on the BWO surface, in contrast to the palladium aggregation observed in the case of Pd
NP
/BWO (Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Figs.
4
and
5
)
The palladium dispersion was also evaluated by CO adsorption using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis (Fig.
1e
). BWO exhibits a CO adsorption peak at 1,897 cm
−1
. The broad adsorption peak at 1,904 cm
−1
for Pd
NP
/BWO corresponds to the bridge-type CO adsorption on palladium nanoparticles. In the case of Pd–O
4
/BWO and Pd–O
3
/BWO, the intensity of the peak at 1,897 cm
−1
matched that of the support, and there were no detectable CO adsorption peaks relative to uptake on palladium nanoparticles
27
. The CO adsorption peaks appeared at 2,075 cm
−1
for Pd–O
4
/BWO and 2,042 cm
−1
for Pd–O
3
/BWO, representing a linear-type CO adsorption on palladium single-atom sites with different valence states, confirming that the single palladium atoms in both catalysts were isolated on the support
28
. The peak at 2,075 cm
−1
is less intense, suggesting a weaker CO adsorption on highly coordinated palladium
29
. High-resolution Pd 3
d
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Supplementary Fig.

) of the series samples showed different binding energies, demonstrating different chemical environments for the palladium single-atom sites in Pd–O
4
/BWO and Pd–O
3
/BWO.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate the oxidation state and coordination environment of single atoms of palladium in the samples. Pd K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra are shown in Fig.
1f
. The absorption edges for Pd–O
4
/BWO and Pd–O
3
/BWO fall between the palladium foil and PdO references, suggesting a palladium oxidation number between 0 and +2. The white-line intensity of Pd–O
4
is slightly lower than that of PdO, while the intensity of Pd–O
3
is weaker. This suggests that the oxidation state and coordination environment of Pd–O in Pd–O
4
/BWO are similar to those of palladium in PdO, whereas the oxidation number of Pd–O in Pd–O
3
/BWO is lower than that of PdO, and the coordination environment differs significantly
30
,
31
.
Fourier transforms of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the Pd K-edge (Fig.
1g
) revealed that Pd–O
4
/BWO and Pd–O
3
/BWO exhibit a predominant peak at approximately 1.5 Å, close to the Pd–O coordination peak of PdO, which can be attributed to the first shell of the Pd–O bond. Moreover, no Pd–O–Pd or Pd–Pd coordination peaks were detected at 3.1 Å and 2.5 Å, indicating that the palladium atoms in Pd–O
4
/BWO and Pd–O
3
/BWO were atomically dispersed with no metallic palladium or PdO clusters. The coordination peak for Pd–O
3
/BWO at 2.6 Å is similar to the Pd–Bi bond length reported in the literature
32
, where the fitted Pd–Bi coordination number is 0.9. The EXAFS fitting results suggest that the palladium single-atom site in Pd–O
4
/BWO is close to a Pd–O
4
coordination, whereas the palladium in Pd–O
3
/BWO is close to a Pd–O
3
coordination and is also coordinated with a nearby bismuth atom from the support (Supplementary Fig.
7
and Supplementary Table
3
).
The unusual Pd–Bi coordination in Pd–O
3
/BWO may be due to the presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the treated BWO support (Supplementary Fig.
1
), which enables the coordination of unsaturated bismuth atoms with palladium. In the synthesis of Pd–O
4
/BWO, the higher calcination temperatures can lead to higher palladium oxidation states, hampering the coordination of palladium and bismuth atoms. Our characterization results have therefore demonstrated the successful synthesis of two palladium single-atom photocatalysts with different coordination environments.
Photocatalytic performance for toluene oxidation
The visible-light-driven selective oxidation of toluene was performed using the characterized photocatalysts. The reaction was conducted at 25 °C with acetonitrile as the solvent and a 405-nm light-emitting diode (LED) as the light source (
∼
130 mW cm
−
2
). The products were detected and quantitatively analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and GC (Supplementary Figs.
8
and
9
). The BWO exhibited a high intrinsic activity, achieving a benzaldehyde yield rate of 4,150 μmol g
−1
h
−1
in a single-batch system with 0.5 mmol toluene as substrate. The activity of BWO was increased after palladium loading. Specifically, Pd–O
3
/BWO delivered a benzaldehyde yield rate of 11,927 μmol g
−1
h
−1
, that is, 2.9 times higher than BWO. In contrast, the rates recorded for Pd–O
4
/BWO and Pd
Np
/BWO exhibited increases by factors of 1.3 and 1.7, respectively (Fig.
2a
). Notably, the turnover frequency (TOF
Pd
) of Pd–O
3
/BWO (1,421 h
−1
) was 5.9 times that of Pd–O
4
/BWO and 22.9 times that of Pd
Np
/BWO. A similar activity response was recorded in a single-batch system with 0.1 mmol toluene (Supplementary Figs.
10
and
11
). In addition, Pd–O
3
/BWO exhibited enhanced benzaldehyde selectivity. In a single-batch reaction system with 0.1 mmol toluene as the substrate, benzaldehyde selectivity reached 95% at 95% toluene conversion after 200 min with a small amount of benzoic acid forming as a by-product. However, BWO, Pd–O
4
/BWO and Pd
Np
/BWO only achieved high benzaldehyde selectivity at low toluene conversion, like other related photocatalysts reported to date

. Once the toluene conversion exceeded 60% (40% for Pd

).

The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) values of the series samples were measured under 405-nm light irradiation; the AQE of Pd–O
3
/BWO was determined to be 11.42% (Supplementary Fig.
12
). The AQE values of Pd–O
3
/BWO under different wavelengths of light were also measured. As shown in Fig.
2c
, the AQE at 365 nm was 28.3%. Due to decreased light absorption at higher wavelengths, the AQE values showed a declining trend. These results are in accordance with ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) analysis.
We tested the stability of Pd–O
3
/BWO in the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene. After five cycles, the catalytic activity showed a mild degree of degradation although the selectivity toward benzaldehyde remained high (Supplementary Fig.
13
). The recycled catalyst was characterized by aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM, EDS, XRD and XPS (Supplementary Figs.
14
–
17
), confirming the presence of atomically dispersed palladium single atoms and no visible structural or compositional changes of the recycled catalysts. The effect of light intensity on the reaction over Pd–O
3
/BWO was also investigated (Supplementary Fig.
18
). The results show that the reaction kinetics is light intensity dependent, and the selectivity of benzaldehyde can be well maintained at a high light intensity of 213 mW cm
−
2
. Additionally, Pd–O
3
/BWO exhibited a broad substrate scope, delivering high activity and selectivity in the conversion of toluene reactants with electron-withdrawing (–Cl and –Br) substituents, when the substrate approached near-complete conversion (Supplementary Fig.
19
). When compared with previously reported work

/BWO exhibited improved toluene oxidation activity and benzaldehyde selectivity under similar reaction conditions (Supplementary Fig.

and Supplementary Table

).
Single-batch scale-up experiments with Pd–O
3
/BWO were conducted. Catalytic activity and selectivity were maintained with threefold (0.3 mmol toluene, 15 mg catalyst, 2 ml acetonitrile) and tenfold (1 mmol toluene, 50 mg catalyst, 2 ml acetonitrile) increases in photocatalyst and substrate. The average yield rate was 5,700 μmol g
−1
h
−1
, and benzaldehyde selectivity exceeded 92% at close to complete conversion (Fig.
2d
). We used a photochemical flow reaction device for the scale-up experiments, with a 405-nm LED panel as the light source (
∼
120 mW cm
−2
) and standard compressed air as oxidant (Fig.
2e
), to further explore the potential for industrial application. The mixed toluene/acetonitrile solution and the dissolved photocatalyst, along with compressed air, were pumped into the flow reactor. The vortex generated within the microstructure channel (Fig.
2e
, inset) can facilitate gas–liquid mixing, prevent catalyst clogging and promote the dissolution of oxygen molecules (Supplementary Fig.
21
). The reactor design also increased the effective illumination area of the photocatalyst. An increase in the amount of photocatalyst and substrate by a factor of 7.5 (37.5 mg catalyst, 0.75 mmol toluene, 15 ml acetonitrile) resulted in 94% toluene conversion with 92% benzaldehyde selectivity after 90 min (Fig.
2f
). The enhanced mass transfer and oxygen dissolution resulted in an appreciable increase in the average yield rate recorded in the flow reaction scale-up experiment, which reached 12,533 μmol g
−1
h
−1
, that is, 2.2 times greater than the single-batch scale-up experiment. Operating the flow reactor with a liquid holding volume of 9 ml, the benzaldehyde space–time yield reached 5.1 kg m
−
3
h
−1
(ref.
37
). The BWO catalyst delivered poor selectivity (Supplementary Fig.
22
), consistent with the single-batch reaction system. These results established that the photochemical flow reactor can deliver an improved benzaldehyde yield rate, and ensure high selectivity to benzaldehyde at high toluene conversion, and therefore is viable for practical applications

Reaction mechanisms and carrier dynamics study

presents the results of control experiments, which consider the roles of light, oxygen, charge carriers and generated radicals. No products were detected under dark conditions, indicating that light plays an essential role. Oxygen in the reaction was crucial (Fig.

3
/BWO only produced trace benzaldehyde in argon. The addition of K

consumed the photogenerated electrons and produced bibenzyl, generated by the coupling of benzyl radicals. The photocatalytic activity slightly decreased when K

isotope experiments showed that the oxygen component in the main product (benzaldehyde) and by-product (benzoic acid) was mainly derived from gaseous oxygen, with only a small portion resulting from the lattice oxygen (Supplementary Fig.
23
), indicating the requirement of external oxygen. The introduction of 2,2′,6,6′-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) as a radical scavenger resulted in a sharp decline in catalytic performance, indicating a free-radical reaction mechanism (Fig.
3a
, entry 7). Triethanolamine (TEOA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and
p

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were conducted using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline
N
-oxide (DMPO) as a free-radical capture reagent to monitor free-radical generation during the reaction. No signals were observed under dark conditions. However, following a 4-min irradiation, each photocatalyst exhibited clear paramagnetic signals, the strengths of which were consistent with photocatalytic performance (Fig.
3b
). The spectra were simulated to identify the free radicals. The experimental spectrum can be satisfactorily interpreted (Supplementary Figs.

. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) values for the four photocatalysts fell between 2 and 8, following first-order reaction kinetics, revealing that C–H bond cleavage was the rate-determining step (Fig.

and Supplementary Fig.
26
)
39
. Taking an overview of the results, Pd–O
3
/BWO exhibited the lowest KIE value (2.11) and the highest kinetic constant
k
H
(2.15 × 10
−3
), representing superior C–H bond activation. The apparent activation energies (
E
a
) of the series samples were calculated based on the Arrhenius equation by controlling the reaction temperature from 15 to 45 °C (Fig.
3d
and Supplementary Fig.
27
)
40
. The photon efficiency was further calculated (Supplementary Table
6
)
41
. Pd–O
3
/BWO shows the lowest
E
a
(29.4 kJ mol
−1
) and the highest photon efficiency (1.14%), which contribute to its superior catalytic performance.
UV–vis DRS and UV photoelectron spectroscopy analyses (Supplementary Fig.
28
) showed an unchanged bandgap (2.71 eV) but enhanced visible-light absorption after palladium loading, suggesting a new light-absorption mechanism. Photocurrent measurements (Supplementary Fig.
29a
) showed Pd–O
3
/BWO to have the largest photocurrent, confirming the highest charge-separation efficiency; these results were supported by the reduced fluorescence and longer photogenerated electron lifetimes observed (Supplementary Fig.
29b,c
and Supplementary Table
7
). Transient photovoltage spectroscopy also confirmed the role of palladium species in facilitating charge separation, with Pd–O
3
/BWO showing a slower charge recombination rate (attenuation constant
τ
= 0.08 ms) than Pd–O
4
/BWO (
τ
= 0.03 ms) (Supplementary Fig.
29d
)
42
.
The possible photogenerated charge pathways were investigated by testing the change in palladium valence state under in situ irradiation by XPS (Fig.
3e
and Supplementary Fig.
30
). In contrast to Pd
Np
/BWO, the Pd 3
d
XPS peak for Pd–O
3
/BWO (using 0.1 wt% palladium to obtain a better signal) was shifted to a higher binding energy, accompanied by the shift of the Bi 4
f
peak toward a lower binding energy under light irradiation (Supplementary Fig.
31
), indicating a migration of photogenerated holes generated from the BWO support to the palladium single-atom site. These findings demonstrate that palladium single-atom sites have a large impact on the migration paths of the photogenerated carriers.
Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was performed to investigate the photogenerated charge-carrier dynamics between palladium single-atom sites and the support. The resultant spectral characteristics are ascribed to Bi
2
WO
6
. The negative peak in the 450–520-nm range is mainly attributed to a ground state bleaching associated with excited state relaxation (Supplementary Fig.

)

. The excited state dynamics of the photocatalysts were analysed by fitting the attenuation spectra of the transient absorption signals at 480 nm with a double-exponential model, and two characteristic constants (
τ
1
and
τ
2
) were obtained (Fig.
3f
). The fast
τ
1
decay time constant reflects the trapping of photogenerated holes by BWO or palladium single-atom sites (Pd–O
3
/BWO and Pd–O
4
/BWO) where the value for the three samples was approximately 10 ps. The slow
τ
2
decay time constant represents the recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons, reflecting the lifetime of photogenerated holes
45
,
46
. The value of
τ
2
for Pd–O
3
/BWO was 0.4 ns, 110% and 100% greater than the values for BWO (0.18 ns) and Pd–O
4
/BWO (0.2 ns), respectively. The results indicate that the Pd–O
3
single-atom sites facilitate hole trapping, delaying recombination with photogenerated electrons and promoting C–H bond activation to a greater extent, resulting in improved photocatalytic activity.
Surface reaction process study
In situ DRIFTS measurements were conducted to identify the surface species formed during the reaction, which may help clarify the source of the high selectivity (Supplementary Fig.
33
). Considering the spectra presented in Fig.
4a–c
, the peaks for toluene showed a gradual increase with the introduction of toluene vapour. Following nitrogen purging, Pd–O
3
/BWO exhibited the strongest toluene adsorption peak, demonstrating a greater toluene adsorption capacity. After oxygen was introduced and light irradiation was applied, the characteristic toluene peaks gradually weakened, particularly in the case of Pd–O
3
/BWO, which exhibited strong inverted peaks at 2,943 cm
−1
and 2,881 cm
−1
(methyl C(
sp
3
)–H stretching vibration), demonstrating a rapid toluene consumption. New peaks ascribed to benzaldehyde appeared and gradually increased in intensity at
∼
1,700 cm
−1
(benzaldehyde C=O), 1,384 cm

(C–H bending vibration in the aldehyde plane) and 1,200 cm

(aromatic ring and aldehyde group C–C stretching)

The adsorption wavenumbers associated with benzaldehyde on the surface of these photocatalysts differed. The wavenumber of the C=O bond is blueshifted from 1,697 cm
−1
to 1,715 cm
−1
with the increase of benzaldehyde production on Pd–O
3
/BWO, which indicates a weak benzaldehyde interaction and suggests a facile desorption from the surface (Supplementary Fig.
34
). In contrast, the wavenumber of the C=O bond on the BWO and Pd–O
4
/BWO catalysts appeared below 1,700 cm
−1
, with no large shift observed. Furthermore, with BWO and Pd–O
4
/BWO, the characteristic spectral band of benzoic acid at 920 cm
−1
(carboxyl group O–H out-of-plane bending vibration) appeared
51
, and increased in intensity with prolonged reaction time. The strength of benzaldehyde adsorption was also verified by microcalorimetric measurements. The differential heat of benzaldehyde adsorption on Pd–O
3
/BWO was 248.6 J g
−1
, which is the lowest heat produced among the samples, demonstrating that this catalyst has lowest benzaldehyde adsorption strength (Fig.
4d
)
52
.
The benzaldehyde adsorption energy of the different catalysts was also examined by DFT calculation. In the optimized structural model (Supplementary Figs.
35
and
36
), Pd–O
3
/BWO exhibited the lowest adsorption energy (−0.44 eV, Supplementary Fig.
37
). Calculation of the work functions showed similar surface electrostatic potentials of the samples (Supplementary Fig.
38
), excluding the influence of electrostatic potential on the adsorption behaviour of palladium sites. Density of states calculation showed the highest antibonding orbital energy for Pd–O
3
, which corresponds to the weakest benzaldehyde adsorption (Supplementary Fig.
39
). The above results revealed that the Pd–O
3
single-atom sites resulted in weaker benzaldehyde adsorption, contributing to enhanced photocatalytic selectivity.
The potential energy diagram for the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde was calculated to elucidate the energy changes in the reaction system (Fig.
4e
and Supplementary Figs.
40
–
42
). According to previous literature
53
,
54
, the overall reaction involves the following processes: coadsorption of toluene and oxygen; combination of dissociated hydrogen with benzylic C–H bond breakage and O

and *OOH intermediates; *C

OOH decomposition to benzaldehyde; desorption of benzaldehyde from the photocatalyst surface. The Pd–O
3
/BWO catalyst exhibited the lowest Gibbs free-energy barrier (0.29 eV) of the catalyst series over the entire reaction process. The palladium single-atom sites on BWO promote the adsorption of substrate molecules to different degrees, where the effect of the Pd–O
3
catalytic sites exceeds that of the Pd–O
4
counterpart, leading to an enhanced toluene and oxygen adsorption capacity and resulting in higher activity. Furthermore, the distance between the adsorbed *C

2
and *OOH (3.29 Å) on the Pd–O
3
structure is shorter than that (4.61 Å) associated with the Pd–O
4
counterpart, which favoured coupling to form *C
6
H
5
CH
2
OOH in Pd–O
3
/BWO, ultimately leading to increased benzaldehyde production. In addition, Pd–O
3
/BWO exhibited the weakest adsorption on benzaldehyde, and the presence of an energy barrier to deep oxidation enhanced the probability of desorption (Supplementary Fig.
43
). These energy calculations are in line with Pd–O
3
/BWO having the highest experimentally observed selectivity in this series of catalysts.
Based on the above experimental and theoretical results, we propose a structure–activity relationship for the series samples (Fig.
5
). In the palladium single-atom photocatalysts, the photogenerated holes can be effectively transferred to the Pd–O site. The palladium component serves as the toluene adsorption site, facilitating activation of the C(
sp
3
)–H bond and enhancing overall catalytic performance. In the case of Pd
NP
/BWO, the photogenerated electrons migrate to the palladium nanoparticles due to the Schottky barrier, resulting in toluene activation by photogenerated holes at the interface between the palladium nanoparticles and support, which greatly reduces the utilization of palladium atoms. In addition, the strong interaction of the intermediate oxidation product (benzaldehyde) with palladium nanoparticles and Pd–O
4
sites promotes deep oxidation with consequent lower selectivity. Conversely, the single-atom Pd–O
3
sites associated with Pd–O
3
/BWO effectively regulate the catalyst surface, which has a better toluene adsorption capacity with weaker benzaldehyde interaction and improved charge separation, which ensures more effective utilization of photogenerated holes in activating benzylic C–H bond dissociation, leading to an enhanced selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde.

Conclusions
We have investigated the influence of single-atom coordination environments (Pd–O) on photogenerated carrier separation, C–H bond activation and the adsorption–desorption response of intermediate products in the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene. The palladium single-atom sites on the surface of Bi
2
WO
6
can trap photogenerated holes and serve as the toluene adsorption site, representing a catalytic active site that reduces the activation energy barrier of the benzylic C(
sp
3
)–H bond, enhancing the overall catalytic performance. Regulating the Pd–O coordination structure can optimize the desorption of intermediate oxidation products from the single-atom sites, which increases reaction selectivity. In the case of Pd–O
3
/BWO, the intermediate benzaldehyde product readily desorbs from the palladium single-atom sites, circumventing further oxidation and enhancing the production of benzaldehyde. Stronger benzaldehyde interaction with other samples leads to overoxidation. This work highlights the effect of active site coordination structure on catalytic reactivity, offering important insights that can inform the design of single-atom photocatalysts to achieve enhanced reactivity and optimum selectivity.

Finally, the solid was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C overnight, after which the supernatant was almost transparent, indicating the successful loading of palladium nanoparticles on the support.
Catalytic evaluation
Single-batch reaction system
Typically, 5 mg photocatalysts and 0.1 mmol toluene were dispersed in 2 ml acetonitrile and transferred into a 10-ml quartz tube with continuous stirring. Then, O
2
was steadily bubbled through the solution. The photocatalytic reactions were performed on a WATTCAS Parallel Light Reactor (WP-TEC-1020HSL), using an 8-W, 400–405-nm purple LED, which was integrated with a water circulation system that maintained the temperature constant at 25 °C (room temperature). The light power density was measured through direct contact with the light source by an optical power and energy meter (Thorlabs-PM 100D) as 130 mW cm
−
2
. After irradiation for a specified time, the mixture was collected and the photocatalysts were separated by centrifugation. The obtained supernatant was detected and quantitatively analysed by GC–MS with an electron capture detector (Thermo Trace GC Ultra) and GC with a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC 2010 Plus).
Flow reaction system
Generally, 37.5 mg photocatalysts and 0.75 mmol toluene were thoroughly dispersed in 15 ml acetonitrile by sonication. Then, the mixture was transferred to a vessel with continuous stirring and water cooling to guarantee a constant room temperature (25 °C). Subsequently, the mixture was pumped into the photochemical flow reaction reactor (9 ml liquid hold-up volume) via a peristaltic pump. Meanwhile, the compressed air was introduced and controlled by a flow meter to form monodispersed bubbles in the reactor channels. After the specified reaction time, the mixture was collected and centrifuged, and the contents finally detected and analysed.
The flow reaction device is fitted with a 405-nm LED panel as the light source. This panel was clamped to the device and its light power density was measured through direct contact with the light source by an optical power and energy meter (Thorlabs-PM 100D) as 120 mW cm
−

. The product detection and quantitative analysis were performed in the same way as for the single-batch system.

In situ DRIFTS
In situ DRIFTS was performed on an INVENIO-R spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. The catalyst was put into a ceramic cell and placed in the detection chamber. After pretreatment in a nitrogen atmosphere at 100 °C for 30 min, the catalyst was cooled to room temperature to record the background spectrum. Subsequently, toluene was introduced into the chamber by nitrogen bubbling for 30 min. Then, the physisorbed toluene was removed by nitrogen flow (the signal remained almost unchanged after 14 min). Oxygen was introduced, and simultaneously a 405-nm light source was turned on. To acquire the analytical spectra, 128 scans were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm
