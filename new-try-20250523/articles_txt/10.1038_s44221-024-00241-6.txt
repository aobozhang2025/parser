Abstract
Reactive oxygen species enable efficient oxidative removal or detoxification of pollutants in water but traditional approaches for reactive oxygen species generation are chemically demanding, which limits their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate a sustainable and chemical-free superoxide (O
2
•−
) generation strategy by integrating rechargeable carbonaceous supercapacitors with redox-moiety-based O
2
activation, which is distinct from production using traditional electrocatalysis. Highly porous carbonaceous geosupercapacitors were developed by pyrolysing cattle bones consisting of macromolecules interlinked with abundant minerals, followed by acid etching. Porous geosupercapacitors exhibit high capacitances and excellent electron-transfer efficiencies for O
2
activation as a result of their abundant carbon defects and redox-active quinone moieties, thereby effectively transferring electrons to O
2
to form O
2
•−
radicals. Electrochemical analysis shows that the electron-transfer rate of the carbonaceous geosupercapacitor is orders of magnitude higher than that of traditional biochar, notably promoting electron transfer and O
2
activation. This geosupercapacitor possesses excellent electron rechargeability and a stable capacitance, enabling sustainable O
2
•−
production off-line. The utility of this green O
2
•−
producing system is confirmed in different scenarios, such as stable performance in complex matrices, treating diverse redox-active pollutants and development of a portable chargeable device.

Main
Chemical oxidative transformation of organic pollutants and heavy metals (for example, As(III)) by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a well-recognized strategy for environmental remediation
1
but traditional approaches for ROS production, such as Fenton or Fenton-like reactions, face limitations including the need for large amounts of chemical (for example, H
2
O
2
and Fe(II)) inputs and the excessive production of iron sludge
2
, which thus hinders their practical applications
3
. Alternatively, direct activation of oxygen (O
2
) to generate superoxide (O
2
•−
) radicals is receiving ever-increasing attention
4
because of its green nature and because O
2
can be directly acquired from the atmosphere and thus avoids the transportation of chemicals. Although the rate constants of O
2
•−
radicals reaction with various organic pollutants are found to be relatively lower than other potent ROS, such as hydroxyl radical (•OH) (ref.
5
), extensive research has shown its effectiveness in pollutant oxidation
6
. As a result, it has become one of the attractive technologies in water treatments
7
, particularly exhibiting great potential for developing portable devices for decentralized water treatments in rural areas. Several O
2
activators (that is, electron donors), such as Fe(II) and carbonaceous materials, have been explored
8
; among these, biomass-derived carbonaceous materials, such as biochar, possessing redox-active moieties (for example, phenolic-OH and semiquinone), are ideal candidates for O
2
•−
generation because chemical additives are not needed during their production process
9
,
10
.
Generation of O
2
•−
radicals by the activators involves a one-electron-transfer (ET) process towards O
2
and its production efficiency is highly dependent on both the electron capacity and ET efficiency of the carbonaceous materials which is influenced by the pyrolysis process of biomass precursors
11
. The macromolecules in biomass (for example, lignin and cellulose) can be cleaved or polymerized at different locations under O
2
-free/limited conditions at elevated temperatures and subsequently, phenolic-OH and semiquinone moieties are formed on graphite-like sheets in an electron-rich state
12
. Evidence suggests that these moieties
13
probably act as the reaction sites for O
2
activation and can form at a temperature range of 300–500 °C (refs.
14
,
15
). However, pyrolysis at low temperature leads to poor conductivity of the carbonaceous matrix and thus limits the proposed ET process and therefore O
2
activation
16
. The lack of a suitable porous structure and specific surface area (SSA) for these carbonaceous materials is another obstacle limiting their electron capacities. Additionally, there is also little development in the reusability of carbonaceous materials (for example, biochar) in O
2
activation because of the challenge of electron recharging and storage, which has become a major obstacle for sustainable O
2
•−
production towards green remediation.
Carbonaceous supercapacitors which can constantly perform several charging/discharging cycles, have been well documented in the field of energy storage
17
,
18
. Strategies for preparing carbonaceous supercapacitors have been established by using sol–gel processes (bottom-up) or directly using biomass (top-down) in pyrolysis, which favours electron preservation in the electrochemical double layer
19
. Such conceptual frameworks offer ideal platforms for developing supercapacitor-like O
2
activators for sustainable O
2
•−
production. Furthermore, animal skeletons (for example, cattle bones) consist of abundant minerals (for example, Ca
3
(PO
4
)
2
) (as the template) intertwined with macromolecules
8
,
20
making them ideal precursors for the top-down preparation of highly porous carbonaceous supercapacitors.
In this work, we report a chemical-free and green O
2
•−
generation strategy with a rechargeable porous carbonaceous material (denoted hereafter as carbonaceous geosupercapacitors (CGs)), directly through O
2
activation in water (Fig.
1a
). This CG material was directly prepared by simply pyrolysing cattle bones under O
2
-free conditions at high temperatures followed by acid etching. Arsenite (As(III)), a widespread toxic metalloid in waters and aquifers
21
, was chosen as a representative pollutant and additional pollutants, including dyes (rhodamine B dye (RB), methyl orange (MO), methylene blue (MB)), tetracycline (TC), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and Cr(VI), were used to verify the broad applicability of this technology. The reusability of developed CG for sustainable pollutant oxidation was further determined through electron recharging/refilling. The possibility of extending this O
2
•−
producing system to obtain other potent ROS such as •OH radicals was also determined by a simple combination with iron oxides. A CG-embedded portable continuous-flow device was fabricated to demonstrate the potential value of this proposed system for water treatment.

Characterization of CGs
Cattle-bone-derived CGs (that is, CG
x
, where
x
represents pyrolysis temperature) were successfully synthesized. Scanning electron microscopy images show that the CG750–1,050 samples exhibit a highly porous structure after acid etching (Supplementary Fig.
1
) and these intertwined mineral particles can be assigned to Ca
5
(PO
4
)OH (PDF no. 09-0432) on the basis of our X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
2
). Two broad peaks at 20°–30° and 43° corresponding to the (002) and (100) facets of crystalline carbon, respectively, were observed for CG750–1,050 (Fig.
1b
), of which the XRD intensity gradually increases with increasing pyrolysis temperature, indicating the formation of a highly graphitic structure
18
,
22
. Acid etching leads to substantially enhanced SSAs for CGs and the highest value of 1,002.6 m
2
g
−1
is obtained for CG950 (Fig.
1c
, Supplementary Fig.
3
and Supplementary Table
1
), which is higher than those for plant-derived biochar (for example, 0.8–285 m
2
g
−1
) as previously reported
12
, thereby providing potential reaction sites for O
2
adsorption and activation
23
. CG950 also has a large pore volume of 2.75 cm
3
g
−1
and large pore sizes up to 80 nm (Fig.
1c
), indicating the abundance of macroporous and mesoporous structures in its carbon matrix.
The Raman spectra of the CGs show two peaks centred at 1,340 and 1,590 cm
−1
assigned to the D-band (disordered carbon) and G-band (graphitized carbon), respectively (Fig.
1d
). According to the ratio of the D-band to G-band (
I
D
/
I
G
) representing the defect degree in CGs
24
, calculations indicate that the
I
D
/
I
G
value of CGs increases with increasing pyrolysis temperature and reaches 1.20 at 950 °C (that is, CG950). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of the CG reflect their spin dynamics in a graphite-like structure; a classic Lorentizian shape (
g
= 2; the
g
-factor is a unitless measurement of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron) with a considerably stronger signal intensity is revealed for CG950 compared to that of biochar (Fig.
1e
), suggesting the generation of extra delocalized electrons in CG
25
. For comparison, biochar was produced from palm leaves at 550 °C resulting in SSA that was notably lower (1.43 m
2
g
−1
; Supplementary Table
1
) than CGs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the CG samples also reveal two dominant peaks at 284.6 eV (denoted as Peak1) and 285.2 eV (denoted as Peak2), corresponding to the graphitic structure and defective carbon, respectively
26
,
27
. The highest Peak2/Peak1 ratio of 0.62 is obtained for CG950 (Fig.
1f,g
and Supplementary Fig.
4
), in agreement with our XRD and Raman results. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images depict the presence of significant amounts of cavities (that is, defects) in the graphite-like sheets (Supplementary Fig.
5
)
28
.
Furthermore, we used cyclic voltammetry (CV) to evaluate the electrochemical property of the CGs. A typical feature of the EDL capacitor has been observed for CGs
29
and a specific capacitance of 196.17 F g
−1
is obtained for CG950 which is noticeably higher than those for other CGs (19.39–62.72 F g
−1
) and biochar (~1.04 F g
−1
) (Fig.
1h
and Supplementary Fig.
6
), probably benefiting from its superiority of a highly porous structure
29
. To quantitatively evaluate the electron exchanging capabilities of CGs
15
, two electrochemical parameters, namely, electron-accepting capacity (EAC) and electron donor capacity (EDC), were further measured. Figure
1i
illustrates that the EAC of CGs gradually increases with pyrolysis temperature and reaches the optimum of 0.60 mmol e
−
per g for CG950, which is considerably higher than their respective EDC (0.07–0.11 mmol e
−
per g C) (Fig.
1i
), indicating the preference of CGs for storing and charging electrons. More importantly, the EDC and EAC of CG950 are found considerably higher than that of biochar (0.03–0.04 mmol e
−
per g C for EDC; 0.04–0.29 mmol e
−
per g C for EAC) (Fig.
1i
), showing its potential advantage in ET
14
. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was adopted to identify the potential redox-active groups (for example, quinoids) on CGs which may act as reaction sites for O
2
adsorption and activation
14
,
15
. A characteristic peak at ~1,600 cm
−1
is attributed to the stretching vibration of quinoid groups (C=O and C=C) on CGs and is evidenced in CG750–850 (Fig.
1j
)
16
,
30
. This peak positively shifts by ~40 cm
−1
by further increasing pyrolysis temperature (Fig.
1j
). Such a change implies enhanced electron delocalization and reduced resonance energy in CG950. Thus, the cumulative evidence explicitly demonstrates the presence of significant amounts of defects and redox-active quinoid groups which probably favour ET from CGs towards the surface-bound O
2
.
Radical identification
We evaluated the capability of CG for O
2
activation and As(III) oxidation using CG950 as a representative. Three scavengers were used to probe the underlying ROS responsible for As(III) oxidation (that is, methanol (MT) and isopropanol (IPA) for •OH and 1,4-benzoquinone (BEQ) for O
2
•−
)
13
,
14
. Figure
2a
shows that As(III) is completely oxidized to As(V) in the presence of CG950 under oxic conditions (pH 7.5), while the As(III) oxidation ratio decreases by 95% in the presence of BEQ, indicating the presence of O
2
•−
radicals and their efficiency towards As(III) oxidation
30
; more importantly, the addition of MT or IPA negligibly affects As(III) oxidation (Fig.
2a
), implying that O
2
•−
radials are the sole ROS formed and are exclusively responsible for As(III) oxidation in our reaction system. EPR analysis captured a typical 1:1:1:1 tetraploid assigned to the 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-
N
-oxide (DMPO)–O
2
•−
adduct
31
in the CG950 suspension under oxic conditions (Fig.
2b
). Furthermore, the cumulative O
2
•−
concentration in the CG950 system is found to be ~2.0 μmol g
−1
(reaction time 1 h), which is significantly higher than that (~0) by biochar (Fig.
2c
), showing the superiority of CG950 as an O
2
activator over traditional carbonaceous materials. These results consistently confirm that CG (CG950) is capable of activating O
2
to form O
2
•−
radicals probably through a one-ET process between quinoid groups and O
2
in our reaction systems. Since quinoid C=O groups act as reaction sites of CG for ET with O
2
through its intermediate semiquinone radical (SQ
•−
) (
E
°ʹ(Q/SQ
•−
) = +99 mV), the change in the redox-active quinone groups on CG before and after the reactions was evaluated by XPS. The results show that the quinoid C=O content of CG950 decreases by 22.7% after reactions, which is more than those (10%–20.8%) of other CGs (Supplementary Figs.
2d
and
7
and Supplementary Table
2
), confirming the key role of these quinoid C=O groups as reaction sites in O
2
•−
production and As(III) oxidation.

Efficient oxidation of As(III) by CG
After confirming the formation of O
2
•−
radicals activated by CG and its predominant role in As(III) oxidation, the performance of the four CGs (CG750–1,050) on As(III) oxidation was compared at pH 7.5. Our results show that compared to other CGs, CG950 exhibits the highest oxidation extent of ~100% (~40.1% for CG850 and ~69.4% for CG1050) (Fig.
3a
), which is consistent with the structure and electrochemical evidence of CG950. The oxidation extents of As(III) were further normalized to the surface area of different CGs to identify the potential role of SSA and results indicate that CG950 still exhibits the highest As(III) oxidation extent per unit of SSA (0.10% per m
2
g
−1
) compared with CG850 (0.05% per m
2
g
−1
); however, the reactivity of CH950 was comparable to CG1050 (0.09% per m
2
g
−1
). This finding suggests that the superior oxidation capacity of CG is probably attributed to both its high SSA and the surface defects. Interestingly, increasing the reaction pH to 8.5 significantly stimulates the oxidation extent of As(III) by CGs (for example, ~100% oxidation of As(III) by CG950 and CG1,050) (Fig.
3b
), while a solution pH of 5.5 only resulted in up to 14% oxidation efficiency (Supplementary Fig.
8
). This observation is attributed to the preferential formation of O
2
•−
radicals under relatively neutral and alkaline conditions
13
. Superoxide is prone to disproportionation reactions under acidic conditions (H

, H

+ O
2
•−
+ •HO

→ H

O
2
+ O
2
), thereby lowering the reaction efficiency
32
. Meanwhile, the As(III) oxidation kinetics by CG750–1,050 can be successfully described by the first-order kinetics equation (Supplementary Table
3
), implying that the formation of O
2
•−
radicals probably depends on the reactivity of CG exclusively. The rate constants (
k
1
; 0.029–4.73 h
−1
) for the As(III) oxidation by CG950 are orders of magnitude higher than those for CG850 and CG1,050 and markedly increase at a higher pH (4.73 h
−1
at pH 8.5) (Fig.
3c
), which is probably attributed to a kinetically enhanced ET process between CG950 and O
2
(ref.
33
). The oxidation of As(III) by CGs before removing the Ca
5
(PO
4
)OH mineral (acid etching) was evident, which is probably explainable by blockage of the reaction sites of CGs by the intertwined minerals (Supplementary Fig.
9
). CGs also exhibit greater As(III) oxidation capacities compared to other well-known carbonaceous materials, including commercial activated carbon and carbon nanotubes, which also possess great SSA and porosity (Fig.
3d
)
19
. Although the capability of biochar in As(III) oxidation was observed, the negligible oxidation of As(III) may be attributed to the specific reaction condition in previous studies, where considerably high ratios of biochar dosage with As(III) concentration were used
13
,
34
. To this end, these experimental results demonstrate that As(III) oxidation can be efficiently facilitated by CGs (for example, CG950) under oxic conditions.

Evidence of redox activity and electron-transfer rate
Given that the reactivities of these CGs pyrolysed at different temperatures are distinctly different, their surface thermodynamics and kinetics probably play a crucial role in mediating the ET process. Thus, we used differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) analysis to characterize the ET process on CG-coated electrodes, with ferrocene used as a standard chemical redox probe
35
. Figure
4a
reveals apparent reduction peaks corresponding to electron transfer from the CG electrodes to ferrocene and the reduction peak current for CG950 is noticeably higher than that of other CGs and biochar, indicating that CG950 has more favourable thermodynamics for electron donation. In addition to more favourable thermodynamics of CG950 compared to other CGs, the ET rate constant (
k
0
) for CG950 is 1.6 × 10
−3
cm s
−1
which is substantially higher than those for other CGs (that is, 0.79 × 10
−4
–1.4 × 10
−3
cm s
−1
; Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Figs.
10
and
11
). Researchers reported that carbon matrices could transfer electrons at different rates
16
, in which the ET rate constant between CG and the probe is closely associated with their graphitization degrees and defects
20
; in particular, defects in carbonaceous materials act as conductive bridges for accelerating the ET process
28
. Thus, it is likely that relatively higher abundant quinone groups and defects on CG950 substantially lead to an enhanced ET rate constant for CG950 compared to other CGs, resulting in enhanced As(III) oxidation
36
. In contrast, the redox peak intensity observed for biochar (Supplementary Fig.
10a
) was three orders of magnitude lower than that for CG950 (Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Fig.
12
) which explains a poor oxidation efficiency of As(III) by biochar.

Cyclic performance of CG
To demonstrate the sustainability of CG for ROS production, we further explored its capability of electron storage and rechargeability. First, we used a 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS)-mediated electrochemistry analysis (MEA) to track the electron flow from CG950 to the electrode mediated by ABTS
15
, thus allowing for calculation of the change in EDC value for CG950 (Fig.
5a
). Notably, pristine CG950 exhibits higher cumulative currents than reacted CG950 (that is, electrons partially replenished) as a result of electron discharging (Fig.
5b
). Recharging of reacted CG950 leads to enhanced cumulative currents, confirming its superior electron chargeability and storage
37
. Accordingly, pristine CG950 exhibits a considerably higher EDC (0.106 mmol e
−
per g C) than reacted CG950 (0.051 mmol e
−
per g C) and is comparable with that (0.117 mmol e
−
per g C) of recharged CG950 (Fig.
5c
). Thus, we conducted redox cycling experiments to determine the rechargeability/reusability of CG950 and found that the As(III) oxidation efficiency remained constant at 100% after five charge cycles, indicating an excellent and sustainable performance of CG950, in contrast to biochar which resulted in negligible As(III) oxidation after four cycles (Fig.
5d
). The cumulative concentrations of O
2
•−
were also measured during the redox cycling experiments and showed stable production of O
2
•−
radicals during each cycle (Fig.
5e
). To ascertain the stability of capacitance during the charging/discharging process, we compared the galvanostatic charge and performance discharge (GCD) of CG950 and biochar. Figure
5f
depicts a stable symmetric isosceles triangle shape of the GCD curve for CG950 corresponding to typical pseudocapacitive characteristics
29
. Conversely, biochar instantly lost its capacitance after stepwise cycling (Fig.
5g
), which probably occurs as a result of the unstable nature of redox moieties on biochar. These results clearly demonstrate that CG can sustainably charge and discharge electrons, resulting in O
2
activation and thus O
2
•−
production.

Thus, we propose a sustainable O
2
•−
generation strategy with the rechargeable supercapacitor through O
2
activation (Fig.
5h
). The presence of abundant structural defects on the graphite-like sheet of CG results in extra delocalized electrons, which can transfer electrons to quinoid functional groups for SQ
•−
generation
33
. As a result, electrons from both SQ
•−
and delocalized electrons can be transferred to O

for O
2

production; as a consequence, the generated O

enables oxidatively converting As(III) to As(V)
38
. The outstanding performance of CG for ROS production is probably determined by the great capacitance and EAC, providing a high electron storage capacity for further O
2
activation. Additionally, a satisfactory ET efficiency between CG and O
2
is essential and catalysed by the defective carbon matrix of CG.
Proof of concept
Considering the potential interference of competing species present in polluted water, we tested the effects of diverse inorganic ions and humic acid on the As(III) oxidation by CG. The presence of common ions (for example, cations such as Ca
2+
and Mg
2+
and anions such as SO
4
2−
and PO
4
3−
) showed negligible effect on As(III) oxidation, demonstrating that these ions are unlikely to influence O
2
•−
production. Humic acid appears to slightly inhibit As(III) oxidation (Fig.
6a
), probably because of its competition for electrons with O
2
(ref.
39
). Such results indicate that the ET from CG towards O
2
for O
2
•−
production is of high selectivity against complex matrices in water. Additionally, water samples from a local lake, irrigation ditch and the Pearl River were tested to further verify that complex water matrices would not affect the performance of CGs. Our findings show that 92%–99% of the As(III) was oxidized in these complex natural waters (Fig.
6b
), confirming that O
2
•−
radicals can be readily produced by CG under these representative natural waters. Further combination of CG with a typical As-adsorbent, goethite (Gt) can significantly improve the removal efficiency of As(III) from 40% to 87% (Supplementary Fig.
13
), benefiting from the As(III) oxidation by CG because of a high adsorption affinity of As(V) with Gt (ref.
40
). This clearly demonstrates that treatment can be achieved which simultaneously results in efficient As detoxification and removal from contaminated water. CG was also tested with an additional range of diverse organic and inorganic pollutants to confirm that the CG can be used for treatment of a broad range of water pollutants (Fig.
6c
). The degradation rates of all organic pollutants (5 mg l
−1
) are considerably higher (~100%) and the possibility of simple adsorption can be ruled out as a removal mechanism. Interestingly, Cr(VI) was also able to be effectively reduced by O
2
•−
(Fig.
6c
), indicating a broad application potential of O
2
•−
radicals for water treatment
41
. We further fabricated a portable and chargeable continuous-flow device by embedding CG950 into a carbon fibre cloth to demonstrate the applicability of this concept (Fig.
6d
and Supplementary Fig.
14
). The As(V) concentration in the effluent ranged from 0.82 to 0.91 mg l
−1
, which is equivalent to an As(III) oxidation efficiency of 82%–91% during charging/recharging cycles (Fig.
6e
), suggesting that this portable O
2
•−
generation technology is a feasible approach for water treatment and should be considered in future pilot or full-scale studies.

To examine the potential of this O
2
•−
generation system to produce other potent ROS such as •OH radicals, the concept of radical propagation was tested by simply using iron (Fe) oxyhydroxides which are widely present in natural water and soils. Noticeably, the presence of •OH radicals was observed after the addition of Fe (Supplementary Fig.
15a
), which is further confirmed with our EPR analysis showing typical signals of the DMPO–•OH adduct with a significant peak signal compared to that without adding Fe (Supplementary Figs.
15b
and
16
). This can be explained mechanistically by the generation of O
2
•−
which can directly reduce Fe

to Fe

and also produce •OH through the Fenton reaction (Fe

. The success in generating other potent ROS can greatly extend the potential of this green technology for treating other more recalcitrant organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
Superoxide radical, a potent green oxidant, has demonstrated its potential in the abatement of various pollutants in water and soil
43
, while the quest for a green and sustainable approach to its production remains a significant challenge. Our initial findings indicate that O
2
•−
radical can be sustainably generated through O
2
activation with rechargeable CG. The abundant defects and redox-active quinone moieties in CGs facilitate highly efficient electron transfer towards O
2
for O
2
•−
generation without requiring chemical agents. This particular feature presents opportunities to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches by eliminating the need for chemical activators such as H
2
O
2
and persulfate. The outstanding electron rechargeability and stable capacitance properties also allow for re-using the catalyst, thus enhancing practical applications while reducing the treatment cost. In addition, there is also high significance in producing other potent ROS to expand the application of this system in water treatment. At present, our results have demonstrated the feasibility of generating •OH, by simply adding iron oxides into this O
2
•−
generation system, while further efforts are needed in future studies to improve carbonaceous supercapacitors, such as through metal anchoring
44
, to enable facile and efficient multiple ROS generation. Overall, this study presents an environmentally sustainable strategy for O
2
•−
generation aimed at effective pollutant abatement, potentially paving the way for a paradigm shift in the water treatment industry and potentially extending to soil remediation.
Methods
Preparation of CGs
The chemical reagents were of analytical grade and are provided in Supplementary Text
1
. A CG was prepared on the basis of the O
2
-limited pyrolysis method according to our previous report
45
. Cattle bones were selected since they consist of abundant Ca
3
(PO
4
)
2
minerals which can serve as a natural template for top-down preparation of porous CGs. In brief, dried cattle bone powder was added to a tubular furnace and pyrolysed at 750–1,050 °C for 1 h under a flow of N
2
gas. Subsequently, the obtained solid powders were washed with 3 M HCl and rinsed repeatedly with Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm
−1
) to ensure the complete removal of salts. The resulting powders were dried at 60 °C overnight and then stored for further use. The prepared CG samples were denoted as CG
x
, where
x
refers to the pyrolysis temperature. Meanwhile, palm leaves were used to prepare biochar at 550 and 950 °C under an N
2
atmosphere. Detailed characterization methods for the structural and physicochemical properties of CGs are given in Supplementary Text
2
.
Batch experiments
Kinetics experiments related to As(III) oxidation by CG under oxic conditions were conducted in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 25 ± 1 °C. An appropriate amount of As(III) stock solution was added to 20 ml of CG suspension (0.1 g l
−1
) solution to achieve an initial concentration of 5 mg l
−1
for As(III). The pH of the reaction solution was maintained at 5.5, 7.5 and 8.5 by boric acid buffer (5 mM). Then, the mixtures were immediately placed on a rotating shaker (200 rpm) at 25 ± 1 °C to initiate the oxidation reaction. At predetermined time intervals, the reaction suspension was sampled with a syringe membrane (pore size 0.22 µm) for As(III) and As(V) analysis. For comparison, a similar experimental procedure was performed under anoxic conditions in an anaerobic glove box (O
2
< 0.1 mg dm
−3
). In addition, biochar, commercial activated carbon and carbon nanotubes were selected for comparison as counterparts for CG at pH 8.5. The effect of ions and natural organic matter on the As(III) oxidation by CG was investigated in the presence 10 mg l

Quenching experiments
To explore the potential ROS responsible for As(III) oxidation induced by CG950, different scavengers, including MT, IPA and BEQ, were used to selectively quench •OH and O
2
•−
(ref.
46
). The concentration of these scavengers was set to 500 times the initial As(III) concentration to ensure their complete reaction with the potential radicals. The solution pH was maintained at 7.5 by boric acid buffer (5 mM). After 5 h of reaction, the reaction suspension was filtered through a 0.22 µm filtration membrane for As(III) and As(V) concentration analysis.
Charging/oxidation cycling experiments
For the As(III) oxidation cycle experiments, we charged the reacted carbonaceous materials using an electrochemical workstation (CHI-920d) and then used them for As(III) oxidation again. In detail, the ET mediator Zwitterionic viologen 4,4′-bipyridinium-1,1′-bis(2-ethylsulfonate) (ZiV) was added to the reacted suspension, the working electrode was poised at −0.84 V and CG950 and biochar in the cells (0.1 M KCl, pH 8.5) was charged for 1 h under anaerobic conditions. After charging, an appropriate amount of As(III) stock solution was added to the reaction system, shaken (200 rpm) under aerobic conditions for 2 h and then sampled for As(III) and As(V) concentration analyses. The As(III) concentration and CG950 and biochar dosages were 10 mg l
−1
and 0.2 g l
−1
, respectively. The entire experiment was repeated five times.
Electrochemical measurements
The ET and capacitive properties of the carbonaceous materials were determined using a CHI-920d electrochemical workstation. A standard three-electrode configuration was used, which consists of working, platinum counter and reference electrodes (Ag/AgCl). The EAC and EDC of CG were determined in an anaerobic glove box (O
2
< 0.1 mg dm
−3
) to ensure anaerobic conditions
15
,
30
. EDC was used to evaluate the electrons stored in the material. The working electrode potential was poised at −0.49 V and +0.61 V for the EAC and EDC measurements of carbonaceous materials, respectively. ZiV and ABTS were selected as ET mediators. When the working electrode was placed in 30 ml of electrolyte (0.1 M KCl; 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7), the background current response stabilized. Subsequently, 1 ml of ZiV or ABTS solution (10 mM) was added to the electrolyte. After the background current was unchanged, 0.2 ml of CGs and biochar suspension (4 g l
−1
) was added to the electrolyte and a peak current occurred and then dropped to a steady state. The calculation of EAC and EDC was based on previous studies
15
.
For DPV measurements, CG750–1,050 and biochar were coated on the working electrodes. The DPV analysis of the carbonaceous materials was performed through a potential sweep from −1 to 1.2 V (potential step increment of 0.005 V, amplitude of 0.05 V and pulse period of 0.05 s). Different scan rates (50–400 mV s
−1
) from oxidation to reduction of CV were used to describe the ET kinetics of CG and biochar. The ferrocene derivative (dimethylaminomethyl) ferrocene (FcDMAM) had the fastest ET response and was selected as the direct ET probe
21
. The electrolyte was 3 mM FcDMAM and KCl (0.1 M) in phosphate buffer at pH 7. The detailed calculation method of the direct ET rate constants (
k
0
) is provided in Supplementary Text
3
(ref.
16
). For GCD experiments, the galvanostatic charge was set at 0.0001 A and cycled five times.
Application experiments
Three typical natural water samples, that is, lake water, river water and irrigation water were sampled from local sites for testing the performance of CG950 under real conditions and their water chemistry is provided in Supplementary Table
4
. To determine the potential interference of complex matrix, batch experiments were conducted by spiking proper amounts of As(III) into these water samples to achieve an initial As(III) concentration of 5 mg l
−1
before the addition of CG950. After reactions for 6 h, suspensions were filtrated and the production of As(V) was analysed by liquid chromatography coupled with atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (LC–AFS). For testing the performance of CG combing with Gt, Gt was initially prepared according to our previous work
47
; and kinetics experiments with and without Gt (the dosage of Gt was 0.5 g l
−1
) were conducted for comparisons as the same condition in batch experiments. For testing CG to remove other organic and heavy metal pollutants, the same batch experiments as As(III) were performed by simply replacing As(III) with other organic pollutants and Cr(VI) as detailed in Supplementary Text
4
. For testing the possibility of converting O
2
•−
to •OH radicals, DTPA-binding Fe(III) (200 μmol l
−1
) was introduced into the CG950 reaction systems and benzoic acid (the initial concentration was 100 μmol l
−1
) was used as a probe to quantify the concentration of the generated •OH radicals
48
. Column experiments were performed by packing the CG950-embedded carbon fibre cloth in a glass column (10 mm in diameter × 100 mm in length), where CG950 (1 g) was coated onto a working electrode made of a carbon fibre cloth (55 mm width × 60 mm in length) using a 0.1% nafion solution (Supplementary Fig.
14a,b
). The concentration of As(III) from inflow was 1 mg l
−1
and the flow rate was 2.2 ml min
−1
. Water samples from the effluents were collected at determined time intervals for As(V) analysis. After each cycle, the column was refilled with a KCl (0.1 M) electrolyte solution and the packed carbon fibre was directly recharged using a CHI-920d electrochemical workstation (CHI Instrument) (Supplementary Fig.
14c
), before further continue-flow reactions.
Analytical methods
The concentrations of As(III)/As(V) after the reactions were analysed using Kylin S12 LC–AFS (Beijing Jitian Instrument Company). The potential O
2
•−
and •OH radicals generated in the CG950 reaction system were captured on an A300 EPR spectrometer (Bruker) after their reaction with DMPO as a spin-trapping reagent to form DMPO–O
2
•−
adducts. The 2,3-Bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-((phenylamino)carbonyl)-2H-tetrazolium sodium salt (XTT, 0.05 M) was selected as an indicator to quantify the concentration of O
2
•−
(ref.
49
). XTT was reduced to XTT-formazan and detected using ultraviolet-visible spectrometry (UV-3600plus, Shimadzu) at 475 nm, where the extinction coefficient of XTT-formazan is 23,800 M
−1
cm
−1
(ref.
