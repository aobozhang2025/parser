. Here we found that treating these catalysts at temperatures between 750 and about 1,000 °C in the presence of CO and NO in steam (reactive treatment under reducing atmosphere) leads to the dispersion of ceria nanoparticles into high-density 2D (roughly one atomic layer thin) Ce
x
O
y
domains, as confirmed by microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These domains, which densely cover the alumina, exhibit substantially enhanced oxygen mobility and storage capacity, facilitating easier extraction of oxygen and the formation of Ce
3+
sites and oxygen vacancies. As a result, these catalysts—whether with or without PGMs, such as Rh and Pt—show improved activity for several industrially important catalytic reactions, including NO and N
2
O reduction, as well as CO and NO oxidation, even after exposure to harsh ageing conditions. This study shows a catalyst architecture with superior redox properties under conditions that typically cause sintering, offering a pathway to more efficient metal–ceria catalysts for enhanced general catalysis.

Despite notable progress in understanding ceria in automotive applications, questions remain about its behaviour under redox treatments with steam at elevated temperatures and its relationship to catalysis. Using advanced tools such as aberration-corrected/high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM/HAADF-STEM), in situ infrared spectroscopy, XPS, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), DFT modelling and catalytic measurements, this study provides new atomic-level insights into supported ceria nanomaterials, showing that approximately one-atomic-layer-thin Ce

We examined three catalyst samples: two commercially available ceria on gamma alumina with 8% and 50% Ce weight loadings, denoted CeAl08 and CeAl50 (Fig.
1
and Supplementary Table
1
), respectively, and a third sample, CeAl05, prepared in-house with 5% Ce on alumina, incipient-wetness impregnated with cerium nitrate and calcined in air to form ceria particles on alumina surfaces (Supplementary Fig.
1
). All three samples exhibit relatively low NO reduction activity, with CeAl50 showing the highest performance owing to its higher (50%) ceria loading. However, their activity remains low without PGMs. AC-STEM images of the fresh samples (Fig.
2
) show ceria nanoparticles mixed with the alumina phase and a sparse population of Ce single atoms in CeAl08 (approximately 1% by weight, based on energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in regions containing exclusively single sites).

In gasoline vehicles, catalysts are typically exposed to harsh conditions (800–950 °C in the presence of pollutants and steam), leading to ceria sintering and diminished catalytic activity. Here we subjected three samples to hydrothermal ageing in the presence of reactants (referred to as ‘reactive HTA treatment’) at 800–950 °C and found that their NO reduction activity (Fig.
1
) increased rather than decreased after this reactive treatment (with N
2
, N
2
O and NH
3
being the typical reaction products, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
2
).
To assess this effect, we further treated the samples in the presence of air with 10% water vapour (referred to as HTA ageing or treatment) at 800–950 °C, resulting in a reversible loss of activity. Further reactive treatment restored the enhanced activity. Therefore, reactive HTA treatment induces reversible changes that benefit catalysis. To explain this unexpected result, we performed AC-STEM/HAADF-STEM imaging on samples exposed to reactive treatments and air/steam treatments.
Marked changes were observed in the CeAl08 sample (Fig.
2c,f
). Reactive treatment caused ceria nanoparticles to disintegrate into a high concentration of Ce
x
O
y
domains on the alumina surface. In HAADF-STEM, for which brightness is proportional to approximately Z
1.7
, Ce atoms—being much heavier than Al—appear much brighter. The alumina surfaces/edges were densely covered by non-crystalline, disordered Ce
x
O
y
domains. High-resolution STEM images of the reactively aged 0.1 wt% Rh/CeAl08 sample (Extended Data Fig.
1
) show a non-conformal layer of disordered Ce
x
O
y
domains about one atomic layer thick (Supplementary Fig.
3
). This is a previously unknown architecture for supported ceria catalysts. EDS analysis estimates that the 2D Ce
x
O
y
domains on typical high-surface-area alumina can reach up to approximately 10 wt%.
When the sample is further treated in air/steam, these 2D Ce
x
O
y
clusters disappear, agglomerating into ceria nanoparticles. Similar trends are observed for the CeAl50 sample after 950 °C HTA ageing. The analogous behaviour of the in-house-prepared CeAl05 sample (Supplementary Fig.
1
) indicates that reactive treatment at 800 °C is sufficient to disperse ceria nanoparticles. Notably, samples exposed to several treatment cycles at these high temperatures with steam exhibit improved catalytic activity compared with fresh samples. Some deactivation occurs as a result of ceria sintering into particles too large to redisperse, as shown in Fig.
2c,i
and Supplementary Fig.
4
. However, the presence of 2D ceria clusters substantially enhances activity, both with (see discussion below) and without PGMs.
We suggest that the formation of the catalytically active Ce
x
O
y
phase on alumina is driven by the reduction of ceria nanoparticles at high temperatures in a reducing gas environment. Because ceria particles can only accommodate a limited number of oxygen vacancies while retaining the fluorite crystal structure, progressive bulk reduction at high temperatures destabilizes the nanoparticles and they wet the support (in this case, alumina) surface, forming 2D Ce
x
O
y
. We further confirm this by showing that treating CeAl08 with dilute hydrogen at 800 °C similarly disperses most ceria nanoparticles into roughly one-monolayer-thin Ce
x
O
y
domains on the alumina surface (Supplementary Fig.
5
), consistent with a previous report showing the disappearance of crystalline ceria reflections on high-temperature H
2
treatment of CeO
2
/Al
2
O
3
(ref.
13
). A similar catalytic effect is observed for ceria–zirconia nanoparticles supported on alumina (Supplementary Fig.
6
). High-temperature reactive (reductive) treatment activates this catalyst (Extended Data Fig.
2
and Supplementary Figs.
7
–
13
), forming roughly one-monolayer-thin ceria–zirconia patches that densely cover the alumina surfaces, as evidenced by high-resolution AC-STEM imaging and EDS mapping (Supplementary Figs.
9
–
13
).
To understand the state of ceria in these clusters and the mechanism behind the enhanced activity for NO reduction and redox catalysis, we conducted XPS analysis on the reactive-treated (reactive HTA) and air/steam-treated (HTA) samples (Fig.
3a,b
and Supplementary Figs.
14
–
16
). For HTA CeAl08, the Ce signal largely resembled typical CeO
2
nanoparticles
19
,
20
(Fig.
3
). The XPS estimate of Ce content was about 10 wt% (Supplementary Tables
2
and
3
), measured at two different spots. This value, although close to the nominal CeAl08 content, is used comparatively to assess the changes in surface ceria concentration between different treatments. For reactive-treated samples, notable changes were observed, particularly the marked presence of Ce
3+
species in the spectra (Fig.
3a,b
). The XPS-derived surface Ce concentration increased to around 14–15 wt%, consistent with HAADF-STEM data, indicating nanoparticle disintegration. While the sample was exposed to air at room-temperature post-reactive treatment before transferring to XPS, causing some reoxidation of reduced ceria nanoparticles, the 2D Ce
x
O
y
retained a substantial population of Ce
3+
sites, unlike CeO
2
nanoparticles. This suggests higher extractability/reactivity of lattice oxygen (that is, oxygen storage capacity, OSC). XPS results are treated qualitatively to avoid controversies with deconvolution of reduced ceria bands. Similar changes are observed for the CeAl50 sample (Fig.
3b
and Supplementary Table
3
), consistent with the reactivity data and AC-STEM images. However, owing to a higher Ce content, ceria nanoparticles remain visible (Fig.
2
), as the alumina’s saturation capacity with Ce has been reached. Subtle shifts are also noted in the XPS spectra for Al 2p and O 1s signals (Supplementary Figs.
17
–
22
). For the reactive HTA-treated CeAl08, the Al 2p signal shifts by about 0.4 eV to lower binding energies (73.8 versus 74.2 eV), consistent with the changes induced by 2D Ce
x
O
y
domains. We further used EXAFS (Supplementary Figs.
23
–
26
and Supplementary Table
4
) to corroborate our XPS findings and HAADF-STEM data and examine the Ce
3+
/Ce
4+
distributions. The fresh CeAl08 sample contains ceria nanoparticles, as indicated by its L
3
EXAFS line shape matching the CeO
2
standard (Supplementary Figs.
23
–
25
), consistent with HAADF-STEM data. By contrast, after in situ reduction with H
2
at 400 °C, the reactively treated CeAl08 (at 900 °C) with 2D Ce
x
O
y
domains shows 66% Ce
3+
(Supplementary Table
4
and Supplementary Fig.
24
), whereas fresh CeAl08 has about 30% of Ce
3+
after in situ reduction with H
2
. This confirms the XPS data, demonstrating that the ultrathin Ce
x
O
y
domains on alumina have much higher OSC and oxygen lability, crucial for redox reactions such as CO/NO oxidation and N
x
O
y
reduction, in which oxygen is first extracted by a reductant (CO), forming Ce
3+
species/oxygen vacancies essential for N

transformations, confirmed by infrared spectroscopy below.

We further investigated the surfaces of reactive treated CeAl08 using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with CO probe molecule (Fig.
3c
). Room-temperature measurements showed no discernible CO signatures, indicating the absence of pentacoordinate Al sites, as these are the only sites capable of strongly adsorbing CO under ambient conditions on alumina surfaces
21
. This is consistent with high-field solid-state
27
Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data (Supplementary Fig.
27
), which show no measurable pentacoordinate Al
3+
ions. We then performed CO adsorption at liquid-nitrogen temperature (77 K; Fig.
3c
), yielding an intense C–O stretching band at 2,173 cm
−1
from OH groups interacting with CO and no bands from CO adsorption on pentacoordinate or tetra-coordinate Al sites. After heating the sample in approximately 1 Torr oxygen at 800 °C for 1 h and investigating with CO at 77 K, a shift in the C–O stretching band of the Al–OH–CO complex from 2,173 to 2,178 cm
−
1
(Fig.
3c
) was observed, consistent with XPS Al 2p data showing a slight increase in positive charge on Al owing to Ce
3+
agglomeration into CeO
2
nanoparticles. A new C–O stretching band appears (about 2,220 cm
−
1
), indicating CO adsorption on tetra-coordinate Al sites
21
exposed after O
2
treatment removed dispersed Ce
3+
-rich species. Notably, no bands were observed for pentacoordinate Al sites (about 2,235–2,240 cm
−
1
), suggesting that they remain occupied by Ce cations and unavailable for CO adsorption. Apparently, two types of dispersed Ce site are present on alumina surfaces. (1) Ce associated with pentacoordinate Al sites, confirmed by AC-STEM images (Fig.
2
), showing a small amount (about 1 wt%) of atomically dispersed Ce persisting, even after harsh O
2
/H
2
O treatments. These pentacoordinate Al sites adsorb metal cations strongly
21
,
22
and remain on the surface during reactive/steam and air/steam treatment. (2) 2D Ce
x
O
y
domains that form during high-temperature reactive-steam treatments from redispersed ceria nanoparticles, containing abundant Ce
3+
cations and oxygen vacancies, which are substantially more catalytically active than ceria nanoparticles. To examine activity, we performed in situ co-adsorption of NO/CO on the reactive-treated CeAl08 sample containing Ce
x
O
y
clusters (Supplementary Fig.
28
). NO was adsorbed at 77 K on a CO-saturated surface, followed by heating to 298 K. An absorption band developed at 2,247 cm
−
1
, substantiating the formation of N
2
O (Fig.
3d
), owing to the presence of Ce
3+
, which participates in NO reduction
23
. Ce
4+
sites on oxidized ceria are inactive for NO adsorption and transformation, as confirmed by infrared experiments (Supplementary Fig.
29a
). Only when the ceria surface is reduced (for example, by CO at 500 °C), forming Ce
3+
and oxygen vacancies, did NO adsorption and activation occur, leading to N
2
O and N
2
formation (Supplementary Fig.
29b
). Thus, Ce
3+
sites are essential for ceria reactivity towards NO (refs.
23
,
24
). Once N
2
O forms, the oxygen vacancy is refilled:
$${\rm{Ce}}({\rm{III}})(2{\rm{NO}}){\rm{Ce}}({\rm{III}})\to {\rm{Ce}}({\rm{IV}})-{{\rm{N}}}_{2}{{\rm{O}}}_{2}-{\rm{Ce}}({\rm{IV}})\to {\rm{Ce}}({\rm{IV}})-{\rm{O}}-{\rm{Ce}}({\rm{IV}})+{{\rm{N}}}_{2}{\rm{O}}$$
To demonstrate that NO reaction with ceria restores active oxygen, the sample was exposed to CO after the NO reaction, resulting in carbonate formation owing to CO
2
adsorption on the ceria surface (Supplementary Fig.
30
). In reactive-treated ceria/alumina, even after air exposure, Ce
x
O
y
retains abundant Ce
3+
sites that can activate NO below room temperature, forming N
2
O (about 2,247 cm
−
1
; Fig.
3d
), showing higher reactivity of 2D Ce
x
O
y
domains compared with ceria nanoparticles, which remain inactive at room temperature (Supplementary Fig.
29a
). Only Ce
3+
sites combined with oxygen vacancies are highly reactive. The key role of Ce is to shuttle between 4+ and 3+ oxidation states during catalysis. In ceria nanoparticles, most Ce is buried in the bulk, limiting the surface availability of Ce
3+
for redox reactions. In Ce
x
O
y
on alumina, up to about 10 wt% of ceria is fully dispersed as 2D Ce
x
O
y
domains, providing: (1) full exposure of Ce atoms to reactants; (2) increased OSC; and (3) abundant Ce
3+
.
DFT calculations confirm thermodynamically favourable transformation of CeO

nanoparticles into Ce
3+
-rich, single-atomic-layer clusters on (100) alumina facets (Fig.

. This reaction was found to be strongly exothermic by 17.48 eV (about 1.46 eV per cerium cation), even more so than in the absence of NO ligands, indicating that adsorption of NO promotes ceria particle fragmentation on the alumina support. These results confirm that the formation of Ce

system is thermodynamically favourable, which agrees with experimental observations of Ce

on alumina. DFT-calculated XPS features for Ce

in 2D Ce

(Supplementary Table

and Supplementary Table

).
The ability of ceria nanoparticles to form 2D Ce

with superior redox properties, while remaining stable under harsh conditions, offers new insights for more effective catalysts. As well as metal interactions, the mobility of oxides must be considered, adding a crucial dimension to ceria-supported materials—especially because industrially relevant ceria is alumina-supported

. To demonstrate the catalytic potential of 2D Ce
x
O

architecture, we show that PGMs (Rh and Pt) in contact with these 2D Ce
x
O
y
domains substantially enhance catalytic efficiency for key reactions, including NO and N
2
O reduction by CO (for both Rh and Pt), CO oxidation (Pt and Rh) and NO oxidation (Pt). CeAl08 and CeAl50 samples were loaded with 0.1% and 0.5 wt% Rh. Contrary to expectations, reactive treatment did not deteriorate catalytic activity; instead, Rh on ceria/alumina showed improved performance (Fig.
4a,b
and Supplementary Fig.
32
). High-temperature ageing in air/steam led to diminished NO reduction activity, explained by the agglomeration of 2D Ce
x
O
y
into ceria nanoparticles, which buried Rh ions, leaving them unavailable for adsorption and reaction. During reactive treatment, Ce redispersion at high temperatures reexposed Rh and Ce
3+
sites, restoring catalytic activity. This positive effect occurred even in the presence of oxygen during reactive treatment and reaction (Supplementary Fig.
33
). We further analysed the 0.1 wt% Rh/CeAl08 sample after eight ageing cycles (Fig.
4a
, the final eighth reactive HTA) using several characterization techniques (Supplementary Figs.
34
–
38
). High-resolution HAADF-STEM images (Supplementary Figs.
3
,
4
,
35
and
36
) confirmed the presence of a 2D Ce
x
O
y
phase densely covering the alumina surface with abundant Ce
3+
sites confirmed by XPS (Supplementary Fig.
34
). EDS maps (Supplementary Fig.
35
) showed atomically dispersed Rh with loadings close to nominal, together with Rh nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig.
36
). Both isolated Rh sites and nanoparticles were in contact with the 2D Ce
x
O
y
phase, aligning with FTIR spectroscopy results (Supplementary Fig.
37
). Lower-resolution TEM images (Supplementary Fig.
4
) revealed larger ceria crystallites without Rh, consistent with X-ray diffraction (XRD) data (Supplementary Fig.

We extended our findings to other critical catalytic reactions, such as CO/NO oxidation and N

catalyst to reactive treatment at 820 °C shifted the CO oxidation curve by about 100 °C, achieving CO conversion at 150 °C (Fig.

). A similar reactivity promotion was observed for N
2
O reduction with the Rh/CeAl08 catalyst by reactive treatment shifting the curve by about 100 °C (Supplementary Fig.
47
). We further explored this by loading Pt, important for diesel oxidation. For reactions relevant to diesel oxidation (NO and CO oxidation; Supplementary Fig.
48
), the activity of the reactively treated sample was higher than that of the fresh catalyst or those mildly reduced. Moreover, NO reduction activity for Pt/CeAl08 increased similarly to Rh samples after reactive treatment (Supplementary Fig.

domains formed on commercial catalysts exhibit superior redox properties and reactivity for key industrial reactions (CO and NO oxidation and NO and N

Methods
Materials
We purchased cerium nitrate hexahydrate with purity 99.999% from Sigma. Commercially available SBA-90 gamma alumina with surface area 90 m

g

was used for the synthesis of 5 wt% ceria/alumina sample. Commercial samples with nominal 8% and 50% ceria supported on gamma alumina were supplied by BASF. Commercial sample with about 25 wt% ceria–zirconia on alumina (zirconia to ceria weight ratio approximately 60:40) was supplied by BASF. Commercial pure gamma alumina powder with surface area about 180 m
2
g

was supplied by BASF.
Polyhedral ceria nanoparticles were prepared by decomposing cerium nitrate in the muffle furnace at 650 °C (referred to as standard ceria nanoparticles).
To prepare the loadings of Rh on supports of 0.1 wt% and 0.5 wt%, the desired amount of Rh precursor (rhodium nitrate hydrate; Sigma) was dissolved in the minimum amount of water (total volume approximately equivalent to the pore of support) and added with a micropipette to the desired amount of sample while continuously stirring with the spatula to ensure uniformity. The obtained powder was dried under N
2
flow at 80 °C and then calcined at 600 °C for 1 h in a normal muffle furnace with a ramp rate of 5 °C min
−1
. The as-prepared Rh-containing catalysts were pressed, crushed and sieved to 60–80 mesh.
The analogous synthesis method was used to prepare the desired amounts of Pt on supports: platinum tetramine nitrate (from Sigma) was used as a Pt precursor.
Catalytic experiments
Catalytic experiments were conducted in a plug-flow reactor system with powder samples (120 mg, 60–80 mesh) loaded in a quartz tube, using a synthetic gas mixture containing 460 ppm of NO and 1,750 ppm of CO balanced with N

at a flow rate of 300 sccm (corresponding to gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) 150 l (g h)

Concentrations of reactants and products were measured by an online MKS MultiGas 2030 FTIR Gas Analyzer with a gas cell maintained at 191 °C. Two four-way valves were used for gas switching between the reactor and the bypass. The heating rate was 4 K min

We performed hydrothermal ageing with oxygen (HTA) at the desired temperature for 5 h (unless noted otherwise in the text) in a flow reactor with GHSV ≈ 150 l (g h)

A light-off curve was also obtained after exposing the catalyst to reducing treatment with CO at 375 °C (for 30 min), as it was previously shown to improve the CO oxidation reactivity of Pt/ceria catalysts.

Characterization
We conducted Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface-area analysis on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument with Ar as the adsorbate. Before analysis, the samples were dehydrated under vacuum for 3 h at 250 °C.
Microscopy samples were dispersed in ethanol and mounted on holey carbon grids for examination in a JEOL NeoARM 200CF transmission electron microscope equipped with spherical aberration correction to allow atomic resolution imaging and an Oxford AZtec Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy system for elemental analysis (for microscopy imaging at the University of New Mexico). The microscope is equipped with two large-area JEOL EDS detectors for higher throughput in the acquisition of X-ray fluorescence signals. Images were recorded in annular dark field (ADF) mode and in annular bright field (ABF) mode.
We performed microscopy analysis at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) with a FEI Titan 80-300 microscope operated at 300 kV. The instrument is equipped with a CEOS GmbH double-hexapole aberration corrector for the probe-forming lens, which allows for imaging with 0.1 nm resolution in STEM mode. HAADF-STEM images were acquired with a HAADF detector with inner collection angle set to 52 mrad.
We performed XPS experiments using a Physical Electronics Quantera scanning X-ray microprobe. This system uses a focused monochromatic Al Kα X-ray (1,486.7 eV) source for excitation and a spherical section analyser. The instrument has a 32-element multichannel detection system. The 80-W X-ray beam focused to 100 μm diameter was rastered over a 1.1 × 0.1-mm rectangle on the sample. The X-ray beam was incident normal to the sample and the photoelectron detector was at 45° off-normal. High-energy-resolution spectra were collected using a pass energy of 69.0 eV with a step size of 0.125 eV. Note that the samples experienced variable amounts of charging. Low-energy electrons at about 1 eV, 20 μA and low-energy Ar
+
ions were used to minimize this charging. The samples were loaded into the XPS cell after certain treatments in the flow-through reactor. After hydrothermal and reactive treatments, the samples were taken out of the reactor (exposed to ambient air) and then transferred to the XPS cell.
We collected XRD patterns on a Rigaku SmartLab SE X-ray diffractometer using a Cu–Kα radiation of 0.154056 nm (40 kV and 44 mA) and a D/teX Ultra 250 1D detector. Data were collected from a powder sample holder in a 2
θ
range 2–100°, with a step size of 0.01° s

. All measurements were performed under ambient conditions. Rietveld fitting was carried out using TOPAS (v6; Bruker AXS) with all atomic coordinates fixed. The contribution from Al

We performed
27
Al magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy using a 14.1-T Bruker NMR. At this field strength, the corresponding
27
Al Larmor frequency is 156.375 MHz. Spectra were acquired using a MASDVT600W2 BL2.5 X/Y/H probe at room temperature. Spectra were acquired following a single direct excitation pulse, with a total collection of 512 transients and an acquisition time of 9.9 ms. A delay between transients of 0.5 s was used and the excitation pulse was a single, π/20 liquid-state pulse of 0.450-μs duration. The liquid-state pulse widths are referenced by nutation experiments performed on a 1 M Al(H

solution, for which the resonance of the reference solution was assigned to 0 ppm. The
27
Al MAS NMR spectra were collected at a MAS spin rate of 20 kHz. The MAS NMR spectra were then processed in Mestrenova (version 14.01-23,559, released 2019-06-07; Mestrelab Research S.L.), in which the free induction decay was zero-filled once to 18.8 ms and then 5 Hz of exponential line broadening was applied.
We conducted the in situ transmission infrared experiments in a home-built cell housed in the sample compartment of a Bruker VERTEX 80 spectrometer, equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride detector and operated at 4 cm

resolution. The powder sample was pressed onto a tungsten mesh, which—in turn—was mounted onto a copper heating assembly attached to a ceramic feedthrough. The sample could be resistively heated and the sample temperature was monitored by a thermocouple spot-welded onto the top centre of the W grid. The cold finger on the glass bulb containing CO was cooled with liquid nitrogen to eliminate any contamination originating from metal carbonyls, whereas NO was cleaned with several freeze–pump–thaw cycles. Before spectrum collection, a background with the sample in the infrared beam was collected. Each spectrum reported is obtained by averaging 64 scans.
We conducted in situ XAS measurements in transmission mode at the 10-BM-B beamline at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory at the Ce LIII edge (5.723 keV) to determine the Ce oxidation state and coordination environment. Data were collected at room temperature in He for the as-received samples and after heating in 5% H
2
/He at 400 °C for 30 min and cooling to room temperature in He. Trace oxidants were removed from the He by an Oxy-Trap. All samples were ground into a fine powder, pressed into a six-shooter sample holder and sealed in a sample cell with Kapton end caps. Energy calibration was done using a Mn foil (K edge, 6.539 keV). XAS data were fit using WinXAS 3.1. Linear combination fitting from 5.68 to 5.75 keV of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) was used to estimate the fraction of Ce

(100) systems, on which two Ce

, which will be accompanied by the reduction of Ce
4+
to Ce
3+
. However, in none of the considered examples was such possibility realized. In both cases, when only one NO molecule is adsorbed, it interacts with three cerium cations (N interacts with two cerium cations, whereas O atom interacts with one). In NO/Ce

/Al
2
O
3
(100), these three cerium cations are in oxidation state +3, whereas the fourth cerium cation, which does not interact with the NO, is oxidized to Ce

, which means that the NO molecule is reduced to NO

. The binding of NO in that complex is strong, BE(NO) = −1.98 eV. In NO/Ce

O

(100), NO interacts with two Ce

2
O formation during deNOx processes. There are two Ce
3+
and two Ce
4+
centres in these structures, thus hyponitrite should be dianions, [ONNO]
2−
. The BE values per NO molecule in the two most stable structures are high, −2.56 and −2.44 eV, and the bonding of the hyponitrite moiety is similar (Supplementary Table

(100) structure, in which two of the cerium ions are in 3+ and the other two are in 4+ oxidation states (Supplementary Fig.

However, during the geometry optimization, spontaneous desorption of some of the NO molecules was observed. Only in the case of six dinitrosyl complexes are all 12 NO molecules bound to the cerium cations, although part of the NO ligands interact more weakly with cerium cations with respect to the situation with the 4NO/Ce

(100), with respect to the NO adsorption on small ceria particles, we considered the following model reaction:
$$12{\rm{NO}}/{{\rm{Ce}}}_{12}{{\rm{O}}}_{24}/{{\rm{Al}}}_{2}{{\rm{O}}}_{3}(100)+2\times {{\rm{Al}}}_{2}{{\rm{O}}}_{3}(100)\to 3\times 4{\rm{NO}}/{{\rm{Ce}}}_{4}{{\rm{O}}}_{6}/{{\rm{Al}}}_{2}{{\rm{O}}}_{3}(100)+{3{\rm{O}}}_{2}$$
Our calculations showed that the reaction is strongly exothermic by 17.48 eV, suggesting that isolated supported cerium nitrosyls are much more stable than ceria particles interacting with NO molecules.

(100), all Ce cations are in oxidation state 3+. The results obtained through the initial state approximation show that the energies of the 3d core levels of Ce

in the Ce

(100) model are lower than those of the Ce

(100). Using the Janak–Slater (JS) approach in which a half-electron is excited to the LUMO, similar results to in the case of the initial state approximation were obtained. The 3d levels of Ce
3+
cations are calculated at higher energies by 1.65 еV with respect to Ce
4+
cations in the Ce
4
O

/Al

O
3
(100) system. This is not the case for the JS
n
approach, in which half an electron is removed from the system. The 3d levels of Ce
3+
cations in the Ce
4
O
7
/Al
2
O
3
(100) model appear at lower energies by 0.34 eV with respect to the 3d levels of Ce
4+
cations in the same structure. The calculated core-level binding energies by final state approaches, FS and FS
n
, are also higher for Ce
4+
cations compared with that obtained for Ce
3+
cations in the Ce
4
O
7
/Al
2
O
3
(100) model. In conclusion, the initial state and JS approximations show similar trends and, in both cases, the 3d core levels of the Ce
4+
cations have lower energies compared with Ce
3+
and could be easily distinguished from those for Ce
3+
cations, as the shift is large enough—around 5 еV and 1.7 eV, respectively.
