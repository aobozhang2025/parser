Abstract
The catalytic activities of supported metal nanoparticles can be tuned by appropriate design of synthesis strategies. Each step in a catalyst synthesis method can play an important role in preparing the most efficient catalyst. Here we report the careful manipulation of the post-synthetic heat treatment procedure—together with control over the metal loading—to prepare a highly efficient 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalyst for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene. For Pt/TiO
2
catalysts with 0.2 and 0.5 wt% loading levels, reduction at 450 °C induces the coverage of TiO
x
over Pt nanoparticles through a strong metal–support interaction, which is detrimental to their catalytic activities. However, this can be avoided by following calcination treatment with reduction (both at 450 °C), allowing us to prepare an exceptionally active catalyst. Detailed characterization has revealed that the peripheral sites at the Pt/TiO
2
interface are the most likely active sites for this hydrogenation reaction.

Main
Supported metal nanocatalysts play a crucial role in our endeavour to develop new technologies for energy and environmental applications, including the production of fine chemicals and fuels from renewable and sustainable feedstocks while at the same time achieving reduced emission targets
1
,
2
. Selective hydrogenation reactions that are catalysed by supported metal nanoparticles are one of the most widely studied in academia and industry
3
. One typical example is the hydrogenation of nitroarenes to produce functionalized anilines that are commonly used in the production of a number of fine and bulk chemicals, including polymers, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, dyes and biologically active compounds
4
,
5
. Recently, researchers have focused on the chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to form anilines (especially in the presence of other reducible groups such as C=C, C=O, C≡C and C≡N) because of their high synthetic value
6
,
7
. Many reduction processes in industry still make use of stoichiometric reducing agents such as sodium hydrosulphite, iron in acidic media (the Bechamp process), stannous chloride, samarium iodide or zinc in ammonium hydroxide
8
,
9
,
10
. These methods are not only unselective, but they also generate huge amounts of unwanted waste. Catalytic reduction that uses molecular H
2
is highly desirable because of its economics and availability. Moleular H
2
is cheaper and readily available compared with other hydrogen donors and it is also environmentally benign as water is the only by-product
3
,
7
,
11
,
12
. However, achieving high chemoselectivity in this reaction without adding any homogeneous additives is still challenging. When hydrogen donors such as hydrazine
13
,
14
, formic acid
15
or sodium borohydride
16
,
17
are used, high chemoselectivities for nitro group reduction can be achieved. Recent advances in controlling the structure and properties of supported metal nanoparticles have renewed interest in the development of better catalysts for chemoselective hydrogenation reactions that use molecular H
2
(ref.
3
). For Pt/TiO
2
catalysts, alloying with a second metal (for example, Au, Ni or Zn) has also been reported to increase the chemoselectivity
11
. Corma et al. showed that monometallic Au nanoparticles (<5 nm) that are supported on Fe
2
O
3
could increase the selectivity (up to 99%) towards nitro group reduction during the hydrogenation of nitrostyrene
18
. Zhang et al. reported that atomic dispersions of Pt on FeO
x
were very active catalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation of nitrostyrene
19
; furthermore, they found that adding alkali metals to high loading Pt/FeO
x
catalysts—where nanoparticles are also present—increased the chemoselectivity dramatically
20
.
Every step in the catalyst synthesis process plays an important role in tuning the structural characteristics of the catalyst and in turn its activity, selectivity and stability. We have reported that the addition of an excess of chloride ions during wet impregnation helps control the particle size and composition of supported AuPd nanoparticles
21
. Heat treatment procedures are similarly critical in controlling metal particle size, morphology
22
and alloy formation
21
, as well as the removal of organic ligands or poisons
23
, thereby dramatically affecting catalytic performance
21
,
24
,
25
. Typical heat treatments employed for hydrogenation catalysts are as follows: the as-synthesized samples are usually calcined first to decompose the metal precursors on the support surface, which is followed by a gas-phase reduction (either in situ or ex situ) to reduce the metal ions to form the metal nanoparticles
11
,
19
. Corma et al. controlled the particle size and morphology of Pt nanoparticles supported on TiO
2
by choosing an appropriate activation temperature to tune the chemoselectivity during the hydrogenation of nitrostyrene
11
. Studies on the inter-relationship between metal loading and heat treatment are highly important because of the current drive to reduce the metal loading to efficiently use scarce and expensive noble metals
19
.
Here we report the catalytic performance of 0.05 wt%, 0.08 wt%, 0.2 wt% and 0.5 wt% Pt on TiO
2
for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene (3-NS) to 3-vinylaniline (3-VA) (Fig.
1
). This substrate was selected as there are two potentially reducible groups, making it a widely used model substrate for chemoselective hydrogenation reactions. The active sites have been fine tuned by optimizing the post-synthesis heat treatment protocol through systematically applying different high-temperature heat treatments (that is, either ‘red.’ (reduction only), ‘calc’ (calcination only) or ‘calc. + red.’ (calcination followed by reduction)) to all of these catalysts and we report the high catalytic activity exhibited by the 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘calc. + red.’ sample. All of these catalyst variants were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) as well as carbon monoxide diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (CO DRIFTS). This has allowed us to explore the complex interplay between the Pt loading level, heat treatment procedure and strong metal support interactions (SMSIs). We deduce that the extent of formation of exposed Pt peripheral sites with the TiO
2
support directly correlates with the activity of these Pt/TiO
2
catalysts.

Results
Hydrogenation of 3-NS
Initially, a 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalyst reduced at 450 °C was tested for the liquid phase hydrogenation of 3-NS at 40 °C under 3 bar H
2
pressure with toluene as the solvent. 3-Nitrostyrene was rapidly and selectively converted into 3-VA; plots of 3-NS concentration versus time were linear up to about 25% conversion (Supplementary Fig.
1
), giving an initial conversion rate of 1.55 × 10

with greater than 99% selectivity towards 3-VA (Fig.
2a
). Initial rates with different starting concentrations of 3-NS were used to confirm that reactions are zero order with respect to 3-NS (Supplementary Figs.
2
and
3
) for both 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
and 0.08 wt% Pt/TiO
2
. Other potential products such as 3-ethylnitrobenzene (3-ENB), which is formed by the selective hydrogenation of C=C, and 3-ethylaniline (3-EA), which is formed by the complete hydrogenation of both the nitro and C=C groups, were either not detected or were present only in trace quantities. In line with many other reports, the fully hydrogenated 3-ethyl-1-cyclohexylamine product was not detected under our reaction conditions; hence, it is not included in the discussion (Supplementary Fig.
4
). Inspired by the work of Corma et al.
11
, one portion of the dried-only 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
sample (see Methods) was calcined in static air at 450 °C for 4 h (calc.) and a second portion was calcined at 450 °C for 4 h and subsequently reduced using 5% H
2
/Ar at 450 °C for 4 h (calc. + red.) and tested for the hydrogenation of 3-NS under identical reaction conditions. The 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘calc. + red.’ catalyst was found to be much more active (with an initial rate of 6.04 × 10
−3
mol
3-NS
l
−1
min
−1
) compared with the 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ catalyst. However, the selectivity to 3-VA for the ‘calc. + red.’ catalyst was slightly lower (~96%) in comparison with the ‘red.’ catalyst because of the generation of the fully hydrogenated product 3-EA (4%, Supplementary Fig.
4
). Corma et al.
11
reported that a 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalyst reduced at 450 °C displayed growth of a TiO
2
layer over the Pt nanoparticles, resulting in higher selectivity to 3-VA (~90%). However, this same material reduced at 200 °C did not show any evidence of TiO
x
overgrowth on the Pt nanoparticles and displayed a much lower selectivity for 3-VA (~42%), with 3-EA (~52%) being the main product
11
. In the present study, the 0.2% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ and 0.2% Pt/TiO
2
‘calc. + red.’ materials (treated at 450 °C) only showed a difference in their catalytic activities (Fig.
2
) and not in their selectivities. To rationalize this observation, we prepared a series of Pt/TiO
2
catalysts with higher (0.5 wt%) and lower (0.05 and 0.08 wt%) Pt loadings (the initial rates for all of these catalysts are presented in Fig.
2a
). For all of the Pt loadings, the ‘calc.’ samples were found to be completely inactive and hence, for clarity, the data for these catalysts are not presented in Fig.
2
. For higher Pt loading catalysts (that is, 0.2 and 0.5 wt%), the reaction rates of the ‘red.’ catalysts were found to be lower (1.55 × 10
−3
mol
3-NS

−1

and 2.84 × 10

3-NS
l
−1
min
−1
and 1.11 × 10
−2
mol
3-NS
l

, respectively). Interestingly, for the 0.05 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalyst, the opposite trend was observed whereby the ‘red.’ catalyst was found to be much more active (8.35 × 10
−4
mol
3-NS
l
−1
min
−1
) compared with the ‘calc. + red.’ catalyst (1.59 × 10
−4
mol
3-NS
l
−1
min
−1
) under identical conditions. However, for the 0.08 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalyst, the ‘red.’ and the ‘calc. + red.’ samples displayed similar activity levels (that is, 1.75 × 10
−3
mol
3-NS
l
−1
min
−1
and 1.78 × 10
−3
mol
3-NS
l
−1
min
−1
, respectively). It is important to highlight that, irrespective of Pt loading or heat treatment protocol, the selectivity to 3-VA remained very high (>90%) for all of the catalysts. It should also be noted that the catalysts with higher Pt loadings (0.2 and 0.5 wt%) subjected to the ‘calc. + red.’ treatment showed slightly lower selectivity (because of the production of some 3-EA, which is a product of overhydrogenation) compared with the corresponding ‘red.’ samples (see 3-VA selectivity versus the 3-NS conversion plot, Supplementary Fig.
4
). These results demonstrate that the post-synthesis heat treatment protocols, combined with Pt loading. modulate the active sites for this chemoselective hydrogenation reaction. The initial rate data of all the ‘red.’ and ‘calc. + red.’ Pt/TiO
2
samples with different metal loadings are reported in Supplementary Fig.
1
.

As the catalysts have different Pt loadings, their conversion rates were normalized to allow for a meaningful comparison of their catalytic activities. The resultant TOFs (Fig.

2
pressure and higher metal loadings)
26
,
27
. In an effort to unravel the relationship between metal loading, heat treatment protocol and the nanostructural properties of these catalysts, all of these materials were comprehensively characterized using a complementary set of state-of-the-art microscopic and spectroscopic methods.
Electron microscopy studies
Figure
3
shows some representative high-angle annular dark-field–STEM (HAADF–STEM) images of ‘red.’ and ‘calc. + red.’ samples of Pt/TiO
2
catalysts with different Pt loadings (0.05, 0.08, 0.2 and 0.5 wt%). The corresponding images of the ‘calc.’ series of samples are presented in Supplementary Fig.
5
. This study allowed us to follow how the size and structure of the Pt nanoparticles change according to the heat treatment applied for each Pt loading level. For all of the ‘calc.’ samples, the vast majority of the Pt species are subnanometre clusters and highly dispersed single Pt atoms that are distributed over the support (Supplementary Fig.
5
). For the 0.05 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalyst (Fig.
3a,b
), the Pt particles found in both the ‘red.’ and the ‘calc. + red.’ samples were ultrasmall clusters; however, single Pt atoms were not detected. The ‘red.’ sample had a more uniform particle size distribution compared with the ‘calc. + red.’ catalyst, which correlates well with the observed catalytic activity trend. In the case of the 0.08 wt% Pt/TiO
2
material (Fig.
3c,d
), both ‘red.’ and ‘calc. + red.’ samples possess a very similar nanostructure with a uniformly small mean Pt particle size (1–2 nm) and reasonably similar particle size distributions. This observation again correlates well with the very similar catalytic activities noted for the ‘red.’ and ‘calc. + red.’ samples of the 0.08 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalyst (Fig.
2
). In the case of the 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalyst (Fig.
3e,f
), the ‘calc. + red.’ sample showed many small Pt particles (1–2 nm) that were uniformly distributed over the TiO
2
support. However, the corresponding ‘red.’ sample showed a wider distribution of Pt particle sizes (1–4 nm) with a larger mean particle diameter (1.6 nm). In the case of the 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalyst (Fig.
3g,h
), the ‘red.’ sample showed a mixture of smaller (~1–2 nm) and larger particles (>5 nm), whereas in the corresponding ‘calc. + red.’ variant, uniform particles are homogeneously distributed over the TiO
2
surface. The possibility of improving the metal dispersion in favour of small Pt particles by performing consecutive calcination and reduction treatments has been observed before
28
,
29
. Our microstructural observations correlate very well with the measured catalytic activites for these various Pt/TiO
2
catalysts, indicating that smaller Pt particles with high dispersion and narrow size distribution lead to higher overall catalytic activity. Analysis of the particle size distribution data for all of the samples in this study (Fig.
3
) reveals that those Pt/TiO
2
catalysts with the largest population of ~1 nm particles and the narrowest size distribution (that is, 0.08 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’, 0.08 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘calc. + red.’ and 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘calc. + red.’) also show the highest catalytic activity in terms of TOF values (Fig.
2b
).

XPS studies
All of the Pt/TiO
2
catalysts with different loadings and heat treatment protocols were characterized by XPS and the results are shown in Fig.
4
. It should be noted that the samples with very low loading levels (<0.1 wt%) gave noisy spectra even after an unusually large number of scans (>100). This signal-to-noise ratio problem was compounded by the presence of an overlapping Ti loss peak at ~75 eV, which made quantification of these particular spectra challenging

Full size image
Regardless of Pt loading, the XPS data were generally quite similar; thus, for conciseness of discussion. we will focus initially on the data acquired from the 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalysts.
For the dried-only sample, a Pt(4
f
7/2
) binding energy of 72.2 eV was measured, which is indicative of a Pt(
ii
) species and is presumably associated with residual chlorine as detected by XPS, although the presence of Pt oxides cannot be excluded
26
,
27
. Calcination of this highest loading sample revealed two distinct Pt environments: the first, again, with a binding energy of 72.2 eV and the second with a binding energy of 74.4 eV. Considering the calcination temperature employed (450 °C), the small concentration of Cl detected (~0.2–0.25 at%, see Supplementary Table
2
) and the nominal Pt concentration (~0.2 at%, see Supplementary Table
2
), a bulk PtCl
2
species is not the cause of the 72.2 eV signal; thus, this is probably a PtO
x
phase. The higher binding energy component at 74.4 eV can be assigned as PtO
2
or Pt hydroxide
31
. Both ‘red.’ and ‘calc. + red.’ catalysts exhibit Pt(0), as indicated by the asymmetric peak shape and a binding energy of 70.6–70.8 eV (ref.
32
). Representative HAADF–STEM lattice images of 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ (presented in Supplementary Fig.
6
) confirm the presence of a metallic Pt(0) structure in larger particles.
Depending on the heat treatments, the Pt(4
f
) signal strength could be very weak for the low Pt loading catalysts (0.08 and 0.05 wt%), especially for those materials that had undergone reductive treatments. This is attributed to changes in the particle size.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies
XAFS measurements were performed for the 0.05, 0.08, 0.2 and 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
(‘red.’ and ‘calc. + red.’) samples. Analysis of the XAFS data included interpretation of both XANES and EXAFS. The Pt L
3
-edge XANES spectrum is dominated by the dipole-allowed 2
p
3/2

d
5/2
transition of a core electron, which is known to be sensitive to the oxidation and coordination state of platinum
33
,
34
,
35
,
36
. In Fig.
5a,b
, the XANES plots show a comparison of samples with different metal loadings that underwent the same heat treatment: namely ‘red.’ (Fig.
5a
) or ‘calc. + red.’ (Fig.
5b
). Supplementary Fig.
7
also contains a plot of the XANES for the 0.05 wt% Pt/TiO
2
samples and the PtO
2
reference material. It is already possible from this overview to notice the variety of Pt species and environments present in these samples.

The XANES spectra in Fig.
5a
seem almost identical for the three lowest Pt loadings (0.05, 0.08 and 0.2 wt%), with a maximum in the normalised absorbance µ(
E
) trace seen at ~11,568 eV. It is noticeable, however, that the maximum of the rising absorption edge of the samples and the edge position is lower (red-shifted) compared with that of the reference PtO
2
phase (Supplementary Fig.
7
). The sample with 0.5 wt% Pt loading is especially red-shifted and its rising absorption edge possesses the lowest overall intensity, particularly at 11,568 eV. Previously it has been shown that such changes indicate differences in the extent of reduction/oxidation, with all of the samples possessing an average Pt oxidation state of less than +4, with the 0.5 wt% sample being more reduced than all of the samples with lower loadings, which are seen to be the most oxidized
37
. These observations are entirely consistent with the XPS and HAADF–STEM data shown in Fig.
4
and Supplementary Fig.
6
, respectively.
A similar situation can be seen for the ‘calc. + red.’ samples shown in Fig.
5b
, although, based on the intensity of the rising absorption edge, all samples (except those that contain 0.08 wt% Pt) seem more oxidized than after simple reduction (with the 0.08 wt% sample seeming to stay the same). To verify and even extract further information from these samples, the EXAFS FT data are plotted in Fig.
5c,d
. Focusing on Fig.
5c
(the ‘red.’ samples), it is clear that all except the 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ sample contain a strong peak at ~2.0 Å, which is assignable to a Pt–O distance typical of PtO
2
species (see Supplementary Fig.
8a
, which illustrates the similarities of the Pt–O distances in these samples compared to that of PtO
2
; refs.
38
,
39
). The intensity of the Pt–O contribution is much smaller in all of the reduced samples with respect to the reference PtO
2
and suggests that the Pt–O environments are more disordered. This can be rationalized as being a result of the static disorder caused by the high dispersion of PtO
2
species across the TiO
2
support and, according to the XANES, a partial reduction of Pt
4+
to Pt
2+
. Note that as a PtO reference is not readily available, it is not possible to unambiguously identify its presence nor rule out its absence. The 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ sample also contains a broad peak with a maximum intensity at ~2.73 Å, which is typical of Pt metal. Analysis of the EXAFS data (see Supplementary Fig.
9
and Supplementary Table
3
) for this sample suggests the existence of Pt nanoparticles that are ~1 nm in diameter
40
. For the 0.05 and 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ samples, weak peaks at 2.87 and 2.81 Å may also suggest the presence of a small amount of Pt metal in these samples, as well as a greater contribution from Pt-oxide.
Figure
5d
contains the FT data of the corresponding ‘calc. + red.’ samples, which are characterized by the presence of a strong Pt–O contribution in all of the samples, although the intensity of this contribution is inversely proportional to the amount of Pt present (see Supplementary Fig.
8b
, which illustrates the similarities of the Pt–O distances in the samples to that of the reference PtO
2
material). This is again consistent with the XANES data, which suggest the presence of more Pt
4+
in the samples after the ‘calc. + red.’ treatment; the 0.05 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘calc. + red.’ sample in particular contains Pt–Pt scattering contributions consistent with PtO
2
, indicating that some PtO
2
nanocrystallites may have evolved in this sample. For the 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘calc. + red.’ sample, the Pt–O peak possesses a skew and kurtosis towards higher Pt–O distances and—when considered along with the weaker absorption edge intensity—suggests the presence of more Pt
2+
. No real evidence for metallic Pt species could be seen on visual inspection, nor when attempts were made to fit the data.
CO DRIFTS analysis
CO DRIFTS analysis was performed on all of the Pt/TiO
2
catalysts to gain an accurate measure of the degree of Pt metal exposure on the surface of the catalysts. For all of the samples, a broad asymmetric band was observed between 2,050 and 2,060 cm
−1
, and for all of the ‘calc. + red.’ samples, a sharp band at ~2,089 cm
−1
was also present (Fig.
6
). It has been reported that the band at ~2,050–2,060 cm
−1
corresponds to CO molecules that are linearly adsorbed on low-coordination Pt-edge and -corner sites
11
,
41
,
42
,
43
,
44
. This infrared band is quite sensitive to a number of factors, including Pt dispersion, Pt microstructure (that is, steps, crystal faces and so on) and charge transfer in the vicinity of the Pt adsorption site. The band at ~2,089 cm
−1
corresponds to CO molecules that are adsorbed on the Pt(111) terrace sites with a coordination number of nine
11
,
43
,
44
,
45
. The Pt/TiO
2
system has also been widely reported to display an SMSI, especially when reduced at temperatures higher than 400 °C, which typically results in much lower uptake or adsorption of CO (ref.
46
). The 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ and 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ samples exhibit substantially lower CO adsorption, confirming the presence of an SMSI effect in these samples. The SMSI could be associated with the formation of bonds between the Pt metal and cationic or atomic Ti species, or by coverage of the Pt particle by a layer of TiO
x
as a result of hydrogen spillover. Corma et al. has reported TiO
2
coverage over Pt particles for a 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
sample reduced at 450 °C (ref.
11
). Following the combination of our CO DRIFTS data with reported interpretations, we consider that the Pt nanoparticles are covered by TiO
x
for the 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ and 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ samples, even though this layer was not resolved by STEM. Following analysis of the TOF values of these two samples from Fig.
2
, it is clear that their activities are much lower than all of the other samples tested (1,060 mol
3-NS
mol
Pt

h
−1
and 1,450 mol
3-NS

, respectively). Although some SMSI effects can be beneficial for increasing the chemoselectivity in this reaction, an excessive TiO
x
overlayer on Pt can be detrimental to the overall catalytic activity through complete site blocking. For the 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
and 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
catalysts that were subjected to the ‘calc. + red.’ treatment, the Pt particles were not completely covered by TiO
2
, leaving some Pt sites exposed for catalytic turnover. Although we could not directly visualize the surface coverage of Pt nanoparticles by TiO
x
, CO DRIFTS data provide convincing evidence for some TiO
x
coverage of Pt particles in the 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO
2
and 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ samples.

Full size image
It has previously been reported that peripheral sites at the Pt/TiO
2
interface are important for some selective hydrogenation reactions such as the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and furfuraldehyde
47
,
48
. Following this observation, the total number of peripheral sites for all of the Pt/TiO
2
catalysts examined were estimated by assuming that all of the Pt particles are half-‘sphere’ Mackay icosahedra (see Supplementary Table
4
), which is on the basis of the particle size distributions that were derived from the HAADF–STEM images. The total number of Pt peripheral sites (expressed as a weight percentage of the total catalyst mass) for the various Pt/TiO
2
materials are plotted in Fig.
7a
together with the 3-NS initial conversion rate.

A significant positive correlation is observed between the number of peripheral Pt sites and the catalytic activity (Fig.
7a
), which supports the proposition of Boronat et al. that the peripheral sites created where the Pt nanoparticles make contact with the TiO
2
support are very important for the selective hydrogenation of nitro groups
49
. A poorer correlation is observed when the same initial rate data were plotted against the total number of exposed surface Pt atoms (Fig.
7a
). The Pt surface area determined through CO chemisorption was plotted against the initial rate (Supplementary Fig.
11
), also giving a poor correlation. These data from two different methods indicate that the Pt surface atoms may not be the active sites. Post-synthetic heat treatment plays an important role in inducing SMSI effects in Pt/TiO
2
catalysts, which in turn has a profound impact on their resultant catalytic activities. High-temperature reduction induces coverage of Pt sites by TiO
x
. This problem can be eliminated, however, by employing a sequential calcination step followed by a reduction step. We propose performing the calcination step before the reduction treatment to more effectively anchor the Pt particles to the support and thus limit their subsequent mobility during the reduction treatment. From the particle size distribution data (Fig.
3
), it is evident that, among all of the catalysts tested, only 0.5 and 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘red.’ samples have metal particles that are larger than 2–3 nm. From the CO DRIFTS data (Fig.
6
), only these two samples show signs of TiO
x
coverage over Pt particles. This suggest a possible size-dependant TiO
x
coverage phenomenon that needs further detailed investigation. With the current data, we conclude that for samples with higher Pt loadings, a ‘calc. + red.’ treatment results in more active catalysts when compared with ‘red.’ catalysts. In the case of lower Pt loadings, due to high dispersion and relative scarcity of nearby Pt neighbours, even with a reduction-only treatment, there is little agglomeration of the Pt nanoparticles in spite of Pt mobility. Hence, the calcination pre-step is not necessary for samples with low Pt loadings. The collective electron microscopy and spectroscopic data obtained from all of the Pt/TiO
2
samples suggest that those materials with very small Pt particles (~1 nm) and without any significant TiO
x
surface coverage display exceptional catalytic performance.
Conclusion
Platinum nanoparticles supported on TiO
2
with different Pt loadings were found to be remarkably active and selective for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-NS to 3-VA. Among all of the catalysts tested, the 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO
2
‘calc. + red.’ material was found to be the most active. It was also the catalyst with the highest number of peripheral active sites generated as a result of the combination of ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles (~1 nm) with a tight particle size distribution in which the Pt particles were not covered by TiO
x
. This nanostructure was achieved by combining a calcination treatment at 450 °C with a subsequent reduction of this catalyst at 450 °C, thereby preventing any TiO
x
coverage of the Pt active sites. For the same 0.2 wt% level of Pt loading, a reduction treatment alone at 450 °C induces an SMSI effect that results in the partial coverage of active Pt sites and a less active catalyst.
Methods
Catalyst preparation
Supported Pt catalysts with different Pt loadings (0.05, 0.08, 0.2 and 0.5 wt%) were synthesized using the wet-impregnation method. The dried materials were then heat treated in a number of ways and tested for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-NS. For a typical catalyst preparation (2 g), the requisite amount of aqueous hydrogen hexachloroplatinic acid solution (9.6 mg Pt ml
–1
, assay 30.21% H
2
PtCl
6
, Johnson Matthey) was diluted to 16 ml using deionized water, and heated in an oil bath to 60 °C with vigorous stirring (800 r.p.m.) before the addition of the requisite amount of support (TiO
2
, Evonik P25). The temperature was subsequently increased to 95 °C for 16 h to dry the slurry in air. The resultant material was then ground thoroughly (referred to as the ‘fresh dried-only’ sample). A portion (500 mg) of the dried-only sample was either calcined in static air or reduced under a steady flow of 5% H
2
/Ar. Heat treatments were carried out at 450 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min
−1
. All of these materials were tested as catalysts without any further treatment unless stated otherwise.
Hydrogenation of 3-NS
Liquid phase chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-NS was performed in a 50 ml round-bottomed glass Colaver reactor. In a typical reaction, 3-NS (0.2 ml), toluene (8 ml) and catalyst (50 mg) were charged in the reactor that was then purged with N
2
to remove traces of air before being immersed in an oil bath set at 40 °C. After purging the reactor three times with 3 bar H
2
while stirring, the reaction was commenced. After a pre-determined reaction time, the reactor was cooled to <5 °C using ice, after which aliquots of the reaction mixture were collected and centrifuged to remove the solid catalyst. The liquid reaction mixture (1 ml) was added to a gas chromatography vial together with a fixed amount of external standard
o
-xylene (0.1 ml) for further quantitative analysis. The determination of the conversion was performed using a Varian 450-GC gas chromatograph equipped with a HP-5ms boiling-point column, a flame ionization detector and a CP8400 Autosampler. Conversion of the substrate and product selectivity were calculated using suitable calibration plots and response factors.
Catalyst characterization
XPS
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed using two systems; the first was a Kratos Axis Ultra delay-line detector spectrometer using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (with a source power of 140 W). An analyser pass energy of 160 eV was used for survey scans, and 40 eV for detailed acquisition of individual elemental regions. The second system was a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha
+
spectrometer that uses microsfocused monochromatic Al Kα radiation (with a source power of 72 W), with analyser pass energies of 40 and 150 eV. The data were analysed with computer-aided surface analysis for XPS, using escape depth-corrected sensitivity factors supplied by the instrument manufacturers.
STEM
Samples for examination by STEM were prepared by dry dispersion of the catalyst powder onto a holey carbon film that is supported by a 300 mesh copper TEM grid. Bright-field and HAADF–STEM images were taken using an aberration corrected JEM-ARM-200CF microscope operating at 200 kV. This instrument was also equipped with a Centurio silicon drift detector for X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (JEOL). The particle size distribution analysis was performed from analysis of HAADF electron micrographs using the ImageJ v.1.52i software package
50
.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy
XAFS spectroscopy measurements were performed on stations B18 and I20 at the Diamond Light Source (Oxon), operating at 3 GeV in multibunch mode with a current of 200 mA. Both stations are equipped with a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator, ion chambers for measuring incident and transmitted beam intensities and/or a multi-element Ge (fluorescence) detector for recording X-ray absorption spectra. The measurements were carried out in air on self-supporting wafers (approximately 100 mg) at the Pt L
3
-edge, and a 10-µm-thick Pt foil was used as a calibration sample for the monochromator. The measurements were performed at room temperature. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, multiple scans were taken. All data were subjected to background correction using Athena
51
(that is, an IFEFFIT software package for pre- and post-edge background subtraction and data normalization). The XAFS spectra were normalized from 30 to 150 eV above the edge energy, although the EXAFS spectra were normalized from 150 eV to the last data point using the Autobk algorithm. Normalization was performed between
μ
(
E
) and
μ
0
(
E
) by a line regression through the data in the region below the edge and subtracted from the data. A quadratic polynomial was then regressed to the data above the edge and extrapolated back to the threshold energy (
E
0
). The extrapolated value of the post-edge polynomial at
E
0
was used as the normalization constant;
E
0
is normally determined using either the maximum in the first derivative (approximately 50% of the rising absorption edge) or immediately after any pre-edge or shoulder features. The isolated EXAFS spectra were analysed using the DL-EXCURV
52
. The data were analysed using a least-squares single- or dual shell-EXAFS fitting analysis that was performed on data that had been phase corrected using muffin-tin potentials. An amplitude reduction factor (
S
o
2
) of 0.94 (obtained from fitting a Pt metal foil) was also used in the analysis.
CO DRIFTS
For the CO DRIFTS analysis, samples were loaded in a DRIFT Tensor 27 spectrometer and flushed with N
2
for 30 min to record a baseline. The sample was then exposed to 20% CO/Ar until complete saturation of the Pt sites was achieved. The system was then flushed with pure N
2
until there was no presence of atmospheric CO before the spectra were recorded.
