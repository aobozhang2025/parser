Abstract
The worldwide replacement of the toxic mercuric chloride catalyst in vinyl chloride manufacture via acetylene hydrochlorination is slowed by the limited durability of alternative catalytic systems at high space velocities. Here, we demonstrate that platinum single atoms on carbon carriers are substantially more stable (up to 1,073 K) than their gold counterparts (up to 473 K), enabling facile and scalable preparation and precise tuning of their coordination environment by simple temperature control. By combining kinetic analysis, advanced characterization, and density functional theory, we assess how the Pt species determines the catalytic performance and thereby identify Pt(
ii
)−Cl as the active site, being three times more active than Pt nanoparticles. We show that Pt single atoms exhibit outstanding stability in acetylene hydrochlorination and surpass the space–time yields of their gold-based analogues after 25 h time-on-stream, qualifying them as a candidate for sustainable vinyl chloride production.

/AC) (ref.

)) or an excess of catalyst leading to acetylene conversions of 100%—it is unfeasible to evaluate and compare the intrinsic stability of reported state-of-the-art systems. Alternatively, the identification of other active metal sites that can be sufficiently stabilized by the oxygen functionalities present in the relatively fouling-resistant activated carbon carrier
9
, could lead to the development of robust hydrochlorination catalysts. In this regard, platinum is a potentially promising candidate as it interacts very strongly with the surface oxygen groups of a broad range of metal oxide supports (for example, CeO

and additionally features a more flexible coordination chemistry with respect to gold
32
. Notably, Pt is also ~40% cheaper than Au (ref.

, likely due to the approximately seven times lower catalytic activity compared to Au-based systems, which might have discouraged detailed investigations into this metal. Nanostructuring of the active site has been proven pivotal for the success of gold and ruthenium-based catalysts, suggesting that platinum may also have considerable potential in acetylene hydrochlorination if nuclearity and host effects are optimally orchestrated.
Herein, we evaluate the properties and host effects of single-atom Pt catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination. For this purpose, we design a platform of Pt SACs with a tunable coordination environment (−Cl, −N neighbours) and oxidation state (
ii
and
iv
), by functionalizing the carbon support and using controlled thermal activation. Analogous to gold catalysts, we demonstrate that platinum single atoms exhibit superior catalytic activity and stability in acetylene hydrochlorination with respect to their nanoparticle-based counterparts. While the catalytic response is not affected by the choice of the carbon support (activated carbon or nitrogen-doped carbon), the latter determines the stability under reaction conditions. Specifically, pyrrolic-N sites were identified to promote a coking mechanism as rationalized by density functional theory (DFT). In direct comparison to Au/AC single-atom catalysts, which inexorably deactivate, Pt/AC SACs maintain a stable performance for 100 h, surpassing the space–time yields (STYs) of the former within only 25 h time-on-stream (t.o.s.). The origin of these differences is analysed by combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with mechanistic studies based on DFT.

Stability of platinum single atoms versus gold single atoms on carbon carriers
Carbon-supported platinum nanostructures ranging from single atoms to nanoparticles at a fixed metal loading (1 wt%) were derived via a two-step synthesis
9
,

comprising the incipient wetness impregnation of AC or polyaniline-derived N-doped carbon (NC) with a solution of H

dissolved in water (w) or aqua regia (a), followed by drying (static air, 473 K) and thermal activation at distinct temperatures (
T
act
, 16 h, N

atmosphere). The synthesis yielded three series of Pt-based catalysts: Pt/AC-a-
T
act
, Pt/AC-w-
T
act
and Pt/NC-w-
T
act
(Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Table
1
). The thermal activation was conducted in the range 473–1,073 K to avoid changes to the catalysts upon exposure to the reaction temperature of acetylene hydrochlorination (
T
bed
= 473 K) and to not exceed the carbonization temperature of the N-doped carbon support (1,073 K), preserving the total nitrogen content and speciation over the whole temperature range, as confirmed by N 1
s
XPS analysis (Supplementary Figure
1
). In all three low-temperature platinum catalysts (
T
act
=
473 K), the metal was atomically dispersed, as evident from STEM images and corroborated by the absence of platinum diffraction peaks in the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra (Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Figs.
2
–
5
). The synthetic simplicity of deriving carbon-supported platinum single atoms is a clear advantage over the harsh reaction conditions required to atomically disperse gold (that is, aqua regia as impregnation solvent)
9
. In addition, Pt single atoms exhibit superior thermal stability, remaining atomically dispersed up to 1,073 K on AC, while gold single atoms readily agglomerate above 473 K, if not stabilized by suitable metal anchoring sites such as nitrogen-containing functional groups
9
. Notably, the choice of impregnation solvent affects the thermal stability of Pt single atoms on AC, hinting at a decisive role of the surface functionalization of the carrier. In particular, the surface oxygen and chlorine contents (Table
1
), as derived from XPS analysis, differ markedly between the water-impregnated sample (4.2 at.% O and 0.2 at.% Cl in Pt/AC-w-473) and the aqua-regia-treated sample (7.1 at.% O and 0.8 at.% Cl in Pt/AC-a-473). Besides the carrier functionalization, the nature of the Pt site is also directly affected by the solvent choice, as analysed by combining XPS and XAS analyses (Fig.
1b,c
, Supplementary Figs.
6
–
8
and Supplementary Tables
2
–

). Fitting of the XPS spectra of the low-temperature water-based samples, Pt/AC-w-473 and Pt/NC-w-473, revealed a significant contribution at a binding energy (BE) of 72.4 ± 0.1 eV that is commonly assigned to Pt(
ii
) (ref.
37
). In aqueous solution H

undergoes fast hydrolysis, during which chloride ions are exchanged for water molecules
38
. In the subsequent impregnation step, the Pt(

x

x
)
−2+
x
) is partially reduced to Pt(
ii
) on the carbon support
39
. The low-temperature aqua-regia-based sample (Pt/AC-a-473) exhibits a major contribution at BE = 73.6 ± 0.1 eV, indicating differences in the coordination environment (that is, additional Cl neighbours) with respect to the water-based samples and/or a formally higher oxidation state, which can be tentatively assigned to Pt(
iv
) (ref.
37
,
40
). In good agreement with these results, the extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of Pt/NC-w-473, Pt/AC-w-473 and Pt/AC-a-473 indicates 2.3 ± 0.3, 3.2 ± 0.3 and 3.8 ± 0.2 Cl neighbours, respectively (Supplementary Table
4
). No peaks characteristic for Pt−Pt bonds were detected for the low-temperature samples, corroborating the atomic dispersion of platinum as visualized by STEM. With increasing thermal activation temperature, the coordination environment of the Pt single atoms in the Pt/NC-w-
T
act
and the Pt/AC-a-
T
act
series gradually changes from predominantly Cl- to O/N-neighbouring atoms (that is, 0.7 ± 0.1 Cl and 2.2 ± 0.2 O/N neighbours in Pt/NC-w-673 and 0.2 ± 0.1 Cl and 2.5 ± 0.1 O/N neighbours in Pt/NC-w-1,073). In addition, fitting of the first coordination shell further revealed a small Pt−Pt contribution with a coordination number (CN) of 1 ± 0.4 (Pt foil CN = 12) at a slightly enlarged coordination shell distance (
R
) of 2.93 ± 0.01 Å (Pt foil
R
= 2.76 Å)
41
, possibly indicating the presence of low-nuclearity Pt–N/O clusters (that is, dimers, trimers) in Pt/NC-w-1,073 and Pt/AC-a-1,073. For Pt/AC-w-1,073, a clear contribution of Pt(0) (BE = 71.2 eV)

is observed in XPS, which agrees well with the presence of nanoparticles, as visualized by STEM (Supplementary Fig.

To rationalize the remarkable stability of Pt single atoms and their evolution during thermal activation on carbon carriers with respect to their Au-based analogues (Fig.
2a
), DFT studies were performed. The NC and AC supports were represented by a set of basal (and
sp
3
) defects containing different nitrogen and oxygen functionalities
9
. To evaluate the interaction between the set of defects and the possible single-atom species, a screening of formation energies was performed using the blank metal atom, M, and the metal chloride, MCl (M = Au, Pt), as probes. Two general trends were identified: (1) N-containing defects form stronger bonds to Pt and Au species, with respect to their O-containing analogues and (2) Pt (or PtCl) species bind up to three times more strongly to the support than their Au (or AuCl) counterparts, regardless of the type of defect (O- or N-containing; Fig.
2b,c
and Supplementary Fig.
9
). Consequently, the stabilization of Au single atoms on O-containing defects is not sufficient to prevent their agglomeration at elevated temperatures, while Pt single atoms exhibit superior stability on both carbon carriers (AC and NC) if suitable oxygen and/or nitrogen functionalities are provided. The preferred single-atom species (M or MCl) depends for both metals on the geometry of the individual defects. Specifically, MCl species are preferred on all defects except those that allow a square planar geometry of the metal site M. The latter enable the metal atom to adopt the in-plane position in the centre of the cavities (that is, −0.23 eV for Au and −2.59 eV for Pt in the 4 × N6 cavity, with respect to the metal bulk reference), yielding configurations corresponding to Au(
iii
) and Pt(
ii
), respectively. The migration of single-atom (SA) species to these highly stable configurations is promoted by the removal of Cl that occurs at high catalyst-activation temperatures.

Activity descriptors for platinum catalysts
Acetylene hydrochlorination over the three series of Pt catalysts was studied at bed temperatures (
T
bed
) of 423–523 K with a GHSV(C
2
H
2
) of 1,500 h
−1
(Fig.
3a
). Analogous to the respective gold-based systems, 473 K was identified as the optimal reaction temperature and applied in all catalytic tests (Supplementary Fig.
10a
)
9
. Notably, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) was the only product detected in all tests by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, as is also commonly found for gold-based systems. Hence, the activity of Pt- and Au-based catalysts is directly represented and compared as the yield of VCM (
Y
(VCM)). The catalytic activity of the Pt/AC-w-
T
act
series markedly drops with increasing platinum mean particle size, indicating that like gold, platinum single atoms exhibit superior activity in comparison to their nanoparticle-based analogues (Fig.
3b
). In addition to the metal particle size, the metal oxidation state and the coordination environment of the single atoms strongly affect the performance (Fig.
3c,d
). Specifically, Pt(
ii
)−Cl single atoms are approximately twofold more active than their Pt(
iv
)−Cl and Pt(
ii
)−N(/O) analogues, yielding an overall activity hierarchy of Pt(
ii
)−Cl SA
≫
Pt(
ii
)−N SA ≈ Pt(
iv
)–Cl SA > Pt(
0
) nanoparticles. To gain a deeper understanding of the origin of these catalytic trends, we performed acetylene temperature-programmed desorption experiments (C
2
H
2
-TPD) with selected samples. In accordance with literature reports, Pt(
ii
) sites exhibited a significantly higher adsorption capacity for acetylene compared with their Pt(
iv
) analogues (Supplementary Figs.
11
and
12
)
35
. In addition to the metal oxidation state, the coordination environment of the single atoms affects their acetylene adsorption ability (Fig.
3e
). With an increase in N(/O)-neighbouring atoms, the adsorption capacity gradually decreases, while no apparent changes in the adsorption strength were observed. In this regard, the superior catalytic activity of Pt(
ii
)−Cl single atoms might be related to their relatively higher acetylene adsorption capacity in comparison to any other Pt-based site. Indeed, a correlation exists between the initial catalytic activity and the acetylene adsorption capacity of the Pt/NC series (Fig.
3f
). Despite the importance of the coordination environment of the Pt single atoms, the catalytic response is independent of the choice of carbon carrier (AC or NC) as long as the metal site is unchanged (that is, Pt/AC-w-473, Pt/NC-w-473; Fig.
3a
). Overall, the optimized Pt SACs reach approximately half of the initial catalytic activity of state-of-the-art Au SACs, which is more than three times higher compared with the activity levels reported in the literature for Pt-based catalysts, which were likely composed of Pt nanoparticles

Mechanistic studies
To gain atomistic insight into the structure–performance relationships of distinct Pt sites in acetylene hydrochlorination, DFT was employed. In addition to evaluating single-atom stability descriptors (Supplementary Fig.
9
), the full set of empty and occupied (Pt and PtCl) defects was probed for acetylene adsorption, previously identified as a key indicator of activity
9
. As all considered Pt single-atom species have vacant coordination sites, acetylene adsorption was found to be highly exothermic over both the Pt and PtCl sites (up to −3.35 eV for a single Pt atom in a 3 × N6 cavity) due to the formation of strong Pt−C bonds. The notable exception is the in-basal-plane square planar Pt(
ii
) species, where the only contribution comes from van der Waals (vdW) interactions (Fig.
4a,b
). Due to the relatively high Cl to Pt ratio found in all catalysts (Table
1
), the effect of incrementally closing the single-atom coordination sphere with Cl ligands on the acetylene adsorption ability was also evaluated. Since catalytic activity is a trade-off between stability and affinity towards the substrate, both were taken into consideration while identifying defects that are representative for the Pt/AC and Pt/NC catalysts (Supplementary Figs.
13
and
14
, respectively). A tri-pyrrolic (3 × N5) defect was chosen for NC and a di-epoxide (2 × Ep) defect for the AC system (Fig.
4c,d
). In both cases, closing the coordination sphere with additional chlorine ligands weakened the adsorption of acetylene from −2.29 eV (−2.85 eV) to −0.83 eV (−0.01 eV) for the Pt/NC (Pt/AC) system, accompanied by a corresponding increase in single-atom stability (Fig.
4e,f
). These results are well in line with the observed decrease in activity with increasing content of Pt(
iv
) species under reaction conditions (
vide infra
). Strong acetylene adsorption on Pt nanoparticles was found to be the reason for their low activity, as acetylene effectively poisons the surface because it is significantly more favoured than HCl (
E
ads
(HCl) = −1.03 eV,
E
ads
(C
2
H
2
) = −2.78 eV on Pt(111)). However, on MCl sites, strong acetylene adsorption is favourable, since Cl is already coordinated to the metal centre and the reaction coordinate can advance via insertion of acetylene in between Pt and Cl. This reduces the coordination of Pt and allows for the subsequent activation of HCl, followed by VCM evolution through a H transfer (Fig.
5
). The adsorption and subsequent activation of HCl as the first reaction step (Supplementary Fig.
15
) is less favourable as it leads to closing of the Pt coordination sphere and hence compromising acetylene affinity (Fig.
4
). This implies that anchored Pt(
ii
) species with one or two Cl neighbours should exhibit the highest performance in acetylene hydrochlorination. Since the Cl coordination mainly governs site reactivity, similar behaviours can be expected for both low-temperature AC and NC single-atom catalysts (Pt/NC-w-473 and Pt/AC-w-473). The high affinity of Pt towards unsaturated C−C bonds leads to strong VCM adsorption (−1.82 eV), which is likely the main factor for the inferior catalytic activity of Pt single-atom catalysts compared to their Au single-atom (−1.23 eV) counterparts. Increasing the activation temperature of the NC- and AC-supported Pt and Au catalysts lowers the Cl content and increases the population of the stable and inert basal-plane Pt(
ii
)/Au(
iii
) species. In principle, these sites can be activated by either HCl or acetylene, breaking two of the bonds to the support in order to form bonds with the substrate. However, these processes are endothermic (Supplementary Fig.
16
), rendering these sites (that is, Pt/NC-w-1,073) undesirable for VCM evolution and explaining their relatively low catalytic activity.

) of 650 h
−1
(Fig.
6a
). Pt/AC shows a stable performance over the course of 70 h, in strong contrast with the gradual deactivation of Au/AC. The origin of this diverging behaviour lies in the intrinsic stability differences of gold and platinum single atoms on AC; while the former readily agglomerate due to a lack of suitable metal anchoring sites, the latter remain highly dispersed, as visualized by STEM analysis of the used catalyst (Fig.
6b
and Supplementary Fig.
17
)

. Within ~25 h t.o.s., the activity of Au/AC drops below the conversion level of Pt/AC, demonstrating that Pt SACs are promising candidates for acetylene hydrochlorination. In view of the potential industrial application, the possibility of deriving stable Pt SACs via water-based impregnation is a significant advantage over the hazardous aqua-regia-based synthesis protocol commonly used to obtain Au SACs. Notably, the use of aqua regia can be avoided by employing sulfur-containing ligands (for example, thiosulfates)
20
, but clearly the catalytic activity of the water-derived Au–S/AC system is inferior to that of the pristine Au/AC and Pt/AC catalysts. On N-doped carbon, the active-site architecture is preserved for gold and platinum single atoms and graphene-confined Ru nanoparticles
25
under reaction conditions. However, the formation of carbonaceous residues, accompanied by a gradual pore blockage and decrease in surface area, lowers the acetylene adsorption capacity, with t.o.s. likely being the premier reason for catalyst deactivation, regardless of the choice of metal (Supplementary Figs.
12
and
18
and Supplementary Table
6
)
. In addition to the pore properties, the oxidation state of platinum and the coordination environment change under reaction conditions of acetylene hydrochlorination (Fig.
1b,c
). Specifically, the relative content of Pt(
iv
) quickly rises during the initial t.o.s. (60–80 at.%), accompanied by an increase in Cl neighbours (that is, from 2.3 ± 0.3 to 3.0 ± 0.3 for Pt/NC; Supplementary Tables

and

). In line with the relatively lower activity of Pt(
iv
)−Cl compared with Pt(

Origin of coke formation
To investigate the possible origin of the diverging coking tendency of AC and NC catalysts, we performed DFT calculations on the oligomerization paths. Considering that the selectivity of all catalysts towards VCM was found to be 100%, it can be assumed that the H-termination process on the PtCl active sites is sufficiently fast to prevent the growth of longer hydrocarbon chains. Therefore, the key differences in the coking behaviour must have their origin in the structure of the carbon supports (AC or NC). In fact, the metal-free supports show the same diverging trends in their pore properties with t.o.s. as do their metal-based analogues (Supplementary Table
7
and Supplementary Fig.
12
). The NC support contains a variety of N-heterocyclic moieties (Supplementary Table
3
) of which the most abundant are the pyrrolic (N5), pyridinic (N6) and graphitic (N3) N sites with approximately 50%, 30% and 10% of the total N content, respectively. The chemisorption of acetylene on a pristine graphitic surface (Fig.
7a
) or a graphitic N (creating a four-membered ring on the graphitic surface) is strongly hindered thermodynamically (
E
ads

2

2
) = 1.11 and 1.83 eV, respectively; Fig.
7b
). However, if a pyrrolic-N defect (
n1
,

) is in close proximity, the chemisorption of acetylene triggers the opening of the five-membered pyrrolic ring, allowing acetylene insertion and yielding a seven-membered ring. This process is highly exothermic (

h1
and
n1
, respectively). Another acetylene molecule can be recurrently chemisorbed exothermically
(n1*
,

Fig.

). The presence of a PtCl species on NC enables parallel (kinetically less favourable) coking paths, including acetylene coupling and facilitated acetylene insertion into the pyrrolic ring (Supplementary Fig.

). On the contrary, on an O-rich defect the effect of acetylene chemisorption is significantly less pronounced (

) and the main source of coking on AC is acetylene coupling over the initially predominating Pt(

Discussion
Nuclearity and host effects of carbon-supported platinum catalysts in acetylene hydrochlorination were systematically assessed by combining kinetic analysis, in-depth characterization and DFT studies, which enabled the identification of Pt(
ii
)−Cl single atoms as the active site, achieving approximately three times higher activity than any previously reported Pt-based system. While acetylene readily poisons the surface of Pt nanoparticles, inhibiting HCl adsorption, on Pt(
ii
)-Cl single atoms the adsorbed acetylene can be easily inserted between Pt and Cl, advancing the reaction coordinate. Additional Cl ligands in the coordination sphere increase the stability of the single-atom site but lower the acetylene adsorption ability, which results in an overall decrease in catalytic activity, as observed during the initial t.o.s. The choice of the carbon carrier (AC or NC) does not significantly alter the catalytic response of the Pt site, but the stability in acetylene hydrochlorination is markedly affected. Specifically, on NC, coking has been identified as the major reason for catalyst deactivation, which is possibly promoted by N-pyrrolic defects via the highly exothermic insertion of acetylene and formation of seven-membered rings. On the contrary, acetylene chemisorption on O defects is less favourable, explaining the significantly reduced formation of carbonaceous residues over Pt/AC catalysts. The intrinsic stability of Pt single atoms on this carrier endows them with unparalleled durability in acetylene hydrochlorination, ultimately surpassing the STYs of state-of-the-art Au- and Ru-based catalysts. This remarkable result in combination with the benign and easily scalable synthesis protocol for Pt SACs, as well as the significant price advantage over Au, finally qualifies the previously neglected metal and thereby opens up an alternative direction towards sustainable vinyl chloride production. Going beyond hydrochlorination, our approach to control the reactivity of platinum atoms is generally applicable to other areas and gives perspective for the tunability of metal species for a wide range of catalytic applications.
Methods
Catalyst synthesis
The NC support was prepared via a two-step synthesis, comprising the oxidative polymerization of aniline and a subsequent carbonization step
42
. Aniline (50 mmol, Acros, 99.5%) was dissolved in deionized water (40 cm
3
, pH 0.4; adjusted by hydrochloric acid, 1.25 M, Sigma-Aldrich, >37%), cooled to 277 K and subsequently added to a precooled solution (277 K) of ammonium persulfate (100 mmol, Acros, 98%) in deionized water (20 cm
3
) under vigorous stirring, using a magnetic stirring bar. Subsequently, the polyaniline slurry was kept for 24 h at room temperature without stirring, followed by filtering and washing with water (~0.75 l g
−1
). The formed polyaniline was dried in static air at 393 K for 12 h and carbonized at 1,073 K in N
2
atmosphere for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 K min
−1
. The obtained NC was ground and sieved into particles with a size of 0.4–0.6 mm. Commercial AC (Norit ROX 0.8) was immersed in aqua regia at room temperature to remove metal impurities. After filtration and thorough washing with deionized water (2 l g
−1
), the material was dried in static air at 393 K for 12 h and subsequently ground and sieved into particles with a size of 0.4–0.6 mm. All metal-based catalysts were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method (nominal metal loading of 1 wt%). Accordingly, a solution of the respective metal precursor, H

Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was conducted using a Horiba Ultra 2 instrument equipped with photomultiplier tube detection. The solids were dissolved in a 3:1 mixture of HNO

under sonication until no solids were visible. Elemental analysis of C, H and N was determined by infrared spectroscopy using a LECO TruSpec Micro combustion furnace. XRD was measured using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO-MPD diffractometer with Cu-K
α
radiation (
λ
= 1.54060 Å). The data was recorded in the 10–70° 2
θ
range with an angular step size of 0.017° and a counting time of 0.26 s per step. Argon sorption was measured at 77 K in a Micromeritics 3Flex instrument, after evacuation of the samples at 423 K for 12 h. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Linseis STA PT1600 system coupled to a Pfeiffer Vacuum Thermo-Star GSD 320 T1 mass spectrometer. TGA of the as-prepared catalysts and after use in acetylene hydrochlorination was carried out in diluted oxygen (20% O

to quantify the amount of coke deposits in the used catalysts. Temperature-programmed desorption of acetylene (C

by MS. STEM data with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector were acquired on a HD2700CS (Hitachi) microscope operated at 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dipping the copper grid supporting a holey carbon foil in a suspension of the solid in ethanol and drying in air. XPS data were acquired on a Physical Electronics Quantum 2000 instrument using monochromatic Al-K
α
radiation, generated from an electron beam operated at 15 kV, and equipped with a hemispherical capacitor electron-energy analyser. The samples were analysed at an electron take-off angle of 45° and a constant analyser pass energy of 46.95 eV with a spectra resolution step width of 0.2 eV. The spectrometer was calibrated for the Au 4
f
7/2
signal at 84.0 ± 0.1 eV. The elemental concentrations, given in Table
1
, were quantified based on the measured photoelectron peak areas (C 1
s
, N 1
s
, O 1
s
, Cl 2
p
) using PHI-MultiPak software and the built-in relative sensitivity factors, which are corrected for the system transmission function. The Pt 4
f
and N 1
s
spectra were fitted by mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian component profiles after Shirley background subtraction (68–81 eV for Pt 4
f
spectra and 309–405 eV for N 1
s
spectra). The selected peak positions of the Pt
7/2
doublet peak are based on data reported in the literature (71.2 ± 0.1 eV for Pt(0), 72.4 ± 0.1 eV for Pt(
ii
) and 73.6 ± 0.1 eV for Pt in a higher oxidation state, tentatively assigned to Pt(
iv
) (refs.
37
,
40
). The areal ratio of Pt
7/2
to Pt
5/2
was fixed to 4:3 and the peak separation to 3.33 eV. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the two Pt
7/2
and Pt
5/2
doublet peaks was locked to obtain the same values for each single component. However, for different components the FWHM was not restricted, resulting in small variations in the FWHM (±0.25) for different doublet peaks. These small variations occur due to locally differing environments (that is, variations in the chemical bonding with the second or third neighbouring atom and local variations in the Fermi level for compounds having a band gap). The selected peak positions for the four different nitrogen species were fixed to 398.4 eV (N6), 400.4 eV (N5), 401.1 eV (N3) and 403.0 eV (N0) with an error of ±0.1 eV (ref.
42
). The FWHM was not restricted, resulting in small variations (±0.25) for different peaks. The detailed fitting parameters, reported in the literature and used in this work, are given in Supplementary Tables

and

. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements at the Pt L

and L

edge were carried out at the SuperXAS beamline of the Swiss Light Source. The incident photon beam provided by a 2.9 T superbend magnet was selected by a Si(111) channel-cut Quick-EXAFS monochromator. The rejection of higher harmonics and focusing were achieved with rhodium-coated collimating and toroidal mirrors, respectively, at 2.5 mrad. The beamline was calibrated using Pt foil. The area of sample illuminated by the X-ray beam was 0.5 mm × 0.2 mm. The Pt catalysts (300 mg) were finely ground, mixed homogeneously with five parts of cellulose and pressed into 13-mm-diameter pellets. Commercial H

EXAFS spectra were acquired with a 1 Hz frequency (0.5 s per spectrum) and then averaged over 10 min. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were calibrated by measuring Pt foil simultaneously with each sample. The EXAFS spectra were analysed using the Demeter software package
44
. The background signal before the Pt L
3
edge was subtracted using a linear function (fitting range between –150 and –60 eV). The post edge signal was normalized to the step of one using a Victoreen function in the region between 150 and 1,300 eV after the edge. The background signal before the Pt L
2
edge was subtracted using a linear function (fitting range between –150 and –60 eV). The post edge signal was normalized to the step of one using a Victoreen function in the region between 100 and 600 eV after the edge. We fitted the k

-weighted Fourier-transformed signal and determined an amplitude reduction factor (
S

) of 0.83 from the EXAFS fit of the Pt metal foil. All EXAFS spectra were fitted for the first coordination shell in the k-range of 3.2–9.5 and 3.1–9.9 Å

, for the L

and L

edges, respectively, and the

After the tests, the reactor was quenched to room temperature in a He flow and the catalyst was retrieved for further characterization. All catalytic data points were determined as an average of at least two measurements. The evaluation of the dimensionless moduli based on the criteria of Carberry, Mears, and Weisz–Prater confirmed that all the catalytic tests were performed in the absence of mass and heat transfer limitations (see Supplementary Table

. While non-valent electrons were described by projector augmented waves (PAW)
50
,
51
, the monoelectronic valence states were expanded as plane waves with a maximum kinetic energy of 450 eV. Graphitic carbon slabs were modelled using a 6 × 6 supercell with three layers of thickness. The metal surfaces were modelled using a 4 × 4 supercell in the (111) orientation. For all systems, the top two layers of the slab were allowed to relax, and the slabs were separated by 12 Å of vacuum. The k-points sampling was a Γ–centred 3 × 3 × 1 grid (~0.3 Å
−1
). A dipole correction was employed along the
z
-direction normal to the slab faces
52
. The molecules were placed in a cubic box with sides of 15 Å. In all cases the optimization thresholds were 10
−5
and 10
−4
eV for electronic and ionic relaxations, respectively (VASP recommended and tested settings for graphitic materials). Transition states were located following the climbing image nudged elastic band procedure (CI-NEB)
53
. Transition states were confirmed by diagonalizing the numerical Hessian matrix obtained by displacements of ±0.02 Å. Simulated EXAFS spectra were generated using FEFF8 (ref.
