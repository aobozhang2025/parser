Abstract
Single-atom catalysts often exhibit unexpected catalytic activity for many important chemical and biological reactions with respect to their bulk counterparts, and have been recognized as potential substitutes for natural enzymes. Here we report a biomimetic composite, yolk–shell Pd

@Fe

, that features two compatible single-atom systems with atomically dispersed Fe
1
sites in a N-doped carbon shell and Pd
1
sites in a yolk derived from a metal–organic framework. Directly utilizing the O

and H

sources generated on-site from the electrocatalytic overall water splitting, the as-synthesized yolk–shell Pd

could simultaneously catalyse nitroaromatic hydrogenation and alkene epoxidation reactions and lead to a cascade synthesis of amino alcohols. Our findings provide a versatile strategy to integrate different single metal sites within one system to allow the continuous and easy synthesis of complex compounds for various challenging reactions.

Main
Nature carefully selects specific metal ions (Fe, Ni, Mn and so on) as active sites to incorporate into protein frameworks as metalloenzymes, which can catalyse a wide range of challenging biological transformations, which range from C–H functionalization to N
2
reduction under mild aqueous conditions
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
. Furthermore, natural systems composed of different metalloenzymes can catalyse oxidation and reduction reactions, which seems incompatible, but both occur in one cell-like system without degrading their efficiency and selectivity
5
. For example, in natural photosynthesis, solar energy is captured from the sunlight by the photosensitizers (for example, chlorophyll) to produce carbohydrate from building-block molecules of CO
2
and H
2
O (CO
2
+ H
2
O + solar energy → carbohydrate + O
2
) (ref.
6
). In the above-mentioned multicomponent charge-transfer converting system, light reactions feature an efficient water oxidation to yield O
2
and protons (H
+
) via releasing electronics. After a dark reaction, the H
+
derived from water oxidation react with CO
2
to generate a carbohydrate or other organic molecules via a reduction process. This means that two classes of incompatible oxidative and reductive reactions could operate in one system under mild conditions, which may be attributed to a highly separated spatial distribution of different metalloenzyme sites and corresponding non-interfering reaction pathways.
The reconstitution of the [Fe]-hydrogenase apoenzyme with a single-site Mn(
i
) has proved to be more effective for the activation of H
2
compared with that of the native [Fe]-hydrogenase
7
. Additionally, for the oxidative biochemistry process, the isolated Fe site in a biosynthetic model of haem–copper oxidase in myoglobin (Fe
B
Mb) shows a 30-fold enhancement in the O
2
activation with respect to that of Zn-bound mimics
8
. These atomically dispersed metal sites could serve as active centres to mimic the natural enzyme involved in the biological reaction
9
. To simulate the more realistic biological system, what is more difficult is how to incorporate different reactions into one system rather than replace the natural enzyme with an artificial single-atom nanozyme by mimicking the local structure of enzymatic active centres. To date, separated catalytic oxidations or reductions achieved from single-atom catalysts have been proved

. However, utilizing single-atom catalysts to simultaneously perform seemingly incompatible oxidation and reduction reactions in one system still remains a great challenge.
Here we report a biomimetic composite that features two compatible single-atom systems (CSAS) with atomically dispersed Fe
1
sites in a N-doped carbon shell and Pd
1
sites in a metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived yolk. Their atomistic structures were revealed by spherical aberration correction electron microscopy, X-ray absorption fine structure (XFAS) analysis and first-principles calculations. Directly utilizing the O

sources generated on-site from the electrocatalytic overall water splitting, the as-synthesized yolk–shell Pd

(denoted as PdCl

) (Supplementary Fig.

, PdCl

/UiO-66-NH
2
displayed a similar narrow size distribution (300–400 nm; Supplementary Fig.
2
) and almost unaltered X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffraction patterns (Supplementary Fig.

), which indicates that the introduction of PdCl
2
does not change the geometric structure and crystal structure of UiO-66-NH
2
. Then, an inert SiO

/UiO-66-NH

(Supplementary Fig.

A colour evolution from yellow to grey can be observed between UiO-66-NH

, which suggests a strong electrostatic adsorption

between Pd

ions and the electron-rich –NH

species (Supplementary Fig.

). During the pyrolysis process, the isolated Pd sites and Fe sites were anchored by the nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) derived from 2-aminoterephthalic acid (H

BDC-NH
2
) linkers and TiPP, respectively. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images reveal that the as-prepared yolk–shell Pd

@Fe

possesses an ultrathin N-doped carbon shell (~10 nm) and a MOF-derived octahedral yolk (Fig.

). To elucidate the form of the metal species after pyrolysis, we next carried out aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM measurements with sub-ångström resolution; the contrast is proportional to the atomic number

sites. The atomically dispersed Pd

sites at the edge of the octahedral MOF-derived yolk are circled (Fig.

). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig.

) further confirmed that the Pd and Fe atoms are present in a yolk–shell-like distribution. The actual loading of Pd and Fe in three-dimensional (3D) yolk–shell Pd

there appears two new peaks located at 398.7 and 408.5 eV (Supplementary Fig.

), which could be assigned to pyridinic N (
π

σ
* excitation), respectively. The result further demonstrates that both H

linkers and TiPP were destroyed and converted into defective NC under the high temperatures. Meanwhile, the emerging N defects, especially for pyridinic N (refs
29

), may provide abundant coordination sites for the stabilization of the atomic Pd and Fe species during pyrolysis. After the removal of SiO

(Supplementary Figs.

), a morphology evolution from three-layer core–shell–shell Pd

@SiO
2
@Fe

to a yolk–shell Pd

@Fe

structure was observed, which helps to expose more metal active sites and increase the surface area-to-volume (Fig.
1g
). As verified by Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) measurements (Fig.
1h
), yolk–shell Pd
1
@Fe
1
inherited a high surface area (~825 m
2
g
–1
) and showed a dual mesopore characteristic of pore sizes 2.4 and 3.6 nm. The smaller pore at 2.4 nm may be attributed to the ordered mesopores of the MOF-derived yolk
32
and the larger pore at 3.6 nm could be assigned to the radial mesopore channels of the TiPP-derived NC shell. This unique 3D yolk–shell configuration may be conducive to the exposure of catalytic sites and beneficial for an enhanced mass transport during organic synthesis reactions.

. D2 can be attributed to ferric X−Fe
iii
N

−Y high-spin species (X and Y refer to a C or N ligand), in which the Fe atom is slightly pulled out of the N

plane, which results in a deformed octahedral structure. D3 can be assigned to the N−(Fe
iii
N
4
)−N low-spin structure, in which the central Fe atom is strongly coordinated with four nitrogen atoms in graphitic layers. Additionally, the absence of sextets and singlets indicates the absence of Fe–Fe bonds, which further confirms the atomically dispersed distribution of Fe species. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is a powerful tool to investigate the chemical state and coordination environment of metal species

39
. As shown in Fig.
2c
, the absorption threshold of the Fe atoms (left blue shaded area) and Pd atoms (right blue shaded area), both situated between those of the corresponding metal foil and metallic oxide, show partially positive valence states. In addition, the oxidation state of the cationic Fe
1
sites and Pd
1
sites could also be verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (Supplementary Fig.
17
). From the
R
-space spectrum of the extended XAFS (EXAFS) shown in Fig.
2d
, only one dominant coordination peak around 1.5 Å can be assigned to the M

–C or M

–N (M = Pd or Fe) bond. The corresponding fitting results (Supplementary Figs.

However, it is difficult to discern the exact coordination environment of Pd or Fe sites by XAFS characterizations due to the almost identical bond distances of M–N and M–C (M = Pd or Fe). To explore what kind of the chemical environment is the most stable for anchoring single metal sites on carbon-based materials, we next performed first-principles calculations. The isolated metal atom sites can be anchored on the C or N defects. The interaction between the non-defective carbon layer and either Fe or Pd is weak. However, once the N atom with a strong electronegativity is introduced into the non-defective carbon layer, it would withdraw electrons from the adjacent transition metal atoms and make these isolated central atoms positively charged. Therefore, different C/N ratios were adopted to adjust the electronic structure of central metal atoms, to attach the most stable configuration. First, we performed the Bader charge analysis in different models to give a quantitative comparison of the charge transfer between the central Pd
1
and Fe
1
sites with various C and N coordinated heteroatoms (Supplementary Table
3
). As shown in Fig.
2e
, a strong correlation between the amount of positive charge on the Pd
1
or Fe
1
atom and the number of N atoms occurred. Pd
1
–N
4
and Fe
1
–N
4
were demonstrated to be the most stable structures for these metal atoms with various C/N ratios. An intuitive picture of the charge redistribution can be observed in both systems; the larger charge difference between the central Fe and neighbouring N atoms demonstrates a stronger stability of Fe
1
–N
4
compared with that of Pd
1
–N
4
. Also, compared with the inert noble metal Pd, Fe more actively loses outer electrons. The interaction between Fe and its neighbouring C and/or N atoms was calculated to be more pronounced than that of Pd. Such a result correlates with the deformation charge density analysis performed on Fe
1
–N
4
(Fig.
2f
) and Pd
1
–N
4
(Fig.
2g
). The improved structure stability induced by N can be further explained by the partial density of states. From Supplementary Fig.
20a
, the relative free-standing Fe in the FeC
4
structural motif shows electronic states around the Fermi level (0 eV). When N is introduced to the system, the electron density decreases and moves to a deeper energy level, which indicates that more electron transfer occurs from isolated Fe sites to neighbouring C and/or N atoms. The same phenomenon can be observed in the Pd
1
–N
4
structural motif (Supplementary Fig.
20b
). Additionally, possible oxygen-bearing moieties (–O, –O
2
and –OH), derived from air exposure or the support itself, could also be excluded around Fe
1
sites (Supplementary Fig.
21
) via simulated Fe K-edge spectra of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure
40
. According to the above analysis, Pd
1
–N
4
or Fe
1
–N
4
may be the dominating structural motifs in the as-prepared yolk–shell Pd
1
@Fe
1
. Furthermore, wavelet transform of Pd K-edge EXAFS shows only one intensity maximum at 4.6 Å
−1
, which corresponds to the Pd
1
–C or Pd
1
–N coordination, and further indicates atomically dispersed Pd sites in yolk–shell Pd
1
@Fe
1
(Supplementary Fig.
22
).

Spatial compartmentalization of isolated single-atom Pd and Fe sites within one system could be given a random or orderly distribution via precise chemical modulating. A rational and spatial construction of single-atom Pd and Fe sites may act as an ideal multifunctional catalyst to separately activate hydrogen and oxygen molecules through non-interfering reaction pathways (Fig.
3a
). We used the as-prepared yolk–shell Pd
1
@Fe
1
under a hydrogen and oxygen atmosphere for the direct synthesis of amino alcohols by a cascade reaction that follows the simultaneous hydrogenation of nitroaromatics and alkene epoxidation reactions. As shown in Fig.
3b
, styrene and nitrobenzene were continuously and selectively attacked by activated O
2
on the Fe

–C

(0 ≤
x
≤ 4) sites and H
2
on the Pd
1
–C
y
N
4–
y
(0 ≤
y
≤ 4) sites. Furthermore, the obtained styrene oxide and aniline spontaneously reacted in the void space of the CSAS, and eventually afforded the 1-phenyl-2-(phenylamino)ethanol product with an excellent conversion (≥99%) and selectivity (85%). A scheme that illustrates the catalytic pathway is shown in Fig.
3c
. In the first step, nitrobenzene and styrene diffuse to the Fe
1
-rich N-doped carbon shell, during which the epoxidation of styrene takes place to yield styrene oxide and leave the nitrobenzene inert. Nitrobenzene sequentially permeates through the internal void and is catalysed by the Pd
1
-rich yolk to yield aniline. Once aniline is formed on isolated Pd
1
sites, it spontaneously condenses with styrene oxide to yield the target product via a ring-opening reaction. This unique 3D nanostructure effectively modulates the spatial distribution of the separated Pd
1
and Fe
1
sites in one yolk–shell nanoconfiguration, specifically for the simultaneous activation of molecular oxygen and hydrogen without compromising each other in the catalytic cycles.

In a further exploration, an integrated catalytic system device was designed and fabricated by integrating an overall water-splitting set-up and the yolk–shell Pd
1
@Fe
1
. The water electrolyser was utilized to supply H
2
and O
2
for the direct synthesis of the amino alcohol (1-phenyl-2-(phenylamino)ethanol) (Fig.
4a
). An atomically dispersed Fe-embedded carbon nanotube sponge (Fe-CNTS, the synthesis and characterization are provided in Supplementary Figs.
23
–
25
) could act as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting to generate H
2
and O
2
. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
26a,b
, the electrolyser based on the Fe-embedded carbon nanotube sponge only needs a bias voltage of 1.65 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm
−2
, which may be ascribed to the stable graphitized porous carbon and atomically dispersed Fe species (Supplementary Figs.
27
–
30
and Supplementary Note
1
). In the electrochemical process, O
2
and H
2
could be generated on-site in a small-scale production under ambient conditions, and consumed in real time for the organic synthesis reactions, which substantially lowers the potential risk of explosion. As displayed in Fig.
4b
, the produced H

and O

flowed into the right container through the middle gas-guide tube. Then, the O

were tested in the homemade device (Supplementary Fig.
38
). Note that these materials delivered different products with a high conversion (≥99%) in 60 minutes (Supplementary Table
4
). Specially, phenylethane and aniline were the main products for yolk–shell Pd
1
@CN, which indicates that the single Pd sites promote hydrogenation for both styrene and nitrobenzene. The Pd-free yolk–shell CN@Fe
1
shows an efficient epoxidation of styrene (≥99%) and negligible activity towards nitrobenzene. This conforms to the remarkable styrene epoxidation activity, which stems from the single Fe sites rather than the single Pd sites. An 83% chemoselectivity and 90.7% yield of 1-phenyl-2-(phenylamino)ethanol was obtained only by yolk–shell Pd
1
@Fe
1
. Phenylethane was rarely detected among the resulting products, which can be attributed to the unique yolk–shell structure. The outside Fe sites in yolk–shell Pd
1
@Fe
1
catalyse styrene to styrene oxide, which greatly hinders the contact between styrene and the inner Pd sites, and thus avoids the formation of phenylethane. On the whole, the unique spatial structure, the kind of metal sites and the distributive sequence of metal sites are vital to control the selectivity of products in this reaction system. For example, the void-free core–shell Pd

@Fe
1
(21%), yolk–shell Fe
1
@Pd
1
(4.9%) and hollow Pd
1
&Fe
1
(28%) exhibit weak chemoselectivity for 1-phenyl-2-(phenylamino)ethanol, which indicates that the void and distributive sequence of the Pd and Fe sites can synergistically accelerate the subsequent epoxide ring-opening amination reaction of intermediate products. Hollow Pd
1
@Fe
1
with an analogous yolk–shell structure also delivered a 65% yield and 46.4% selectivity in 60 minutes. The Pd sites were almost shielded by the SiO
2
layer in the Pd
1
@SiO
2
@Fe
1
, which resulted in a ≥99% yield of styrene oxide. In the absence of catalyst, a blank experiment showed poor activity, which further suggests that the catalytic performance is strongly dependent on the atomic metal sites. Next, we conducted a continuous recycling test to verify the stability of yolk–shell Pd
1
@Fe
1
. As shown in Fig.
4e
, no obvious change in specific productivity and selectivity was observed throughout a reaction of ten hours. After switching off the electrocatalytic water-splitting set-up, the prestored H
2
and O
2
in the balloon could still perform the reaction for three hours without reducing the reaction kinetics and selectivity, which avoids energy waste. In addition, a hot filtration test after 30 minutes of reaction revealed no further conversion after the removal of the yolk–shell Pd
1
@Fe
1
, which certifies the heterogeneous nature of the catalyst (Supplementary Fig.
39a
)
41
,
42
. Also, no leaching of either Pd or Fe was detected in this case (Supplementary Fig.
39b
), which may be assigned to a strong M
1
–C and/or M
1
–N (M = Pd or Fe) coordination contribution (Supplementary Fig.
40
). Additionally, the yolk–shell Pd
1
@Fe
1
catalyst could be easily recycled by centrifugation from the solution and reused at least ten times without distinct loss of conversion and selectivity (Supplementary Fig.
41a
). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis of the recycled sample revealed that the yolk–shell morphology and isolated Pd
1
and Fe
1
sites were maintained to a large extent after the durability test (Supplementary Fig.
41b–d
). Furthermore, the Fourier transform EXAFS spectra (Supplementary Fig.

catalyst. The traditional synthesis strategy for the preparation of amino alcohols usually requires multiple homogeneous catalytic reactions and repetitive purification processes in different reaction systems (Supplementary Fig.
43a
). In this work, the as-designed CSAS can directly produce the target amino alcohol (Supplementary Fig.

) in one system with a rational atomic design.

Substrate scope
Having established the highly active and selective catalytic system, we then expanded the substrate scope to nitrobenzene derivatives to synthesize the corresponding amino alcohol. As shown in Fig.
5a
, a broad range of nitrobenzene derivatives, which includes 1-nitro-4-chlorobenzene and 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene, was tested in our CSAS. Remarkably, we could acquire the target amino alcohol in 78.5 and 72% yields, respectively. Further, cyclohexene reacted with various nitrobenzene derivatives to produce the corresponding amino alcohol (the third row in Fig.
5
) in 78 and 86.3% yields, respectively. Note that ethylene, an important industrial building block molecule, could also be catalysed in our system, with an excellent yield of 84.1% for 2-(phenylamino)ethanol. To prove the utility, S-containing substrates were further explored. Diphenyl disulfide and its derivatives (−R
3
= Me, OMe, Ph, Br and Cl) delivered yields between 58.5 and 81.8% for the final coupling products (Fig.
5b
), which further verifies the system’s practicality.

Conclusions
In summary, we report a biomimetic construction of CSAS with two different single metal sites, Fe
1
sites in a N-doped carbon shell and Pd
1
sites in a MOF-derived yolk, to simultaneously catalyse nitroaromatics hydrogenation and alkene epoxidation reactions, which leads to a cascade synthesis of amino alcohols. Our findings provide an enabling and versatile strategy to integrate single-atom catalysts within one system, which is critically important for the continuous and multistep synthesis of compounds from easily accessible building block molecules for various challenging reactions.

(24 mg)) was loaded into the reactor. The reactor was sealed and linked with a conduit to combine with the water-splitting electrolytic cell. Then, the reactor was heated to 80 °C and stirring with a speed fixed at 450 r.p.m. to ensure the diffusion effect was eliminated. Mesitylene (1 mmol), used as the internal standard, was added at the beginning of the reaction with stirring at 80 °C in an oil bath. The product was identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TXQ Quantum XLS, column TG-WAXMS, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quantitatively analysed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-2010 Plus equipped with a flame ionization detector) and a 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm KB-WAX capillary column (Kromat Corporation) using mesitylene as an internal standard. The selectivity and yield were calculated using equations (

) and (

), respectively:
$$\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{Selectivity}}\,{(\%)} =\\ \frac{{{\mathrm{produced}}\,{\mathrm{1}} {\hbox{-}} {\mathrm{phenyl}} {\hbox{-}} 2 {\hbox{-}} ({\mathrm{phenylamino}}){\mathrm{ethanol}}\,({\mathrm{mmol}})}}{{{\mathrm{1}} {\hbox{-}} {\mathrm{phenyl}} {\hbox{-}} 2 {\hbox{-}} ({\mathrm{phenylamino}}){\mathrm{ethanol}}\,({\mathrm{mmol}})\,+ \,{\mathrm{aniline}}({\mathrm{mmol}}) \,+ \,{\mathrm{phenylethane}}\,({\mathrm{mmol}}) \,+ \,{\mathrm{styrene}}\,{\mathrm{oxide}}\,({\mathrm{mmol}})}}\\ \times 100\end{array}$$

To generate the results of specific productivity shown in Fig.
4e
, for each cycle the system was reacted at 80 °C for 1 h. When the reaction time reached 1 h, 50 μl of the solution was extracted with a miniature syringe from the glass electrolytic cell and analysed by gas chromatography. Meanwhile, we reinjected the system quickly with new reactants (nitrobenzene (0.2 mmol) and styrene (0.2 mmol)) to let the system start the next cycle for another hour. A total of 13 cycles were conducted, and the yields of each cycle were recorded by gas chromatography. We could calculate the yields of each cycle test by the same method as above and the specific productivity was calculated using equation (

):
$$\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{Specific}}\,{\mathrm{productivity}}\left( {{\mathrm{mmol}} \, {\mathrm{ml}}^{ - {\mathrm{1}}} \, {\mathrm{h}}^{ - {\mathrm{1}}}} \right)\\ = \frac{{{\mathrm{produced}}\,{\mathrm{1}} {\hbox{-}} {\mathrm{phenyl}} {\hbox{-}} 2 {\hbox{-}} ({\mathrm{phenylamino}}){\mathrm{ethanol}}\,({\mathrm{mmol}})}}{{{\mathrm{volume}}\,{\mathrm{of}}\,{\mathrm{the}}\,{\mathrm{solvent}}\,({\mathrm{ml}})\ \times\ {\mathrm{reaction}}\,{\mathrm{time}} \ ({\mathrm{h}})}}\end{array}$$

Characterization
XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku Miniflex-600 operated at 40 kV voltage and 15 mA current using a Cu Kα radiation (
λ
= 0.15406 nm). The step size was 0.02° and the scanning speed was 8° min
−1
. TEM images were recorded on a Hitachi-7650 worked at 100 kV. The high-resolution TEM and HAADF-STEM images, and the corresponding electron energy-loss spectroscopy, were recorded on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin high-resolution transmission electron microscope worked at 200 kV and a JEOL JEM-ARM200F TEM/STEM with a spherical aberration corrector worked at 300 kV. Through-focal HAADF series were acquired at nanometre intervals, with the first image underfocused (beyond the beam exit surface) and the final image overfocused (before the beam entrance surface). The images were then manually aligned to remove the sample drift effects. Elemental analysis of Pd in the solid samples was detected by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (Optima 7300 DV). For the hard XAFS measurement and data analysis, XAFS spectra at the Pd and Fe K-edges were recorded at the XAS station (BL14W1) of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The Pd and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure data were recorded in the fluorescence mode. The storage ring worked at an energy of 3.5 GeV. The hard X-ray was monochromatized with Si(111) double crystals. The acquired EXAFS data were extracted and processed according to standard procedures using the ATHENA module implemented in IFEFFIT software packages. The k
3
-weighted EXAFS spectra were obtained by subtracting the postedge background from the overall absorption and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step. Subsequently, k
3
-weighted
χ
(k) data in the k-space were Fourier transformed to real (
R
) space using a Hanning windows (
d
K
= 3.00–12.173 Å
−1
) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. To obtain the quantitative structural parameters around the central atoms, least-squares curve parameter fitting was performed using the ARTEMIS module of IFEFFIT software packages. The following EXAFS equation was used:
$$\chi \left( k \right) = \mathop {\sum}\limits_j {\frac{{N_jS_o^2F_j\left( k \right)}}{{kR_j^2}}} \exp \left( { - 2k^2\sigma _j^2} \right)\exp \left[ {\frac{{ - 2R_j}}{{\lambda \left( k \right)}}} \right]\sin [2kR_j + \phi _j\left( k \right)]$$
