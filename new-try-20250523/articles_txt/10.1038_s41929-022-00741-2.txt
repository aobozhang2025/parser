Abstract
Understanding the structural dynamics of a catalyst under reaction conditions is challenging but crucial regarding catalyst design. Here, by a combination of in situ/operando characterization and first-principles modelling, we show that supported rhodium (Rh) catalysts undergo restructuring at the atomic scale in response to carbon monoxide (CO), a gaseous product formed during steam reforming of methane. Despite transformation of the initially prepared single-Rh-cation catalyst into Rh nanoparticles during hydrogen pretreatment, the formed Rh nanoparticles redispersed to low-nuclearity, CO-liganded Rh clusters (Rh

(
m
= 1–3,
n
= 2–4)) under catalytic conditions. Theoretical simulations under reaction conditions suggest that the pressure of the CO product stabilizes Rh

n
sites, while in situ/operando spectroscopy revealed a reversible restructuring between Rh

(CO)
3
clusters and CO-ligand-free Rh clusters driven by CO pressure. Our findings demonstrate the importance of including product molecules in the atomic-scale understanding of catalytic active sites and mechanisms.

Main
Heterogeneous catalysts, commonly formed by nanoparticles of active metals deposited on a high-surface-area support, are of central importance for chemical production and energy transformation. Controlling the structure of the active sites of a heterogeneous catalyst is critical to maintaining its activity
1
,
2
. The surface composition and morphology of a catalyst can be strongly affected by the reaction environment, such as change in the reducing or oxidizing capability of a reactant gas, or of the temperature
3
,
4
,
5
. At high temperatures, oxide-supported metal nanoparticles (NPs) can sinter
6
,
7
and even the oxide support can undergo phase transition
8
. At the atomic scale, a catalytic reaction event typically occurs on a specific site, consisting of one or more atoms of the metal particle and potentially involving atoms of the support at the metal particle’s periphery, at a given temperature in the gaseous environment. To optimize the use of precious metals, considerable efforts have been made recently to create highly dispersed supported catalysts, in the form of small clusters
1
. Downsizing to the single-atom extreme has largely benefited structurally insensitive catalytic reactions that occur on large metal particles;
1
,
2
,
9
,
10
however, these catalysts can be strongly susceptible to sintering during reaction
11
. Therefore, understanding the structural dynamics of a highly dispersed supported catalyst under a specific catalytic environment, and determining the factors that maintain high dispersion, are crucial to the rational design of efficient and robust heterogeneous catalysts.
Here we report the evolution of the coordination and chemical environments of initially prepared, singly dispersed rhodium (Rh) atoms anchored on CeO
2
(Rh
1
/CeO
2
), driven first by the reduction pretreatment step of the catalyst and then by the catalytic conditions, to demonstrate the predominant impact of the partial pressure of a product gas on the formation and preservation of highly dispersed Rh
m
(
m
= 1–3) cluster active sites during catalysis. We find that although freshly prepared Rh
1
single atoms anchored on CeO
2
(Rh
1
/CeO
2
) transform into Rh NP/CeO
2
after H
2
reduction pretreatment, the carbon monoxide (CO) generated by the steam reforming of methane (SRM) reaction (
\({\mathrm{{CH}_{4} + {H}_{2}{O} \to CO + {3H}_{2}}}\)
) breaks down Rh NPs into highly dispersed, subnanometer, CO-liganded Rh sites (Rh
m
(CO)
n
(
m
= 1–3,
n
= 2–4)). The restructuring of this catalyst is uncovered by a combination of in situ/operando studies and first-principles modelling, addressing the hidden evolution of catalytic sites at the atomic scale driven by the pressure of product gases.
Results
Structural evolution of the Rh/CeO
2
catalyst
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction studies confirmed crystallization of CeO
2
in the as-synthesized 0.17 wt% Rh/CeO
2
catalyst (Supplementary Figs.
1
and
2
) The studies show that neither metallic Rh nor Rh
2
O
3
NPs formed in the as-synthesized catalyst. Coordination and chemical environments of Rh atoms of the as-synthesized catalyst were examined by X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), ambient-pressure X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The energy position of the Rh K-edge of the as-synthesized catalyst in XANES (black line in Supplementary Fig.
3a
) resembles that of the Rh
2
O
3
reference (blue line in Supplementary Fig.
3a
), suggesting that the Rh atoms of the as-synthesized catalyst are cationic. The Fourier-transformed
r
-space EXAFS spectrum at the Rh K-edge for the as-synthesized catalyst indicates that Rh atoms are singly dispersed (Fig.
1a
). There is only one major peak, at 2.03 Å, observed in the range 0–4 Å. All distances or bond lengths in this Article are values after phase correction of EXAFS. On average, 6.73 ± 0.4 oxygen atoms in the first coordination shell of a Rh atom contributed to the peak at 2.03 Å (Supplementary Table
1
). The black dashed line in Fig.
1a
marks the distance between two Rh atoms in the second shell (Rh-(O)-Rh) of Rh
2
O
3
(2.87 Å). The absence of a second shell of Rh atoms in Fig.
1a
further demonstrates the absence of Rh
2
O
3
NPs in the as-synthesized catalyst. Hence, the
r
-space spectrum of Rh K-edge of the as-synthesized catalyst suggests that Rh atoms are singly dispersed Rh cations. The high Rh-O coordination number indicates that Rh
1
cations are substituted for Ce cations in the surface lattice of CeO
2
. The single-atomic dispersion of Rh
1
cations is further supported by DRIFTS with CO as a chemical probe. The observed peaks at 2,085 and 2,017 cm
−1
(Supplementary Fig.
4
) are assigned to symmetric and asymmetric vibration of geminal Rh
1
(CO)
2
, respectively
12
,
13
. The lack of bridge-adsorbed CO in the window 1,850–1,900 cm
−1
excludes the existence of Rh-Rh metallic bonds, in line with the formation of singly dispersed Rh
1
cations
14
,
15
,
16
. Thus, in the following section, both 0.17 wt% Rh/CeO
2
and Rh
1
/CeO
2
will be interchangeably used to denote the as-synthesized catalyst.

During pretreatment, Rh
1
/CeO
2
was treated in 5% H
2
at 500 °C. The surface chemistry of this catalyst during this pretreatment was tracked with AP-XPS (Fig.
2a,b
). The deconvolutions of Ce 3d and O 1s spectra are described in Supplementary Notes
2
and
3
. Observation of the peak at 532.0 eV in the O 1s spectrum assigned to the O* atom of H′-O*-Ce
3+
-O (Fig.

) implies that Rh atoms catalyse the dissociation of molecular H

to atomic H′ (′: guest), which reduces Ce

catalyst under H
2
pretreatment and catalytic conditions is reduced.

Reduction of the catalyst by H
2
markedly changed the coordination environment of Rh atoms in Rh
1
/CeO
2
. Following reduction, a new peak at 2.66 Å formed in the Fourier-transformed
k
2
-weighted
r
-space EXAFS spectrum while the Rh-O peak at 2.05 Å weakened. This new peak was assigned to Rh-Rh metal bonds (Fig.
1b
; see also XANES spectra in Supplementary Fig.
5b
). On average, 5.7 ± 0.7 Rh atoms in the first shell of a Rh atom contributed to the peak at 2.66 Å (Supplementary Table
1
). The approximate size of these Rh NPs is 1.0 nm, based on the reported dependence of average Rh-Rh coordination number on the size of a Rh NP
17
.
After H
2
reduction, the Rh NP/CeO
2
catalyst again markedly restructured under SRM conditions at 500 °C in a feed stream of a mixture of 2.5 ml min
–1
CH
4
and 22.5 ml min
–1
He, bubbled through water at 25 °C. The catalytic performance of the Rh
1
/CeO
2
catalyst is shown in Supplementary Fig.
6
. Compared to the
r
-space spectrum of Rh NPs formed by H
2
reduction (Fig.
1b
), the spectrum seen during catalysis exhibited distinctly different features (Fig.
1c
; see also Supplementary Fig.
7
for Rh and Rh
2
O
3
reference spectra). This spectrum consisted of a primary peak at 2.04 Å assigned to Rh-O bonds and a relatively weak peak at 2.57 Å assigned to Rh-Rh bonds (Supplementary Table
1
). Compared to the spectrum under reduction conditions (Fig.
1b
), the intensity of the peak of Rh-Rh bonds during catalysis (Fig.
1c
) was largely weakened while that of the Rh-O peak was simultaneously increased. The coordination numbers (CN) of Rh to Rh (CN(Rh-Rh)) and those of O to Rh (CN(Rh-O)) under the catalytic environment were 1.4 and 5.3, respectively (Supplementary Table
1
). The ratio of CN(Rh-Rh) to CN(O-Rh), 1.4/5.3, during catalysis at 500 ˚C, is only 0.04 of the ratio (5.7/0.87) of the catalyst under 5% H
2
at 500 °C. The distinct differences between CN(Rh-Rh) and CN(O-Rh) show that Rh NPs formed under H
2
reduction are redistributed in the catalytic environment. Notably, the average CN(Rh-Rh) during catalysis at 500 °C was 1.4 (Supplementary Table
1
), suggesting the formation of Rh
2
dimers whose CN(Rh-Rh) is 1.0 and/or Rh
3
triangular clusters whose CN(Rh-Rh) is 2.0. The pronounced change in Rh atoms coordination environment following switching from reduction to catalysis conditions is supported by the wavelet transformation of the EXAFS Rh K-edge spectra (WT–EXAFS) of the catalyst. For the reduced catalyst (Supplementary Fig.
8a
), a major maximum in the WT–EXAFS plot was found at R = 2.30 Å (distance before phase correction), which is assigned to the metallic Rh-Rh coordination of Rh metal NPs based on the reference sample of a metallic Rh foil (Supplementary Fig.
8d
). However, the maximum in the WT–EXAFS plot of the catalyst during catalysis (Supplementary Fig.
8b
) was different from that of either the Rh-O coordination in Rh
2
O
3
NPs (Supplementary Fig.
8c
) or Rh-Rh coordination of Rh metal NPs (Supplementary Fig.
8a
), suggesting that the coordination environment of Rh during catalysis is different from either Rh
2
O
3
or Rh metal NPs. Clearly, the chemical and coordination environments of Rh atoms indicate a second restructuring, in which the Rh NPs redisperse into smaller Rh clusters that represent the steady-state active sites of the catalyst.
Along with the redispersion of 1.0 nm of Rh NPs to Rh
2
dimer/Rh
3
trimer structures under catalytic conditions, the surface chemistry of the CeO
2
support of this catalyst also underwent an obvious change, with the formation of surface hydroxyl groups and reduction of surface Ce
4+
cations. During catalysis (
\(P_{\mathrm{{CH}_{4}}}\)
= 0.5 Torr and
\(P_{\mathrm{{{H}_{2}{O}}}}\)
= 1.0 Torr), a peak at ~531 eV was seen after deconvolution in the O 1s XPS spectrum (blue peak in Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Table
2
), assigned to surface OH groups, while the blue peak was absent under reduction at 500 °C (Fig.
2b
). Such H′O′-Ce
3+
-O hydroxyl groups (blue peak in Fig.
2d
) are readily formed through dissociation of reactant H
2
O in the environment of the SRM reaction. This is consistent with our thermodynamics calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), which suggest that CeO
2
(111) is hydroxylated during catalysis and that the topmost Ce
4+
cations of the CeO
2
surface are reduced to Ce
3+
under the realistic H
2
and H
2
O pressures undergone by the catalyst during steady-state SRM at 500 °C (Fig.
3
). CeO
2
(111) was chosen as the facet to build the structural models for computational studies because the (111) facet is the main surface exposed on CeO
2
NPs (Supplementary Fig.
1b
). The insensitivity of the predicted surface structure to the choice of the effective Hubbard
U
value (
U
eff
), as well as DFT-based spectroscopic calculations, further support the presence of surface hydroxyls on the CeO
2
support under catalytic conditions (Supplementary Note

and Supplementary Figs.

25
).

Understanding active site stabilization at the atomic scale
The experimentally observed structural evolution at the atomic scale of Rh-based catalytic sites during catalysis is explained by our atomistic modelling. Using DFT calculations we computed the structures of Rh
1
, Rh
2
and Rh
3
active sites, with H, OH and CO as potential ligands generated during catalysis. We considered a large number of liganded cluster structures (>500) on the hydroxylated CeO
2
(111) surface, including structures with an O vacancy surrounding the Rh site; we found the formation of such an O vacancy to be exergonic in the presence of Rh. By holding the chemical potentials of H
2
and H
2
O constant, the influences of CO pressure (
P
CO
) and temperature on the structure and composition of clusters were explored through atomistic thermodynamics (Fig.
4
).

Under steady-state catalytic conditions at 500 °C (Fig.
4a
) we found that ensembles of distinct CO-liganded Rh clusters were generated, including low-energy metastable examples (Fig.
5
and Supplementary Note
12
)
18
. Rh
3
(CO)
3
is the most stable, and hence most probable, cluster based on our calculations of Gibbs free energy of formation (∆
G
form
). In the ensemble of Rh active site structures, Rh
3
(CO)
3
sites are more stable than either Rh
2
(CO)
3
or Rh
1
(CO)
2
(Fig.
5
) and thus Rh trimers probably comprise the majority of active sites. Consistent with the reaction-driven redispersion of Rh NPs uncovered experimentally, thermodynamic calculations suggest that small Rh
2
/Rh
3
clusters can be stabilized by interaction with CO, a product of SRM. When comparing the stability of these small trimers to larger Rh NPs, we found that the SRM reaction condition at 500 °C (marked with a green cursor) lies next to the phase boundary between the stability domain of Rh NPs and CO-liganded Rh sites, Rh
m
(CO)
n
(Fig.
4b

Although our thermodynamic analyses identified that reaction-generated CO is crucial for the stabilization of small Rh clusters, the influence of CeO
2
support cannot be understated. Numerous studies have shown that the nature of the catalyst support surface in a reactive environment strongly affects the structure of supported metal atoms and NPs
16
,
19
,
20
,
21
. To assess the role of the support, we calculated the reaction internal energy required to form Rh
3
(CO)
3
from a free Rh
3
cluster and three CO molecules on one hydroxylated surface containing 5.09 OH nm
–2
without O
vac
(region 1B in Fig.
3a
; also Supplementary Fig.
27a
), and one containing 5.09 OH nm
–2
with 0.85 O
vac
nm
–2
(Supplementary Fig.
27b
). Reaction energies required for the formation of Rh
3
(CO)
3
were found to be –10.58 and –10.90 eV, respectively. This difference suggests that the presence of an O vacancy renders the reaction energy for the formation of Rh
3
(CO)
3
slightly more favourable, by 0.11 eV Rh
–1
. We further compared the interaction energy between the Rh
3
(CO)
3
cluster and the support CeO
2
(111) surface (Supplementary Fig.
27c
), which was found to be –8.03 eV, to the interaction energy between the Rh
3
(CO)
3
cluster and the support CeO
2
(111) surface with an O vacancy in the vicinity of Rh
3
(CO)
3
(Supplementary Fig.
27d
), which was found to be –6.63 eV. These interaction energies were calculated by detaching the cluster from the surface with no structural relaxation of the obtained fragments. The existence of an O vacancy in contrast, therefore, had weakened the interaction energy by 0.47 eV Rh
–1
atom, but allowed the cluster and surrounding support atoms to adopt a less deformed, intrinsically more stable, configuration. As a net result, the oxygen vacancies of CeO
2
surface can cooperate with CO ligands to slightly stabilize the formation of small Rh
3
(CO)
3
clusters.
Pressure-dependent formation of Rh
m
(CO)
n
clusters
The formation of Rh
m
(CO)
n
clusters was also observed in two operando DRIFTS experiments (Fig.
6b
and Supplementary Fig.
9b
). Figure
6b
includes three series of experiments. In series 1 (Fig.
6b
), a pulse of CH
4
was added to flowing Ar carrying water vapour while the prereduced catalyst was held at 500 °C in the mixture of Ar and water vapour. During the pulse, the feed stream consisted of ~1% CH
4
and ~3% H
2
O. The CO produced from the steam reforming of CH
4
, in terms of the reaction between the CH
4
pulse and flowing H
2
O vapour, formed Rh
3
(CO)
3
. In the first 60 s after introduction of the CH
4
pulse to the DRIFTS cell, there were no vibrational features in the region 2,050–1,900 cm
−1
because the SRM had just started to produce CO (Supplementary Fig.
9b
). Vibrational features at 2,012 and 1,930 cm
−1
in the region 2,050–1,900 cm
−1
were promptly observed 2 min after the pulse, showing the formation of Rh
m
(CO)
n
species (Fig.
6b
and Supplementary Fig.
9b
). These observed vibrational features are in good agreement with the two highest CO stretching frequencies, at 1,982 and 1,939 cm
−1
, for Rh
3
(CO)
3
calculated by DFT (Supplementary Fig.
28
). Because no external source of CO was introduced to the operando DRIFTS experiment (Fig.
6b
and Supplementary Fig.
9b
), the formation of Rh
m
(CO)
n
must have been driven by the CO product from SRM at 500 °C.

, DRIFTS spectra at 500 °C under SRM catalytic condition (b1–9) and under other conditions (b10–20). Series 1: b1–9, a transient pulse of CH

reactant (equivalent to 0.1 ml CH

, at 25 °C, 1 atm) composed of 1% CH

and 99% Ar, was introduced to the catalyst by mixing the pulse with flowing water vapour formed by flowing Ar (99.999%) through water at 25 °C. No external CO source was introduced before and during series 1. Series 2: b10–14, spectra in a flow of CO (1%) balanced with Ar. Series 3: spectra (b15–20) being purged with Ar as a function of time. The background spectrum for the DRIFTS study was collected on the catalyst surface under Ar and water vapour flow at 500 °C. In series 1, 20 ml min

water vapour containing 3% vapour was continuously flowed through the reaction cell; CH

to be reversible. a.u., arbitrary units.

Thermodynamic stability calculations of the Rh active site show that its ligand structure is sensitive to CO chemical potential. Starting from the steady-state catalytic environment (Fig.
4a,b
) with Rh
3
(CO)
3
as the most stable species (Fig.
4e
), two ligand-restructuring events (labelled 1 and 2 and marked with arrows in Fig.
4a
) may occur when
P
CO
is decreased while the temperature is held constant at 500 °C. In these two events at 500 °C, the active site loses CO ligands. In event 1, one CO ligand is lost when
P
CO
falls <10
−3
bar, forming Rh
3
(CO)
2
(Fig.
4d
). Event 2 occurs when
P
CO
falls <10
−5
bar, where the Rh
3
(CO)
2
site loses its remaining CO ligands to form the Rh
3
H
1
site (Fig.
4c
). If the pressure of CO is increased starting from steady-state condition, one additional CO is predicted to attach to the Rh
3
(CO)
3
site when
P
CO
rises >10
−1
bar, forming the Rh
3
(CO)
4
site (Fig.
4f
). Importantly, both the Rh
3
(CO)
2
and Rh
3
H
1
sites are metastable compared to the Rh NP, while Rh
3
(CO)
3
and Rh
3
(CO)
4
are similarly stable (Fig.
4b
). This difference among thermodynamic stabilities in Fig.
4a
underlines the key role of CO in the stability of the Rh active site. The predicted
P
CO
-dependent restructuring is consistent with a theoretically predicted decreasing trend in the frequency of the principal CO stretching mode, in the order of Rh

> Rh

3
(CO)
2
(Supplementary Note
13
and Supplementary Fig.
28
).
The predicted
P
CO
-dependent restructuring of the catalytic sites at 500 °C was also experimentally observed by operando DRIFTS studies, where CO was produced by the reaction between flowing H
2
O vapour and pulsed CH
4
at 500 °C. In series 1 of Fig.
6b
, CH
4
was provided through a pulse only and thus no further CO was continuously produced after the pulse. Since water vapour was continuously flowed through the catalyst, the partial pressure of CO (and the chemical potential of CO) around the catalyst progressively decreased. Time-dependent vibrational signatures show that the Rh
3
(CO)
3
clusters progressively restructured to CO-ligand-free Rh clusters, as illustrated in Fig.
6a
(series 1). The transformation of Rh
3
(CO)
3
to a CO-ligand-free Rh cluster was evidenced by the evolution of the CO vibrational feature. The CO stretching frequencies of Rh
3
(CO)
3
obviously shifted to lower values, and their intensities decreased corresponding to decreased CO pressure (Fig.
6b
), as denoted by the red arrows in Fig.
6b
(Supplementary Fig.
9
).
The key role of CO in maintaining the highly dispersed Rh
3
(CO)
3
catalytic sites was further confirmed by reversible restructuring of the Rh site observed in two additional series of experiments shown in Fig.
6b
. Following the disappearance of
ν
(CO) peaks in the range 2,050–1,850 cm
−1
at 500 °C (Fig.
6b
), CO-ligand-free Rh clusters formed at the end of series 1. Once CO was introduced to the catalyst as a steady flow (at the 31st minute, 1% CO), CO-ligand-free Rh clusters immediately restructured to Rh
3
(CO)
3
(spectrum b10 in series 2 of Fig.
6b
). This restructuring was evidenced by the immediate reappearance of
v
(CO) peaks at 2,010 and 1,920 cm
−1
in series 2 (Fig.
6b
). The structure thus produced underwent almost no change providing that CO was continuously flowed through the catalyst (Fig.
6b
). Notably, these CO vibrational frequencies are distinct from chemisorbed CO on the (100) or (111) surfaces of Rh metal
22
. At the end of series 2 (the 21st minute of series 2 in Fig.
6b
), flowing CO was replaced with flowing He; the progressive decrease in CO concentration in series 3 resulted in the restructuring of Rh
3
(CO)
3
to CO-ligand-free Rh clusters. Series 1 (under non-steady-state catalytic condition) and series 3 (under the same temperature and
P
CO
as DFT modelling) exhibited the same evolution of CO vibrational features, suggesting that
P
CO
is the main driving force regardless of CO produced from CH
4
reforming or from the external environment. Overall, the formation and restructuring of the active sites, Rh
3
(CO)
n
can be reversed by changing the chemical potential of CO surrounding the catalytic site.
In conclusion, this work demonstrated that evolution of the structure of Rh nanoclusters supported on CeO
2
is dependent on the partial pressure of product CO in the gas environment to which the catalyst is subjected. Beyond the Rh/CeO
2
catalyst studied in our work, the restructuring capability of CO on metal model catalysts has been shown in systems where CO was a reactant
3
,
4
,
5
,
23
. CO has been found to induce the restructuring of stepped Pt surfaces to CO-covered Pt clusters with a size of 2.1–2.2 nm
4
. For Cu, a metal with weaker cohesive energy than Pt, CO can even fragment the close-packed Cu(111) surface into nanometre-sized, CO-covered clusters that can activate H
2
O
23
. In our system, singly dispersed Rh cations in the as-prepared catalyst were transformed to Rh NPs after reduction by H
2
but CO, a product formed from SRM, can redisperse Rh atoms of Rh NPs into catalytically active CO-liganded Rh
3
clusters during catalysis. As evidenced by first-principles atomistic thermodynamic calculations and in situ/operando spectroscopy, the CO product gas produced by the SRM plays a crucial role in induction and maintenance of the highly dispersed active sites, Rh
3
(CO)
n
of this Rh/CeO
2
catalyst. This work demonstrates the necessity of including product molecules as a factor in identifying active sites under catalytic conditions.
Methods
Catalyst synthesis
CeO
2
nanorods were synthesized by a hydrothermal method as reported previously
24
,
25
,
26
. In a typical synthesis, 1.736 g of Ce(NO
3
)
3
·6H
2
O (Aldrich, 99.99%) was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water then added dropwise to a concentrated NaOH solution, forming a mixed solution of Ce(NO
3
)
3
. The concentrated NaOH solution was prepared by dissolving 19.2 g of NaOH (Aldrich, >98%) in 70 ml of deionized water. Then, the mixed solution of Ce(NO
3
)
3
was maintained under vigorous stirring for 30 min before being transferred to a Teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 24 h. Following hydrothermal synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The yellow powder thus obtained was washed with deionized water until its pH became neutral. Finally, the powder was dried at 60 °C in air for 10 h. This sample of CeO
2
nanorod was used as a support in the following preparation of the Rh
1
/CeO
2
catalyst.
The Rh
1
/CeO
2
catalyst was prepared by the deposition–precipitation method
27
. In a typical synthesis, 1.0 g of CeO
2
nanorods was dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred at 400 r.p.m. for 1 h; at this stage it is termed CeO
2
aqueous dispersion. Then, 5.6 mg of Rh (III) nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, ~36% Rh basis), which provided ~2.0 mg of Rh metal, was weighed and dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water. The prepared Rh salt solution was slowly introduced into the prepared CeO
2
aqueous dispersion by syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min
–1
while the aqueous solution was being stirred, creating an aqueous mixture containing both Rh
3+
and CeO
2
nanorods. This aqueous mixture of Rh
3+
and ceria nanorods was continuously stirred for an additional 3 h. The pH of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradual introduction of ammonium hydroxide solution (Aldrich, 28%) while the aqueous mixture was being stirred, followed by continuous stirring for an additional 5 h. The aqueous mixture was then centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, after which the upper layer was decanted. The solid product thus obtained was dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 250 °C for 2 h to obtain the as-synthesized Rh
1
/CeO
2
catalyst. The actual loading of Rh on CeO
2
nanorods of the as-synthesized catalyst was measured by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry, and was found to be 0.17 wt%. Thus, either 0.17 wt% Rh/CeO
2
or Rh
1
/CeO
2
is used interchangeably to denote the as-synthesized catalyst in the following sections.
Catalytic tests
The catalyst (50 mg) was mixed with 300 mg of quartz for SRM. The catalytic performance of the Rh
1
/CeO
2
catalyst was evaluated in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the temperature range 350–600 °C. A K-type thermal couple was inserted into the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature, which was controlled by a proportional integral derivative controller. The catalyst was pretreated in H
2
(5% in Ar, 20 ml min
–1
) at 500 °C for 1 h before catalysis. Water was introduced by syringe pump, in the form of vapour formed in a vaporization chamber held at 120 °C, before entering the reactor. Water vapour flow rate was kept at twice that of CH
4
(10% in Ar, 20 ml min
–1
), which was premixed with water vapour before being flowed into the reactor. To ensure that water vapour could be fully delivered to the catalyst bed, all stainless steel tubing and valves between the vaporization chamber and reactor were heated and maintained at 120 °C during evaluation of catalytic performance. The products were analysed by an online gas chromatograph equipped with a Hayasep-D column and thermal conductivity detector. The conversion of CH
4
and yield to H
2
was evaluated as follows, with
\([{{\mathrm{CH}}}_{4}]_{{\mathrm{in}}}\)
,
\([{{\mathrm{CH}}}_{4}]_{{\mathrm{out}}}\)
and
\([{{\mathrm{H}}}_{2}]_{{\mathrm{out}}}\)
representing CH
4
concentration at the reactor inlet and CH
4
and H
2
concentrations at the reactor outlet, respectively.
$${\mathrm{Conversion}}\left( {\rm{CH}_{4}} \right) = \frac{{[{\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{in} - [{\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{out}}}{{[{\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{in}}} \times 100{{{\mathrm{\% }}}}$$
(1)
$${\rm{Yield}}\left( {{\rm{H}_{2}}} \right) = \frac{{\frac{1}{3}[{\rm{H}_{2}}]_{out}}}{{[{\rm{CH}_{4}}]_{in}}} \times 100{{{\mathrm{\% }}}}$$

Catalyst characterization
In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments were mainly performed on beamline BL36XU at SPring-8. The Rh K-edge signal was collected under fluorescence mode by a Ge detector. Data were calibrated, merged and analysed using Athena and Artemis software packages with the standard protocol
28
. For in situ experiments, the catalyst powder was loaded in a capillary quartz tube cell
29
. The gas was then introduced into the cell, with flow rate controlled by mass flow controllers. In terms of reduction, 20 ml min
–1
5% H
2
was introduced to the reactor. In regard to catalysis, the composition of the SRM reactant mixture was CH
4
(2.5 ml min
–1
), He (22.5 ml min
–1
) and water vapour. The cell was heated, then maintained at the desired temperature for 30 min in a flow of 5% H
2
in He for the reduction or in a flow of the reactant mixture for SRM, then the Rh K-edge spectrum was collected in situ in the flowing gas at about 150 °C. For the fitting of Fourier-transformed EXAFS data, CN, distance (Å) and Debye–Waller factor (
σ
2
) were set as variables. WT analysis of EXAFS data was performed with the HAMA Fortran package from the ERSF website. Parameters used in these analyses were the Morlet function,
σ
= 1 and
κ
= 5 (Supplementary Note
1
).
Surface chemistry of the catalyst under reduction and catalysis conditions was tracked with a commercial AP-XPS system
30
. A reaction cell was assembled with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source and an energy analyser with precise geometry. The mixture of reactant gases at Torr pressure, with the ratio of partial pressure of CH
4
and H
2
O vapour at 1:2, was introduced to the reaction cell through a gas manifold maintained at a 120–150 °C for delivery of water vapour to the reaction cell. The partial pressures of CH
4
and H
2
O (vapour) were 0.5 and 1.0 Torr, respectively. The total flow rate of gas mixture entering the in situ reaction cell was ~4 ml min
–1
(ref.
30
). The total pressure of reactant gases in the reaction cell was the average value of those measured by one capacitance gauge located between the gas manifold and tubing to the entrance port of the reaction cell, and by another placed between the exit port tubing of the reaction cell. XPS data were analysed using CasaXPS software. All spectrum peaks were calibrated by the Au 4
f
7/2
peak to 84.0 eV. Ce 3d spectra were deconvoluted into ten components, whereas six peaks at 882.6, 889.0, 898.6, 900.9, 907.7 and 916.9 eV are assigned to v, vʺ, vʹʺ, u, uʺ and uʹʺ of Ce
4+
, respectively while four at 880.6, 885.2, 899.2 and 904.0 eV were assigned to v
o
, vʹ, u
o
and uʹ of Ce
3+
, respectively
31
.
DRIFTS spectra of CO molecules absorbed on the catalyst using guest CO source were collected on a Thermo-Fisher Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer using an MCT/A detector with a spectrum resolution of 4 cm
−1
and integrated with a diffuse reflectance reaction cell (Praying Mantis high-temperature reaction cell) at our collaborators’ laboratories at Fuzhou University (FZU). A home-made gas inlet system, including a six-way valve, was used to perform transient studies. Here, we describe this as an ex situ study to distinguish it from the operando studies described below. The purpose of this ex situ study was to identify the chemical state and dispersion of Rh atoms of the as-synthesized catalyst, 0.17 wt%Rh/CeO
2
. In this ex situ study, the catalyst was mounted in the cell without dilution and was pretreated in a helium flow (99.999%) to remove surface adsorbates before the experiment. Different from these ex situ DRIFTS studies, operando DRIFTS experiments were performed to identify the CO stretching frequency of active sites of the catalyst formed during SRM catalysis and whether these active sites could restructure under different CO partial pressures. The experimental protocol is summarized in Supplementary Note
4
.
The morphology, size and distribution of single atoms of as-prepared 0.17 wt%Rh/CeO
2
samples and samples with different pretreatment or after catalysis were examined with advanced TEM instruments at our collaborators’ laboratories, including FZU (Supplementary Note
5
). In a typical sample preparation, 10 mg of catalyst powder was dispersed in 50 ml of anhydrous ethanol and sonicated for 5 min. Then, 50 μl of the liquid suspension was dropcast on a copper mesh (300-mesh) with carbon nanofilm. Copper mesh and sample were dried overnight before loading on the sample stage for TEM. The morphology and lattice fringes of ceria were then characterized.
DFT calculations
Periodic DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) v.5.4.1 (refs.
32
,
33
,
34
). Exchange correlation energy was calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PDE) functional
35
. Spin polarization was used in all calculations. A dipole correction in the
z
direction was used for surface calculations. The projector-augmented wave method was used to describe core electrons
36
,
37
. Kohn–Sham orbitals were expanded using a set of plane waves with kinetic energy of up to 600 eV. The electronic structure was considered converged when the electronic energy difference between consecutive self-consistent field (SCF) steps fell <10
−6
eV. Surface and molecular structures were considered converged when Hellmann–Feynman forces on atoms fell <0.02 eV Å
–1
. To correct for the self-interaction error of Ce 4
f
electrons, a Hubbard-like on-site repulsion term was added using the approach of Dudarev et al. (DFT +
U
), with an effective Hubbard
U
value (
U
eff
) of 4.5 eV
38
,
39
. Using a parabolic equation of state, the lattice parameter of CeO
2
was found to be 5.502 Å, close to reported values
40
.
In total, (2 × 2), (√7 × √7), (3 × 3), (3 × √7) and (4 × 4) unit cells of CeO
2
(111) containing three O-Ce-O tri-layers were used in the calculations
40
,
41
,
42
. For these periodicities, the Brillouin zone was sampled using (3 × 3 × 1), (3 × 3 × 1), (2 × 2 × 1), (2 × 2 × 1) and (2 × 2 × 1) gamma-point-centred
k
-meshes, respectively
43
. The sensitivity of stable surface structures regarding the choice of
U
eff
was assessed by calculations using a different
U
eff
value (3.67 eV) benchmarked against single-point calculations with the HSE06 hybrid functional
44
,
45
. Single-point HSE06 calculations were performed from converged PBE +
U
(
U
eff
= 4.5 eV) geometries. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a twofold-reduced (VASP commands: NKREDX = 2, NKREDY = 2), gamma-point-centred (2 × 2 × 1) mesh
46
. The (3 × 3) cell was used to simulate Rh active sites. The bottom tri-layer was constrained to bulk positions in structural optimizations.
Vibrational modes were calculated using the finite difference method with a step size of 0.015 Å. Factors of 0.9828 and 1.0086 were multiplied with OH and CO stretching modes, respectively, when comparing calculated vibrational frequencies to experimental values. Core-level shift (CLS) calculations were performed using both the initial state approximation (ISA) and final state approximation (FSA). In the ISA, the vacuum-aligned Rh 3d eigen energies are directly compared to each other. Lowering Rh 3d eigen energy results in a positive CLS. In the FSA, one 3d electron is assumed to be excited by absorption of the incident photon. The core electron binding energy (
E
CL
) is defined as
E
CL
=
E
(N – 1) –
E
(N), where
E
(N – 1) is the energy of the assessed structure after excitation and
E
(N) is that before excitation
47
. The final state CLS is computed by taking the difference between the
E
CL
of the assessed structure and that of a Rh atom in the third layer below the surface of a seven-layer (3 × 3) Rh(111) slab. For reference, according to FSA the CLS of a bulk-like Rh
3+
ion below the Rh
2
O
3
(0001) surface is 0.99 eV.
Modelling the ceria surface and Rh active sites
The most stable CeO
2
(111) surface structure under reaction conditions was determined by minimization of surface free energy under the reaction gas environment (Fig.
3
and Supplementary Fig.
24
)
48
,
49
. The Ce
3+
:Ce
4+
ratio was limited to 1:1 in the two outermost CeO
2
tri-layers, to simulate surface reduction. Surface and subsurface O
vac
and adsorbed H on surface O were included as potential surface motifs. Bulk CeO
2
and gases H
2
and H
2
O were used as Ce, H and O reservoirs, respectively, in calculation of surface free energy (Supplementary Note
6
). Simulated Rh active sites were compared to each other by their Gibbs free energy of formation, normalized by each site’s Rh nuclearity
50
,
51
. For a given Rh site, the hydroxylated CeO
2
(111) surface, H
2
gas, H
2
O gas, CO gas and hypothetical supported Rh
13
clusters were chosen as the Ce, H, O, C and Rh reservoirs, respectively (Supplementary Note
6
).
The thermodynamically controlled assumption of the CeO
2
(111) surface structure was made based on reported experimental observations and reported reaction barriers of elementary redox processes
52
,
53
,
54
. Reduced CeO
2
(111) surfaces in (3 × 3) periodicity were searched based on the following five rules developed from observations in the literature and patterns found for representative surfaces
40
,
41
,
42
,
55
,
56
,
57
,
58
,
59
,
60
,
61
. First, using the
s-xyz-w
notation of Murgida et al.
40
, the most stable O
vac
-containing surfaces should contain minimal
x
+
y
+
z
and
w
. Second, when OH groups and O
vac
coexist, the two prefer to segregate. Third, when multiple vacancies are present, Ce
3+
ions prefer to cluster near a single vacancy. Fourth, Ce
3+
ions prefer to localize near OH groups. Fifth, Ce
3+
ions near an O
vac
prefer to stay out of the O
vac
first coordination shell.
For a given stoichiometry, all structure combinations were first generated without considering the arrangement of Ce
3+
ions, sorted by rules 1 and 2 and optimized without specification of initial magnetic moments. The most stable structures found using this method were selected, and favourable Ce
3+
localization patterns were generated and optimized using rules 3, 4 and 5. In this set of calculations, a set of plane waves with kinetic energy up to 400 eV was used, the Brillouin zone was sampled using only the gamma point, the electronic energy difference between consecutive SCF steps was converged to 10
−5
eV and forces on atoms were converged to <0.05 eV Å
–1
.
The Rh active sites were searched by first computing the ligand-free Rh single-atom or cluster-binding sites on the fully hydroxylated surface, then checking potential CO/H ligand configurations on the stable Rh sites. A small representative set of OH-liganded Rh
1
, Rh
2
and Rh
3
structures were also optimized, but we did not find them to be as stable as CO- or H-liganded Rh single atoms and clusters. In this set of calculations, a set of plane waves with kinetic energy up to 450 eV was used, the electronic energy difference between consecutive SCF steps was converged to 10
−6
eV and forces on atoms were converged to <0.05 eV Å
–1
.
The surface energy or Gibbs free energy of formation of each structure consists of the translational and rotational components of their gas constituents, their vibrational components and that of corresponding surface motifs (Supplementary Note
7
and Supplementary Figs.
10
–
16
). For supported Rh sites, the configurational entropy of Rh (Supplementary Note
8
and Supplementary Fig.
17
), the chemical potential of Rh atoms (Supplementary Note
9
and Supplementary Figs.
18
and
19
) and a back-bonding-based penalty for the adsorption energy of CO (Supplementary Note
10
and Supplementary Figs.
20
and
21
) were also included.
Vibrational contributions to Gibbs free energy were computed in two ways (Supplementary Note
7
). In the screening of CeO
2
surface structures and supported Rh sites, and the construction of Figs.
3
and
5
, vibrational contributions were estimated based on the formation of six types of motif: surface and subsurface O vacancies, H adsorbed on surface O, H adsorbed on Rh and CO adsorbed on Rh pointing towards or away from the surface. The average margin of error of this approach was up to
k
B
T
per motif based on harmonic oscillator approximation (Supplementary Fig.
16
). To construct the final
T
/
P
CO
stability diagram of Rh sites (Fig.
4
), harmonic oscillator approximation was used instead.
Rh
13
was chosen as the Rh chemical potential reference due its resemblance to the Rh coordination environment determined by EXAFS after H
2
pretreatment
62
. Rh chemical potential was computed based on the cohesive energy of the Rh
13
cluster, its Gibbs free energy of adsorption and the configurational entropy of Rh
13
clusters (Supplementary Note
9
).
It is well known that the PBE functional overpredicts the strength of transition metal d-state-CO 2π* orbital back bonding
63
. Many methods have been employed to correct this problem
64
,
65
,
66
. Here, the singlet-triplet transition energy (Δ
E
ST
)-based method of Sumaria et al.
67
was developed and employed for Rh active sites, where a linear trendline was fitted between CO adsorption energy correction and relaxed C-O bond length (Supplementary Note
10
)
67
. CO adsorption energy correction brings values closer to those obtained from higher-level calculations
68
.
