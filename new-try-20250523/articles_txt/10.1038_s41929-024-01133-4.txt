Abstract
Photoelectrochemical production of ammonia (NH
3
) is potentially eco-friendly but suffers from a low solar-to-ammonia productivity (SAP) and requires a high additional bias for the overall NH
3
production from nitrate reduction and water oxidation. Here we applied a high-performance triple-cation lead halide (Cs

) perovskite photocathode with integrated electrocatalyst to achieve high SAP and coupled glycerol oxidation instead of water oxidation for bias-free NH
3
production. Stable, selective NH
3
production and glycerol oxidation were achieved by respectively loading Ru and Pt electrocatalysts on conductive and stable titanate nanosheet supports, instead of corrodible carbon-based supports. Our photoelectrochemical NH

perovskite as the active material in the photocathode, because it shows much higher performance compared with that of conventional inorganic-based materials due to its relatively narrow bandgap and good charge transport property
25
,
26
. However, because lead halide perovskites are very unstable in water
27
, we applied Ni foil to protect the perovskite layer from electrolyte permeation. In addition, we used Field’s metal (FM)
28
, which is an eutectic alloy of indium, tin and bismuth, to form an intimate junction between the Ni foil and perovskite layer for easier and better charge transport (
Methods
). We selected TiNS as a support material because it is more stable than carbon-based supports (corrodible in alkaline solutions) and possesses a larger surface area and better conductivity than TiO
2
nanoparticles (TiO
2
-NP). Furthermore, Ru and Pt electrocatalysts deposited on TiNS for the NITRR and GOR respectively, provided enhanced stability and selectivity with low overpotentials

production under AM 1.5 G simulated one-sun condition (100 mW cm

, which is the most remarkable performance among all PEC cells for NH

3
production, glycerol, a representative waste derived from biomass

Design of PEC cell for bias-free NH

The PEC cell, consisting of two compartments, is designed to simultaneously produce NH

) perovskite with Ru@TiNS as an electrocatalyst for selective NITRR in a nitrate-containing basic solution (0.5 M KNO
3
+ 1.0 M KOH). The anode side contains a basic solution (0.5 M glycerol + 1.0 M KOH), and glycerol is oxidized on the GOR electrocatalyst (Pt@TiNS). To protect the photocathode from water permeation, the perovskite light-absorbing layer was integrated with Ru@TiNS using FM and Ni foil (
Methods
). Furthermore, the edge of the perovskite photocathode was protected by an epoxy bond. The perovskite layer generates electron–hole pairs upon illumination. These photogenerated electrons reach Ru@TiNS via the conductive FM and Ni foil, while the photogenerated holes reach Pt@TiNS. This process allows continuous and simultaneous NH
3
production and glycerol valorization (Fig.
1
).

After dispersing the TiNS monolayers in ethylene glycol (EG), a modified polyol procedure was utilized to deposit Ru catalyst for NITRR on the surface of TiNS support (
Methods
)
35
. The obtained Ru@TiNS was analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), XPS, high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The results show that highly crystalline Ru-NP (average diameter 1.72 ± 0.31 nm) were homogeneously deposited at 24.9 wt.% on TiNS (Fig.
2e
and Supplementary Figs.
3
and
4
). Compared with pristine TiNS, the Ti 3
p
and O 1
s
peak positions of Ru@TiNS were blue shifted by 0.7 V and 0.5 V, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
4c,d
) due to the strong interaction between catalyst and support
34
,
36
. These results above reveal that the Ru electrocatalyst was tightly combined with TiNS.
The electrocatalytic performance of Ru@TiNS was measured under Ar and N
2
atmospheres both with and without NO
3
−
(Fig.
2g,h
), using an H-type cell that was connected to a gas chromatograph (for detecting H
2
gas) and equipped with a liquid sampling root (for measuring NH
3
concentration). Regardless of the atmosphere (Ar or N
2
), without NO
3
−
the onset potential was about −0.03 V versus RHE, and only the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurred (the onset potential is defined as the voltage at which 0.5 mA cm
−
2
is reached.). In the presence of NO
3
−
, NH
3
was produced at a high FE of >95.4%, and a shift of the onset potential by 0.3 V indicated that NITRR requires less energy than HER. The FE value for NH
3
production was the same in Ar and N
2
atmospheres (Supplementary Fig.
5a,b
). NH
3
quantification was performed by a colourimetric method (indophenol blue, Supplementary Fig.
6
) and further verified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (
1
H-NMR) (Supplementary Fig.
7
)
37
. The error between these two detection methods was <±5% (Supplementary Fig.
8
). Moreover, to further verify the source of NH
3
production, isotope measurements were conducted using
15
NO
3
−
or
15
N
2
(Supplementary Fig.
5c,d
and Supplementary Fig.
9
). The isotope measurements revealed a doublet peak corresponding to
15
NH
3
only when
15
NO
3
−
ions were present, whereas no doublet peak was observed in the presence of
15
N
2
. These isotope experiments strongly support and correlate with the aforementioned results and indicate that NH
3
originated solely from NO
3
−
ions instead of N
2
. In addition, the in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) results provided experimental evidence of N–O bond formation on Ru@TiNS, further confirming that NH
3
production originates from NO
3
−
ions (Supplementary Figs.
10
and
11
and Supplementary Note
1
).
To assess the role of TiNS support, the Ru catalyst was also loaded using the same polyol method on TiO
2
-NP (Ru@TiO
2
-NP) and reduced graphene oxide (Ru@rGO) supports with similar Ru loading (24.1–25.7%) to that of Ru@TiNS (24.9%, Supplementary Table
1
and Supplementary Fig.
12
). However, the average size of the loaded Ru nanoparticles was very different (7.39 ± 1.15 nm on TiO
2
-NP, 2.74 ± 0.65 nm on rGO, and 1.72 ± 0.31 nm on TiNS, Fig.
2b
and Supplementary Figs.
13a
and
14a
). The much larger diameter of Ru-NP on TiO
2
-NP is attributed to the relatively smaller surface area of the TiO
2
-NP substrate, which reduces the number of attachment sites for Ru-NP compared with the sheet-type TiNS (S
TiNS
≈ 4 S
TiO2-NP
, Supplementary Fig.
13b
). Although rGO also possesses a sheet-type morphology with large surface area (S
rGO
≈ 151 m
2
g
−
1
, Supplementary Fig.
14b
), the interaction between Ru and rGO support is relatively weak compared with that between Ru and TiNS, as measured by XPS analysis of Ru@TiNS and Ru@rGO (Supplementary Fig.
15
). The XPS results revealed strong Ru–Ti bonding in Ru@TiNS as denoted above, while Ru–C bonding was not found in Ru@rGO (Supplementary Fig.
15a,b
). In addition, all the Ru 3
p
and O 1
s
core level peaks clearly showed blue shifts (1.2 and 2.2 eV, respectively) for Ru@TiNS compared with Ru@rGO, indicating stronger Ru–Ti interaction than Ru–C interaction
38
(Supplementary Fig.
15c,d
). The relatively weaker interaction between Ru and rGO can cause the relatively larger Ru-NP size as well as the lower stability of Ru@rGO. To further explore the interaction between Ru and substrates, we employed X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) techniques for Ru@TiNS, Ru@TiO
2
-NP, Ru@rGO and reference Ru compounds (Fig.
2f
and Supplementary Fig.
16
). The analysis revealed that Ru@TiNS exhibited a characteristic mixture of Ru–Ru and Ru–Ti peaks at 2.3 Å (Supplementary Fig.
16a,b
). Complementary XPS results for Ru@TiNS also confirmed the presence of Ru–Ti peaks (Supplementary Fig.
2b, d
). These findings suggest that Ru nanoparticles are strongly linked to the TiNS surface through oxygen vacancy sites, resulting in the formation of a Ru–Ti bond. However, Ru@TiO
2
-NP shows two peaks at 1.4 and 2.3 Å (Supplementary Fig.
16b
) that are related Ru–O and Ru–Ru bonds, respectively. Ru@rGO shows more complex oxidation states of Ru (Supplementary Fig.
16c
).
Relative to Ru@TiO
2
-NP, the current density–voltage (
J
–
V
) curve of Ru@TiNS shows an anodic shift of the onset potential by 0.3 V and a three times higher current density for NITRR (Fig.
2i
). Ru@TiNS presents even higher activity and stability relative to Ru@rGO. The higher activity of Ru@TiNS relative to Ru@TiO
2
-NP is due to the more numerous and smaller Ru-NP as active sites and the much higher conductivity of TiNS compared with TiO
2
-NP (Supplementary Fig.
17a
). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that TiNS exhibits higher conductivity compared with TiO
2
-NP (please refer to Supplementary Note
2
and Supplementary Fig.
18
for the detailed explanation). The presence of oxygen vacancies on TiNS transforms its semiconducting nature (Supplementary Fig.
19a
) into a metallic one (Supplementary Fig.
19b–e
). The unbound Ti 3
d
electrons create additional electronic states near the Fermi level, resulting in increased conductivity and facilitating faster charge transfer from the electrode to the electrolyte (Supplementary Fig.
20
). The higher stability of Ru@TiNS than Ru@rGO is attributed to the stable nature of inorganic TiNS (unlike the carbon-based rGO substrate) and strong interaction between Ru and TiNS, as explained above. The NH
3
FE over Ru@TiNS was >95% under a wide range of applied potentials (Fig.
2j
and Supplementary Fig.
21a
). Also, we measured FE (%) at several low nitrate concentrations, similar to those found in real wastewater (Supplementary Fig.
21b
). These results indicate the wide applicability of Ru@TiNS catalyst for selective production of NH
3
. Furthermore, upon increasing the negative bias, NH
3
production rate increased exponentially while maintaining a high FE (Fig.
2j
), which is favourable for practical applications. The electrocatalytic NITRR was operated continuously for 24 h at a high current density of 200 mA cm
−
2
, and there was no sign of degradation in performance and FE (Fig.
2k
). Electrocatalytic conversion of isotopically labelled
15
NO
3
−
to
15
NH
3
is measured at different time to discriminate the source of NH
3
. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
22a
,
1
H-NMR peaks only revealed the presence of doublet peaks with a spacing of 52 Hz corresponding to
15
NH
3
. The concentration and FE (%) for
15
NH
3
were also calculated for NITRR (Supplementary Fig.
22b
), indicating a good confirmation with indophenol blue method. The electrocatalytic performance of Ru@TiNS for NH
3
production is compared with previously developed electrocatalysts for NITRR (Supplementary Table
2
). To the best of our knowledge, the observed NH
3
production rate is the best among all reported electrocatalysts for NH
3
production (Supplementary Fig.
23
).

) perovskite as photoactive material, considering the balance in photocurrent and photovoltage and its relatively high photothermal stability
26
,
39
. The perovskite layer absorbs sunlight and generates charges, and the generated charges are selectively transported to the corresponding electrodes. For selective hole transfer from the perovskite layer to indium tin oxide (ITO), we inserted a PFN-Br/PTAA double layer (where PFN-Br is poly(9,9-bis(3′-(
N
,
N
-dimethyl)-
N
-ethylammonium-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctlyfluorene) dibromide) and PTAA is poly-(triaryl) amine)
26
. The perovskite layer was fabricated using a conventional antisolvent dropping method. To improve the protection against moisture, photo- and thermal stress, a poly methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) protective layer was inserted between the perovskite layer and the electron transport layer (PCBM/BCP)
40
. The PMMA layer serves dual purposes of enhancing stability (as denoted above) and improving performance by mitigating surface defects, as depicted in Supplementary Fig.
24
. However, an excessively thick PMMA layer leads to a decreased performance by reducing charge transport efficiency. A PMMA layer with an optimal thickness of approximately 4 nm yields the best results (Supplementary Fig.
24
and Supplementary Table
4
). This thickness also aligns with the values reported in the literature
37
,
41
. To collect electrons, an Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation at a reduced pressure (~10
−
6
Torr). Onto the Ag cathode, Ni foil was connected with FM to form a charge conducting junction. Finally, the electrocatalyst (Ru@TiNS) was deposited on the Ni foil to complete the perovskite-based photocathode configuration (Fig.
3a
), as shown in the band structure diagram in Supplementary Fig.
25
. Notably, all fabrication processes for the photocathode were performed at relatively lower temperatures (<100 °C), which can potentially decrease the fabrication cost of the photocathode and the system.

By using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with AM 1.5 G simulated one-sun in 1.0 M KOH solution, the
J
–
V
curves of photocathodes in various configurations were measured (Fig.
3b
). We prepared three types of perovskite photocathode: perovskite without passivation (bare perovskite), Ni foil on the perovskite (Ni/perovskite) and Ru@TiNS on Ni/perovskite (Ru@TiNS/Ni/perovskite). The onset potential of bare perovskite was −0.3 V versus RHE, whereas that of Ni/perovskite was shifted anodically by 670 mV (indicating a lower required bias) with a much higher saturated photocurrent density of >20 mA cm
−
2
. Furthermore, the bare perovskite without Ni foil passivation lost its performance in a few minutes, while Ni/perovskite showed stable performance for 3 h (Fig.
3c
). When Ru@TiNS was loaded on Ni/perovskite, the onset potential was further shifted to 1.5 V (Fig.
3d
), indicating that Ru@TiNS adds substantial electrocatalytic activity for NITRR. The conversion of nitrate (NO
3
−
) to nitrite (NO
2
−
) has been suggested to be the rate-determining step of NH
3
production in NITRR
19
, a possibility to be explored by examining electrocatalyst performance in the presence of NO
2
−
versus NO
3
−
. Notably, the Ru@TiNS/Ni/perovskite photocathode gave almost identical LSV curves in the two solutions, whereas Ni/perovskite showed a measurably more positive onset potential in nitrite solution compared with that in the NO
3
−
solution, suggesting that Ru@TiNS is more effective at addressing the initial steps in the NITRR reaction. Furthermore, the Ru@TiNS/Ni/perovskite photocathode showed a high FE towards NH
3
production (93.7 ± 0.6%), while the Ni/perovskite photocathode without Ru@TiNS showed only 37.9 ± 3.3% during 3 h continuous illumination under one-sun condition (Fig.
3e
). Besides NH
3
, the only other product generated over Ru@TiNS was NO
2
−
. These results, together with those of Fig.
3d
and Supplementary Fig.
26
, show that Ru@TiNS can efficiently convert NO
3
−
to NO
2
−
and then to NH
3
, whereas Ni foil itself cannot carry out either conversion step as efficiently (Supplementary Fig.
27
). During the PEC measurement for Ru@TiNS/Ni/perovskite photocathode, the amount of

To further verify the performance of the Ru@TiNS/Ni/perovskite photocathode for NITRR, in 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M KNO
3
, the incident-photon-to-conversion efficiency (IPCE) was assessed utilizing a three-electrode arrangement (Fig.
3g
). Equation (
1
) was used to determine the IPCE as
$${\rm{IPCE}}\,( \% )=\left(\frac{\text{1,240}\times {J_{\mathrm{p}}}}{{{P}}_{\lambda }\times \lambda }\right)\times 100,$$

where

and

are the photocurrent density (mA cm

, respectively. In the range 400–680 nm, we obtained an IPCE of >90%, which corresponds to an integrated photocurrent density of 20.23 mA cm
−2
(Fig.
3g
). This integrated photocurrent density agrees well with the photocurrent density obtained from the LSV curve (
J

). In addition, NH

was stably produced over the Ru@TiNS-based perovskite photocathode during a period of 24 h (Fig.

Characterization and GOR performance of Pt-loaded TiNS
The GOR electrocatalyst (Pt@TiNS) was prepared by the same procedure as Ru@TiNS, except for utilizing H
2
PtCl
6
as the metal precursor. The XRD and HR-TEM results (Supplementary Figs.
31
and
32
) confirm the crystalline structure of Pt-NP, with a
d
-spacing of 0.23 nm corresponding to the (111) planes. The presence of Pt-NP is also reflected by the Pt 4
f
core level peaks in XPS analysis (Fig.
4a
). ICP, TEM and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) coupled with EDS element mapping (Fig.
4b,c
) showed that 21.9 wt.% Pt (particle size 3.53 ± 0.69 nm) was decorated onto micro-size TiNS substrate. When the same procedure was conducted on TiO
2
-NP, a similar amount of Pt (22.6 wt.%) was deposited, but the average Pt particle size was substantially larger (10.82 ± 2.95 nm) due to the smaller surface area of TiO
2
-NP (Supplementary Table
3
and Supplementary Fig.
33
). Similar to Ru@TiNS, the same blue shift was detected in the Ti 2
p
high-resolution peaks for Pt@TiNS relative to Pt@TiO
2
-NP, indicating the presence of oxygen vacancies and Ti
3+
(Supplementary Fig.
34a,b
). The Pt 4
f
spectra of Pt@TiNS, Pt@TiO
2
-NP and Pt@C also show similar trends in the oxidation state of Ru (Supplementary Figs.
4
and
15
). Pt@TiNS shows mostly metallic species, indicating strong Pt–Ti bond formation (Supplementary Fig.
34b
,
e
). However, in the case of Pt@TiO
2
and Pt@C, partially oxidized Pt peaks appeared without showing the respective Pt–Ti and Pt–C bonds, which indicates weak interaction between these elements (Supplementary Fig.
34d,f
). We then compared the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of Pt@TiNS, Pt-TiO
2
-NP and a conventional Pt@C catalyst known to be active for GOR (20% Pt loading, Aldrich) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M aqueous glycerol solution (pH 14, Fig.
4d
and Supplementary Table
3
). All three catalysts showed different current–voltage behaviours, reaching different peak current densities at different voltages, indicative of mass transport effects. The peak current density of Pt@TiNS was ~300 mA cm
−
2
at 1.14 V versus RHE, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of Pt@TiO
2
-NP (~25 mA cm
−
2
at 0.85 V versus RHE) and double that of Pt@C (~150 mA cm
−
2
at 1.0 V versus RHE). The performance of Pt@C catalyst was similar to previously reported ones under various conditions (Supplementary Note
5
, Supplementary Table
5
and Supplementary Fig.
35
). To probe performance and stability within a kinetically limited regime, chronoamperometry measurements were conducted at 0.6 V versus RHE (Fig.
4e
and Supplementary Fig.
36
), revealing Pt@TiNS to be superior to both Pt@C and Pt@TiO
2
-NP. As mentioned in previous sections, carbon-based supports show high activity because of their high conductivity and large surface area but are unstable due to easy corrosion and weak interaction with the loaded Pt. TiO
2
-NP as an inorganic material is stable, yet it is not active owing to the low conductivity and small surface area. On the other hand, TiNS has not only good stability but also higher conductivity (indicated by impedance measurements in Supplementary Fig.
37
), large surface area (Supplementary Fig.
13b
) and high density of states (DFT results in Supplementary Fig.
18
), resulting in a higher activity.

Unassisted NH
3
production via simultaneous glycerol valorization
Finally, we combined the Ru@TiNS/Ni/perovskite photocathode with the Pt@TiNS anode for bias-free NH
3
production with glycerol valorization. Figure
5a
shows LSV scans of the Ru@TiNS/Ni/perovskite photocathode overlapped with conventional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and GOR. In the absence of glycerol (that is, when NH
3
production is combined with OER), the operating photocurrent decreases to 1.4 mA cm
−
2
while with GOR the operating photocurrent is 20.5 mA cm
−
2
at 0.0 V versus CE (Fig.
5a
and Supplementary Fig.
38
). These findings indicate that replacing OER with GOR is very critical for high-performance NH
3
production by lowering the required voltage. When 0.5 M glycerol was replaced with other biomass-derived reactants, such as 0.5 M EG or 0.5 M glucose, an unassisted photocurrent was also realized at 0.0 V versus CE, implying the possibility of using a wide range of biomass for highly efficient NH
3
production (Fig.
5b
). During 24-h operation using glycerol, this system maintained a stable photocurrent of 21.2 ± 0.7 mA cm

3
production (Fig.

and Supplementary Table

).
GOR occurred on the Pt@TiNS anode at the same time as NH
3
production, and the GOR products were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Calibration curves obtained from the chromatograms are included in Supplementary Fig.
40
. For GOR on Pt@TiNS, we obtained GA and LA with a total FE of 98.1 ± 2.4% after 1 h, and the ratios of GA and LA were similar (Fig.
5h
, Supplementary Fig.
41
and Supplementary Note
6
). However, when the reaction time was prolonged to 10 h, the portion of GA gradually increased while that of LA decreased (Fig.
5h
). According to the known GOR mechanism (Supplementary Fig.
42
), glycerol is first oxidized to glyceraldehyde (GDA) through a two-electron transfer step, and then GDA is transformed to LA thorough dehydration followed by keto-enol tautomerization and benzylic acid rearrangement
42
. However, GDA could be further oxidized to GA through a two-electron transfer step as oxidation reaction proceeded on the anode, and thus the ratio of GA/LA increases with time (Supplementary Fig.
43
). A portion of GA and LA underwent further oxidation to form tartaric acid (TA) and formic acid (FA), respectively (Supplementary Fig.
41
). However, the FE of these reactions remained below 10% for each product, indicating low selectivity (>8.5%, Supplementary Fig.
41
). At steady state, the FE for GA reached 70%, much higher than the other three (12%, 10% and 9% for LA, FA and TA, respectively, Fig.
5h
). The net charge was conserved during the unassisted NITRR and GOR, as discussed in Supplementary Fig.
44
and Supplementary Note
6
. From these results, our system not only selectively produces NH
3
with high FE and SAP values, but also selectively generates GA as a major product at longer reaction times. Notably, these products were generated using only solar energy from chemicals considered as waste or low-value compounds, namely NO
3
−
as a contaminant in water
5
,
43
and glycerol as representative byproduct of biomass on the cathode and anode sides, respectively. GA is a vital intermediate in the food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. With an average price of around US$7,500 per ton, GA is approximately nine times more expensive than glycerol, which typically costs US$600–1,000 per ton
17
,
44
. This substantial price difference underscores the value and market demand for GA within those industries. However, to minimize the cost of separating GA from other side products, the ratio of GA production should be enhanced by developing more selective electrocatalysts.
After 24 h of unassisted solar NITRR with simultaneous GOR, we performed ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) measurement on the perovskite photocathode and ICP-OES measurement on the catholyte and anolyte to check the stability of perovskite layer and catalysts (Supplementary Table
7
and Supplementary Fig.
45
). There was no notable change in the UV–Vis spectrum, and Pb was also undetected (Supplementary Fig.
45
and Supplementary Table
7
, respectively), indicating that the perovskite layer was stable after the test. Ru or Pt ions were not detected in the electrolytes when using TiNS as catalyst support. However, when we used TiO
2
-NP or carbon supports (rGO and carbon), small and considerable amounts of Ru and Pt were detected, respectively. These results indicate that a strong interaction between catalyst (Ru or Pt) and support (TiNS) is important for not only high performance but also high stability of the catalysts.
Discussion
We demonstrated unassisted NH
3
production with simultaneous glycerol valorization using a Ru@TiNS/Ni/perovskite photocathode and a Pt@TiNS anode. The high-performance and stable triple-cation halide perovskite enabled a high NH
3
production rate, and the substitution of OER with GOR reduced the required voltage. Furthermore, due to its good stability, conductivity and large surface area, TiNS was used as catalyst instead of conventional carbon-based or TiO
2
-NP supports for stable, selective and high-performance NITRR and GOR. Using this approach, we achieved a photocurrent density of 21.2 ± 0.7 mA cm

This leads to high system efficiency and system productivity as both the anode and cathode contribute to producing value-added products from low-value/waste compounds. This motivates additional research and development, for example, on system scaleup and separation processes, to enable commercial systems.

layered oxide was protonated by soaking in HCl solution (0.5 M) at room temperature for 3 days, and the solution was replaced daily with a fresh batch. To produce TiNS, the protonated titanate crystals (H
1.0
Ti
1.73
O

) were dispersed in an aqueous solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) and then shaken gently for 2 days. The molar ratio between TMAOH and the protonated solid was 1:1, and the solid-to-solution ratio was controlled at 4.0 mg ml
−
1
. To avoid the deleterious impact of TMAOH molecules in electrocatalytic applications, TiNS was purified by adding an appropriate amount of Mg(NO
3
)
2
(0.5 M). Then, the suspension was separated by centrifugation for 30 min at 1,610
g
at room temperature. The supernatant containing TMA

NO

−
was discarded, and TiNS was collected as a precipitate. The precipitate was re-suspended in HCl (1 M) and sonicated for 30 min, to convert residual Mg(OH)
2
into MgCl
2
and remove it with the supernatant after centrifugation (2,862
g
). Finally, TiNS was dispersed in EG by a simple shaking process.
Preparation of Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS
TiNS loaded with Ru and Pt (denoted as Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS, respectively) were prepared by a modified polyol method. An appropriate amount of RuCl
3
or H
2
PtCl
6
precursor was added to isolated TiNS to reach 25 wt.% Ru or 20 wt.% Pt. Typically, TiNS (200 mg) was first dispersed in EG (50 ml) by shaking. Then, the Ru precursor solution (103.13 mg RuCl
3
·
x
H
2
O dissolved in 10 ml deionized water, equivalent to 50.25 mg of Ru) was added dropwise to TiNS dispersed in EG. In the case of Pt@TiNS, the Pt precursor solution (107.92 mg H
2
PtCl
6
·6H
2
O dissolved in 10 ml deionized water, equivalent to 40.63 mg of Pt) was added dropwise to 200 mg TiNS dispersed in EG. The end product was heated for 3 h at 190 °C in an N
2
environment. The final step involved centrifuging Ru@TiNS or Pt@TiNS after washing them three times in acetone. For comparison, Ru (or Pt) loaded onto TiO
2
nanoparticles (TiO
2
-NP) was synthesized with the same procedure but replacing TiNS with TiO
2
.
Preparation of the catalyst ink and working electrode
To study the electrocatalytic performance, a uniform ink dispersion was prepared by sonicating 2.0 mg of the electrocatalyst in 0.95 ml ethanol and 0.05 ml Nafion solution (5 wt.%) for 30 min, followed by stirring for 10 h. The obtained ink was sprayed onto the surface (1.5 cm
2
) of a clean carbon paper (CP) on a hotplate at 120 °C. The catalyst loading was accurately measured by weighting the CP with a microbalance with and without the electrocatalyst. The catalyst inks were sprayed onto one side of CP at a weight density of 1 mg cm
−
2
. Considering that the electrocatalyst contained 25 wt.% of Ru or 20 wt.% of Pt, the Ru or Pt mass density was about 0.25 and 0.2 mg cm
−
2
, respectively.
Preparation of perovskite-based photocathode
ITO/glass substrates were treated with UV/ozone for 30 min and then transferred to a N
2
-filled glovebox with both H

O and O
2
levels below 0.1 ppm. A PTAA solution (2 mg ml
−

in toluene) was spin-cast at 4,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 100 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, a PFN-Br solution (0.5 mg ml
−
1
in methanol) was deposited onto the PTAA films. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving caesium iodide (CsI; 0.06 M), formamidinium iodide (FAI; 1 M), methylammonium bromide (MABr; 0.2 M), lead iodide (PbI
2
; 1.1 M), lead bromide (PbBr
2
; 0.2 M) and oleylamine (0.1 wt.%) in 1 ml of dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvent (4/1, v/v). The perovskite layer was deposited using a two-step spin-coating procedure at 1,000 rpm for 5 s and then 5,000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 150 µl of chlorobenzene as an antisolvent was quickly dropped on the centre 10 s before the end of the whole spinning process. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The perovskite film was coated with PMMA (1 mg ml
−
1
in ethyl acetate) and spun at 5,000 rpm before being heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The electron transporting layer was deposited by spin-casting a PC
61
BM solution (25 mg ml

in chlorobenzene) at 1,000 rpm for 30 s and a BCP solution (1 mg ml
−
1
in isopropyl alcohol) at 4,000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 150-nm-thick Ag electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation at <10
−
6
Torr. Ru@TiNS was sprayed on a piece of CP. After drying, the Ru@TiNS loaded on CP was connected to the Ni foil (0.6 cm × 0.6 cm, thickness ~0.1 mm, Alfa Aesar) with the silver (Ag) paste. This configuration was then attached to the Ag layer (top electrode of the perovskite solar cell) using FM, where it was melted at its melting point (62 °C), followed by cooling to room temperature according to a previous report
28
. The edges were then covered with epoxy resin. Finally, to complete the fabrication, small, enamelled piece of copper wire was connected to the samples via Ag paste, leaving them for at least 24 h to dry completely.
Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NITRR)
All NITRR experiments were performed in a three-electrode H-cell configuration, with constant stirring at 500 rpm in both compartments. CP with sprayed catalyst ink was used as the working electrode; Hg/HgO or Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in alkaline or acidic medium, respectively; and a piece of clean Pt wire as the CE. The applied potential was expressed relative to the RHE using the following equation for conversion:
$$E,{V}_{{{\mathrm{RHE}}}}=E,{V}_{\frac{{{\mathrm{Hg}}}}{{{\mathrm{HgO}}}}}\left({{\mathrm{or}}\; E},{V}_{\frac{{{\mathrm{Ag}}}}{{{\mathrm{AgCl}}}}}\right)+0.59\,{{\mathrm{pH}}}.$$

The two compartments in the H-cell were separated by a Nafion membrane. The concentrations of NH

electrolyte solution in the catholyte compartment. In the experiments, the H-cell was filled with 50 ml electrolyte solution in each half, and the system was connected online to the gas chromatograph to analyse the HER.

2
) was used as the working electrode, Pt wire as the CE, and Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. A two-compartment cell was filled with 50 ml of 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M glycerol as electrolyte on each side. The product concentration and selectivity were measured by a Waters 2535 high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with UV and refractive index detectors and a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H sugar column.
PEC measurement
PEC measurements were performed on each individual photocathode utilizing a half-cell reactor in 1.0 M KOH with various KNO
3
concentrations in a conventional three-electrode system. The working, reference and counter electrodes were integrated perovskite photocathode, Hg/HgO (1.0 M NaOH), and Pt mesh (1 cm × 1 cm). All potentials were measured against the Hg/HgO reference electrode and converted to the RHE reference scale using the equation
E
(
V
versus RHE) =
E
(
V
versus Hg/HgO) + 0.059 × pH + 0.118. For the unassisted measurement system, PEC tests were performed to reveal the long-term stability and concentration of formed products using 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M KNO
3
(50 ml) as the catholyte and 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M glycerol (50 ml) as the anolyte. The home-made glass reactor was used to conduct the unassisted experiments. A Nafion 117 membrane that had been pre-activated by soaking in deionized water for 2 h divided this two-compartment reactor in the middle. The geometric area of the photocathodes was used to normalize all current densities, and a 10 mV s
−
1
scan rate was maintained. The simulated AM 1.5 G one-sun irradiation was achieved by using a water filter and a 300 W xenon lamp. By aligning a silicon reference cell (approved by Newport Corporation; PEC-SI01, Peccell Technologies) parallel to the light beam from the xenon lamp, the light intensity was adjusted on the ITO side (backside illumination) to one sun. The device was covered by black tape except for an aperture area of 0.096 cm
2
, which determined the illumination area. The absorbance measurements were conducted on a UV–Vis spectrometer (Agilent Cary 5000). The thickness of the PMMA layer was measured by first depositing the layer on thin ITO glass and then conducting ellipsometry (Elli-SE-UaM8).
Indophenol blue method
UV–Vis spectroscopy was utilized to measure NH
3
concentration by the indophenol blue method
29
,
37
,
46
. The samples were collected through the gas-sealed syringe line and diluted enough to be within detectable range. Then, into 1 ml mixed solution containing 1 M NaOH, 5 wt.% salicylic acid and 5 wt.% sodium citrate, 1 ml of diluted sample was added. In the next step, 0.5 ml NaClO (0.05 M) was added and mixed by pipetting method. Finally, 0.1 ml sodium nitroferricyanide solution (1.0 wt.%) was added, mixed and kept for 1 h under dark before UV–Vis spectrophotometry measurement. The peak absorbance at 655 nm was recorded, and the NH
3
concentration was calculated by calibration curve obtained using NH
4
Cl solutions (Supplementary Fig.
6a,b
).
The NH
3
concentration was also measured by
1
H-NMR (500 MHz) according to a previous reported procedure
46
. The sample was diluted to the detection range and mixed with 0.1 ml DMSO, and its NMR spectrum was acquired on a Liquid Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer. The NH
3
concentration was evaluated using a standard calibration curve (Supplementary Fig.
7
).
Nitrite detection
The nitrite concentration was measured using a spectroscopy procedure reported elsewhere
29
.
p
-Aminobenzenesulfonamide (2.0 g) was dissolved in 50 ml deionized water. Another solution was prepared by mixing ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.1 g) and phosphoric acid (3.94 ml) in 50 ml deionized water. Both solutions were stored in the refrigerator and mixed in 1:1 volume ratio (colouring agent) just before the UV–Vis measurement. Then, 1.0 ml of the collected sample was diluted to reach the detection range, and 2.0 ml H
2
SO
4
(0.5 M) was added and finally 1.0 ml of the above prepared colouring agent. By using UV–Vis spectrophotometry, the intensity of the spectral peak at 540 nm was determined (UV-2600). A calibration curve was used to determine the concentration (Supplementary Fig.
6c,d
).
Isotopically labelled ammonia (
15
NH
3
) detection
To exclude the possibility of NH
3
detection by another source of contaminations (N
2
reduction reaction, electrode contamination or NH
3
injection through gas line or in air) isotopically labelled K
15
NO
3
(Sigma-Aldrich, 98 atom%
15
N) was utilized as N-source and the corresponding
15
NH
3
+
was quantified by
15
NH
3
+
(Agilent (Varian) VNMRS-600MHz spectrometer). Due to the clear identification of
15
NH
3
+
with doublet
15
NH
3
+
from triplet peaks of
14
NH
3
+
, overestimation of NH
3
concentration and consequently FE, percentage can be cancelled effectively. Isotopically labelled experiments were conducted for both electrocatalytic and PEC conversion of K
15
NO
3
to
15
NH
4
+
. The sample was taken from electrolyte at different time after starting reaction and then acidified to pH 3 by adding appropriate 3 M HCl. The sample then mixed with 0.1 ml DMSO, and its
1
H-NMR spectrum was obtained. The
15
NH
4
+
concentration was quantified based on the calibration curve acquired by a set of
15
NH
4
Cl (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 atom%
15
N) standard solutions (Supplementary Fig.
9
).
Anolyte product quantification
A certain amount of aliquot was analysed after each experiment using HPLC to calculate selectivity of the products via an Agilent 1260 infinity 2 chromatography equipped with a Hi-Plex H (7.7 × 300 mm, 8 μm) column. The selectivity of products was calculated by the following equation:
$${{\mathrm{Selectivity}}}=\frac{{N}_{{\mathrm{D}}}}{{N}_{{\mathrm{T}}}}\times 100$$
(6)
$${\rm{Yield}}, \% =\frac{{N}_{{\mathrm{D}}}}{{a\times N}_{{\mathrm{i}}}}\times 100$$
(7)
where
N
T
is the total sum of desired and undesired products,
N
i
is the initial concentration of glycerol and
N
D
is the desired product. For its quantification, the standard calibration curve was plotted on the basis of the concentration and integrated area in HPLC. Here the solvent for standard solution was H
2
SO
4
with proper concentration recommended for column.
Characterization of materials
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in contact mode was utilized to measure the thickness and lateral size of isolated TiNS on the surface of a clean silicon wafer. TEM, HR-TEM and EDS attached to the TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F) were used to examine the uniform deposition of nanoparticles on the TiNS surface, and the crystallinity and
d
-spacing of Ru-NP and Pt-NP on the TiNS surface. Crystallinity of the prepared catalysts was examined by XRD (Rigaku D/MAX2500V/PC) with a copper rotating-anode X-ray source operating at 40 kV and 200 mA. XPS was utilized to study not only the elemental composition by full scan spectra, but also the oxidation states of elements by core-level peak fitting with a mixed function of 80% Gaussian and 20% Lorentzian after subtracting the Shirley background. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments were conducted in transmission mode at PLS-II 6D UNIST-PAL beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in Korea, operating at an electron energy of 3 GeV and a stored top-up current of ~250 mA. X-ray coming from the bending magnet was monochromated using a Si(111) double crystals monochromator (Kohzu Precision-Co. Ltd) with an energy resolution (Δ
E
/
E
) of 2 × 10
−
4
. The incidence and transmitted X-ray intensities were monitored using IC Spec Ionization Chambers (FMB Oxford). Energy calibration was simultaneously carried out for each measurement with a standard metal foil placed in front of the third ionization chamber. After allowing the sample to dissolve in a 3:1 solution of HCl and HNO
3
called aqua regia and measuring the results using ICP-OES, the amounts of noble metals (Pt and Ru) on the TiNS surface were determined (Varian 700-ES).
Electrochemical in situ ATR-FTIR measurement
ATR-FTIR experiments were conducted in a custom flow cell. A peristaltic pump propelled the electrolyte over the working electrode at 20 ml min
−1
. Infrared (IR) spectra were collected using a Nicolet IS30 spectrometer equipped with an ATR-FTIR (VeeMAX III) with liquid nitrogen-cooled detector. A Si ATR crystal covered with 10 nm of Ti was used as the internal reflection element. The catalyst was then pressed down to the window surface. For each measurement, 128 spectra were collected at a resolution of 4 cm
−
1
and averaged. Each potential was held until IR spectra became stable. The IR spectrum collected at 0.5 V versus RHE served as the background for all spectra collected at subsequent potentials. The experiments were conducted in 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M K
14
NO
3
with D
2
O as a solvent. D
2
O solvent was used to clearly differentiate the adsorbate peaks, while other electrolytes including 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M KNO
2
and H
2
O were also used for comparison.
Computational details
Spin-polarized DFT implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) was used for all calculations
47
. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional
48
within generalized gradient approximation was used to model exchange–correlation interactions. The projector augmented wave method was employed to describe the electron–nucleus interactions. To investigate the onsite Coulomb interaction of Ti 3
d
states, the Hubbard
U
values of 2.58 and 3 eV were selected, namely DFT +
U
, according to previous reports on TiO
2
(refs.
49
,
50
,
51
). The energy cut-off was 500 eV, and at least 15 Å vacuum space was applied to avoid interactions between adjacent layers in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The rutile TiO
2
(110) slab including three layers of O–Ti–O (nine atomic layers) that contained 108 atoms, 36 Ti and 72 O, (Supplementary Fig.
19
) was utilized as geometrical model in which all layers were fully relaxed. The Brillouin zone of supercell was sampled using 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack
k
-point grid, while denser
k
-points of 7 × 7 × 1 was employed for calculating density of states. The energy convergence and residual force criteria in the self-consistent field were set to 10
−
5
eV and 0.02 eV Å
−1
, respectively.

M.A.M. prepared and characterized the perovskite. R.M. integrated perovskite with Ru@TiNS and conducted the PEC experiments. A.T. and R.M. designed and performed the bias-free experiments. M.Z. and G.L. performed the DFT calculations and analysed them. M.T. analysed and deconvoluted the XPS results. D.O. helped with the UV–Vis and HPLC measurements. D.O., J.E.M., S.-W.L. and T.F.J. measured and analysed the in situ IR spectra. S.-h.L. and T.J.S. conducted XANES and EXAFS experiments and analysed them. A.T., R.M., M.A.M., J.K., T.F.J., J.S.-Y. and J.-W.J. co-wrote the manuscript. All authors read and commented on the manuscript.
