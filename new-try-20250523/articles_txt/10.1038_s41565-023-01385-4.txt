Abstract
Storing solar energy in chemical bonds aided by heterogeneous photocatalysis is desirable for sustainable energy conversion. Despite recent progress in designing highly active photocatalysts, inefficient solar energy and mass transfer, the instability of catalysts and reverse reactions impede their practical large-scale applications. Here we tackle these challenges by designing a floatable photocatalytic platform constructed from porous elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposites. The nanocomposites at the air–water interface feature efficient light delivery, facile supply of water and instantaneous gas separation. Consequently, a high hydrogen evolution rate of 163 mmol h
–1
m
–2
can be achieved using Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel, even without forced convection. When fabricated in an area of 1 m
2
and incorporated with economically feasible single-atom Cu/TiO
2
photocatalysts, the nanocomposites produce 79.2 ml of hydrogen per day under natural sunlight. Furthermore, long-term stable hydrogen production in seawater and highly turbid water and photoreforming of polyethylene terephthalate demonstrate the potential of the nanocomposites as a commercially viable photocatalytic system.

, the development of photocatalytic platforms and their large-scale applications for efficient solar hydrogen (H
2
) production have not been well explored.
For the efficient scale up of photocatalysis, in addition to the intrinsic activity of photocatalysts
27
,
28
, several additional factors need to be considered, particularly the design of photocatalytic systems
29
. For example, the slurry reactor, a primary form for large-scale photocatalysis, is not ideal due to the aggregation of catalyst particles, severe light scattering and the high cost of continuous agitation. Recently, reactors with immobilized photocatalysts such as particulate-sheet-type
30
, film-type
31
and flat-panel-type
32
systems have been proposed to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. Nevertheless, these platforms still have many practical limitations, including the additional requirement of photoelectrodes and forced convection, potential reverse reactions during product separation, continuous leaching of photocatalysts, and poor mass transfer to and from closely packed photocatalysts.
Adopting a hydrogel as a macroporous matrix to immobilize photocatalysts may prevent the leaching of catalysts, increase the catalyst-loading capacity and improve mass transfer
33
,
34
. Therefore, compared with the systems using closely packed photocatalyst films, photocatalysts embedded in the hydrogel have the potential to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency
35
,
36
. Furthermore, the hydrogel matrix has the flexibility to accommodate various types of nanosized filler material
37
,
38
, which guarantees the broad applicability of the hydrogel nanocomposites with various photocatalytic filler materials. Unfortunately, conventional hydrogel–photocatalyst nanocomposites are typically submerged in water, which leads to poor catalytic performance. For example, due to the attenuation of underwater light intensity
39
, only ~30% of the light reaches the hydrogel placed at 2 m below the surface. Additional challenges such as the lack of long-term stability of the underwater hydrogel and the possibility of reverse reactions due to inefficient product separation prevent the wider utility of this approach.
To address these issues and maximize the photocatalytic activity, we present here a floatable photocatalytic platform using porous elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposites. Located at the air–water interface, the floatable nanocomposites feature efficient light delivery, facile gas separation and reduced back-oxidation of H
2
. Immobilizing photocatalysts in the porous elastomer–hydrogel hybrid and additional engineering of the material components allow excellent reactant supply, enable high floatability, prevent leaching of catalysts and provide long-term material stability
40
,
41
,
42
. These unique advantages are experimentally and theoretically verified, and large-scale solar H
2
production is demonstrated. The floatable nanocomposites exhibit practical advantages for solar H
2
production from the perspective of product recovery, cost, performance and scalability.
Overview of floatable photocatalytic nanocomposites
The nanocomposites have a bilayer structure (Fig.
1a
). The upper layer is a photocatalytic layer composed of hydrophilic polyurethane (HPU) and poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) polymers along with photocatalysts. The lower layer, which is a supporting layer and is composed of the same backbone polymers of HPU and PPG, keeps the nanocomposites afloat (Extended Data Fig.
1a–d
). The floatable nanocomposites expose the upper photocatalytic layer above the water surface, enabling both efficient light delivery with minimum water-induced light attenuation (Fig.
1a(i)
) and facile separation of the generated H
2
gas (Fig.
1a(ii)
). The hydrophobic silica aerogel on top of the catalytic layer maximizes floatability and minimizes the chances of sinking by enhancing the surface tension of the nanocomposites (Fig.
1a(iii)
). Furthermore, highly durable elastomer–hydrogel (HPU–PPG) composites enable the immobilization of photocatalysts for a long-term period with retained activity (Fig.
1a(iv)
). As the mass flow of the reactant (water) and product (H
2
) is directed from the bottom to the top, the floatable nanocomposites facilitate the gas separation and suppress the back-oxidation of H
2
(Fig.
1a(v)
). The high porosity and hydrophilicity of the nanocomposites also play crucial roles in providing easy access to water for the photocatalyst (Fig.
1a(vi)
).

A photocatalytic layer with a Janus structure is formed by the addition of silica aerogel (iii). A bilayer system is fabricated by the integration of a photocatalytic layer and a supporting layer with the aid of EtOH (iv).

2
NPs; Fig.
1b
, third row) that were prepared by following the previous report
2
show the fabrication process of the nanocomposites. First, HPU (brown chain) and PPG (red chain) mixed with sodium chloride (NaCl) (blue circle) are crosslinked by hydrogen bonding to form the HPU–PPG–NaCl gel, in which the photocatalysts (Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel or Cu-SA/TiO
2
NPs) are embedded (Fig.
1b(i)
). The solvent evaporation followed by swelling in water produces highly porous nanocomposites due to the space left after the dissolution of NaCl incorporated in the gelation process (Fig.
1b(ii)
). Then, the photocatalytic layer is fabricated by adding hydrophobic silica aerogel (white circle) on top of the nanocomposites. The addition of hydrophobic silica aerogel introduces a Janus structure onto the photocatalytic layer with two contrasting surface properties (top, hydrophobic; bottom, hydrophilic) (Fig.
1b(iii)
). The supporting layer is separately fabricated by following the same process used for the photocatalytic layer, but without incorporating photocatalysts and silica aerogel. Finally, the photocatalytic layer is bonded with the supporting layer using ethanol (EtOH) (Fig.
1b(iv)
). The bonding procedure and seamless interface are shown in Extended Data Fig.
1e–i
.
Material design and characterization of the nanocomposites
The floatability of the nanocomposites (Fig.
2a
) is expected to yield unique features that are advantageous for photocatalysis, such as efficient light delivery and facile gas separation, as well as suppressed back-oxidation of H
2
(ref.
43
). Therefore, for achieving high floatability, the overall density of the nanocomposites is decreased by minimizing the density of photocatalysts (Fig.
2b
). Specifically, we lowered the density of Pt/TiO
2
, the heaviest among all the components, by ~50% by reforming it into cryoaerogel through the flash-freezing technique
44
(Extended Data Fig.
2a
). Electron microscopy and elemental analysis of Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel and Cu-SA/TiO
2
NPs validate their morphology and composition (Extended Data Fig.
2b–k
provides the detailed characterization data). The porous structure of the backbone polymers also contributes to reducing the density of the nanocomposites (Fig.
2c,d
).

Furthermore, a Janus structure with a hydrophilic body and hydrophobic surface was exploited to maximize the floatability by enhancing the surface tension
45
as a facile water supply is maintained. This structure is made by the heterogeneous incorporation of hydrophobic silica aerogel on the surface of the photocatalytic layer (Fig.
2e
). The concentration gradient of the silica aerogel induces a gradual change in hydrophobicity–hydrophilicity in the nanocomposites (Fig.
2f
and Extended Data Fig.
3a
). The floatability can be quantified using the equilibrium density, the density of a solution at which the nanocomposites sink (Extended Data Fig.
3b
). The catalytic layers exhibit a lower floatability than the supporting layers due to heavy catalysts, but their floatability can be improved by adding hydrophobic silica aerogel (Fig.
2g
and Extended Data Fig.
3c
). Meanwhile, the existence of silica aerogel rarely affects the light absorption of the hydrogel nanocomposites (Extended Data Fig.
3d
).
The advantage of the floatable nanocomposites is valid only if the reactant of the catalytic reaction is steadily supplied to the catalytic layer. Since the nanocomposites are composed of elastomer–hydrogel backbone polymers with a porous structure, water—a reactant of the H
2
evolution reaction (HER)—can reach the catalytic components with minimal resistance. The water surface covered by the nanocomposites still exhibited notable evaporation (Extended Data Fig.
3e,f
), and the dye solution reaches the upper layer through the lower layer (Extended Data Fig.
3g
), which confirms the facile mass transfer of water through the nanocomposites (Extended Data Fig.
3e,f
). Hydrogels such as polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel typically show a rapid swelling behaviour
46
, which leads to relatively fast catalyst leaching (Fig.
2h
, left). The HPU–PPG composite provides an effective solution to this problem, achieving long-term material stability and reliable immobilization of the photocatalysts (Fig.
2h,
right, and Extended Data Fig.
3h
) even under harsh environments such as strong alkaline solutions or seawater with organic solvents. In addition, the silica aerogel in the composites exhibits negligible leaching, implying its long-term floatability (Extended Data Fig.
3h
). Unlike a large increase in the volume in the control group (PAM) after two weeks (Fig.
2i
, top), a negligible change was observed in the HPU–PPG composite (Fig.
2i
, bottom), which is consistent with the small swelling ratios (Extended Data Fig.
3i
). Furthermore, the nanocomposites showed little change in their elastic modulus (Fig.
2j
), whereas a notable decrease in elastic modulus was observed in the control group (Fig.
2k
).
H
2
production of the nanocomposites
The photocatalytic H
2
production was measured under the light intensity similar to the air mass (AM) 1.5G condition for the floatable and sunken nanocomposites (Fig.
3a
and Extended Data Fig.
4a
), in which Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel was embedded as a photocatalyst. The sunken nanocomposites were prepared as the control group by adding weight to the floatable nanocomposites to demonstrate the advantage of flotation. The floatable nanocomposites exhibited a twofold increase in the H
2
evolution rate (163 mmol h
–1
m
–2
; data from three samples were averaged), compared with the sunken nanocomposites (77.2 mmol h
–1
m
–2
) (Fig.
3b,c
). Gas chromatography (GC) peaks were monitored during H
2
production (Extended Data Fig.
4b,c
), whose procedure is shown in Supplementary Video
1
(Extended Data Fig.
4d–f
shows the captured images). With an increase in Pt wt% in the Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel, H
2
production is enhanced (Extended Data Fig.
4g–i
) due to the availability of more catalytic centres for proton reduction. Therefore, an optimum concentration of Pt can be chosen according to the desired demand by considering the catalytic activity and fabrication cost. Furthermore, the H
2
evolution rates are dependent on the intensity of simulated sunlight (Extended Data Fig.
4j
), which confirms the influence of light attenuation by water (Extended Data Fig.
4k
) on the HER performance.

To corroborate the result that the floatable nanocomposites enable a more efficient HER, numerical simulations were performed on the floatable and sunken nanocomposites, by taking into account light delivery, gas separation and H
2
back-oxidation (Extended Data Fig.
5a
). The H
2
concentration distribution in the floatable and sunken nanocomposites at various time points (10, 30, 60, 200 and 400 min) after light illumination was numerically simulated (Fig.
3d,e
). The H
2
concentration in air, which is critical to capture the generated H
2
, rapidly increases with time in the case of the floatable nanocomposites (Fig.
3f
), whereas the sunken nanocomposites exhibit a much slower increase in H
2
concentration in air (Fig.
3g
). This is mainly due to the notably lower diffusion coefficient of H
2
in water (5.1 × 10
−9
m
2
s
–1
) than that in air (7.0 × 10
−5
m
2
s
–1
). The tendency of decreasing HER performance with an increase in water depth was also confirmed via numerical simulations (Extended Data Fig.
5b–d
).
The long-term stability of the elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposites allows stable photocatalytic activity during three cycles of HER (Fig.
3h
). A comparison of H
2
evolution performance on day 0, day 7 and day 14 also confirms its long-term stability (Fig.
3i
). This stability is one of the key requirements for commercially viable photocatalytic platforms. Furthermore, the nanocomposites can also be applied to other photocatalysts such as Pt/graphitic carbon nitride NPs (Pt/g-C
3
N
4
NPs) and Cu-SA/TiO
2
NPs (Extended Data Fig.
6
). The floatability and catalytic results of the nanocomposites incorporating Pt/g-C
3
N
4
NPs are shown in Extended Data Fig.
6a–e
. In particular, in addition to photoactivation (Extended Data Fig.
6f
) similar to pristine Cu-SA/TiO
2
NPs (ref.
2
), the Cu-SA/TiO
2
NP nanocomposite exhibits a stable HER performance (Extended Data Fig.
6g
). The floatability and catalytic results of the nanocomposites incorporating Pt/g-C
3
N
4
NPs are shown in Extended Data Fig.
6a–e
. Especially, in addition to photoactivation (Extended Data Fig.
6f
) similar to pristine Cu-SA/TiO
2
NPs (ref.
2
), the Cu-SA/TiO
2
NP nanocomposites exhibit a stable HER performance (Extended Data Fig.
6g
).
Practical applications of the nanocomposites
The stable immobilization of photocatalysts and high durability of nanocomposites resulted in high HER performance even in seawater (Fig.
4a,b
), which is comparable with the HER activity in deionized water (Fig.
3h
). Comparison of H
2
evolution performance on day 0, day 7 and day 14 confirms its long-term stability in the natural seawater environment (Fig.
4b
). The volume change or material degradation of the nanocomposites was not observed with seawater (Extended Data Fig.
7a
).

Furthermore, to mimic highly turbid water conditions that are often found in real environments, two commercial dyes were dissolved in the reaction solution. Since the orange dye (Sudan I) incompletely dissolves in the aqueous solution, the dye agglomerates can act as a scattering centre and hamper light penetration through the solution. The blue dye (Trypan blue) fully dissolves in the aqueous solution, imitating light-absorbing components in real-water conditions. Since the artificial convection force is not applicable in real environments, Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel, a control group representing the conventional photocatalytic platform, was placed at the bottom of the reaction solution (Extended Data Fig.
7b
). Our nanocomposites remained afloat on the dye solutions (Extended Data Fig.
7c
) and showed a negligible reduction in HER activity (Fig.
4c
), whereas the sunken photocatalysts exhibited notably lower photocatalytic performance than the floatable nanocomposites due to light attenuation induced by the dyes (Fig.
4c
). The dyes are not involved in the competitive reactions for HER.
Photoreforming of plastics, which has been regarded as one of the most important photocatalytic reactions as it can produce H
2
together with reducing environmentally problematic plastic waste
47
, to H
2
by the nanocomposites (Fig.
4d,e
) could also be demonstrated due to its high material durability even in a strong alkaline solution (Extended Data Fig.
7d
). The nanocomposites exhibited an H
2
evolution rate of 0.154 l h
–1
m
–2
(3.45 mmol h
–1
m
–2
) for the photoreforming of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The observation of the performance of the device on day 0, day 7 and day 14 confirms its long-term viability (Fig.
4f
and Extended Data Fig.
7e
).
The scale up of the HER platform is highly important for practical applications. The size of the floatable photocatalytic nanocomposites was scaled up in two steps (from 0.00283 to 0.01320 m
2
and then to 1.00000 m
2
) to demonstrate the scalable production of H
2
. First, 11.5 cm × 11.5 cm nanocomposites, in which Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel was used as a photocatalyst, were fabricated (Extended Data Fig.
8a–c
). The nanocomposites were irradiated with simulated solar light and exhibited an H
2
evolution rate of 0.504 l h
–1
m
–2
(11.3 mmol h
–1
m
–2
) under the one-sun intensity condition (Extended Data Fig.
8d–f
).
Next, arrayed nanocomposites with a total area of 1 m
2
were fabricated (Fig.
5a,b
). In these large-scale nanocomposites, Cu-SA/TiO
2
NPs were used as a photocatalyst instead of Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel to demonstrate the economic feasibility of the nanocomposites (Extended Data Fig.
9a–c
). The 1-m
2
-scale nanocomposites can produce 79.2 ml of H
2
per day under natural sunlight irradiation with an average intensity of 0.732 kW m
–2
(Fig.
5c
). Computational simulation of 1-m
2
-scale H
2
production by floatable and sunken nanocomposites corroborates the advantage of floatable nanocomposites (Extended Data Fig.
9d–h
). Also, the computational simulation of H
2
production using the floatable nanocomposites with an area of 100 m
2
presents a possibility for industrial-scale production of H
2
(Fig.
5d–f
and Extended Data Fig.

).

Conclusions
We presented a floatable photocatalytic platform constructed from elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposites, demonstrating its superiority over conventional systems in solar H
2
production. These floatable nanocomposites, located at the air–water interface, dramatically enhance the photocatalytic performance by implementing efficient light delivery, facile gas separation and reduced back-oxidation of H
2
. Consequently, even without the forced convection of water, the floatable photocatalytic nanocomposites exhibit a high H

generation from seawater and the photoreforming of environmentally problematic plastic wastes. These demonstrations of scalability, material durability and photocatalytic activity under various realistic environmental conditions prove the potential of floatable photocatalytic nanocomposites.
However, further developments should be accompanied to realize solar H
2
production at commercial scales using floatable nanocomposites. The development of high-performance photocatalysts and their monolithic integration with nanocomposites are required to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. The utilization of water-splitting catalysts is also needed in consideration of cost and environmental issues. In addition, the HER performance may be improved further through material engineering, such as the implementation of a transparent elastomer–hydrogel hybrid matrix, which facilitates the efficient use of incident light energy. The suggested platform, with future developments, will have a great impact on the industrialization of photocatalysis.

) under vigorous stirring. After 2 h, the product was washed with water and EtOH and dried at 50 °C in an electric oven overnight.
Fabrication of floatable photocatalytic elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposites
To fabricate the photocatalytic layer, 3 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50.0 wt%) was prepared and EtOH was added to set the concentration of HPU as 10.5 wt%. NaCl was added to the HPU solution (final concentration of NaCl, 0.032 g ml
–1
), and 30 mg of photocatalysts was added to the HPU solution. After vigorous stirring, PPG was added to the HPU solution with a volume ratio of 1:2 (PPG:HPU). A mixed sol–gel state was obtained after the addition of PPG, and the gel phase was separated after 24 h. After moulding the gel into a circular shape with a diameter of 6 cm, EtOH and water in the gel phase were removed by drying at 60 °C for two days, and the gel phase was reswollen in water to remove NaCl granules in the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite. The separated gel phase (photocatalytic layer) was fully swollen in water, and hydrophobic silica aerogel was added to the top surface of the photocatalytic layer. The fabrication of a supporting layer follows the same procedures, except starting with 16 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50 wt%) and skipping the addition of photocatalysts. The bilayer system of the nanocomposite was fabricated by integrating the photocatalytic layer and supporting layer with the aid of EtOH. EtOH was added dropwise on the top surface of the supporting layer, and the photocatalytic layer was attached to the supporting layer. The bilayer system was dried at 60 °C for 24 h to remove EtOH and reswollen in water.
Fabrication of PAM nanocomposites
The acrylamide/bis-acrylamide solution (19:1) was added to the as-prepared acrylamide solution (0.156 g ml
–1
). Subsequently, a 10 wt% ammonium persulfate solution was added to the solution. The solution was degassed for 5 min. Then, 30 mg Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel and tetramethylethylenediamine solution were sequentially added. The resulting solution was poured into a circular mould with a diameter of 6 cm, and cured under ultraviolet irradiation for 2 h.
Material characterizations
(1)
Molecular weight analysis of HPU was performed by gel permeation chromatography at the National Instrumentation Center for Environmental Management (NICEM), Seoul National University.
(2)
Transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-2100F) observation was performed at 200 kV. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; Oxford, X-MAX 80T) was operated at 200 kV.
(3)
The absorption spectra of the catalysts were measured using ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (V-770) at the Research Institute of Advanced Materials, Seoul National University. Powder-type photocatalysts were placed on the detection spot. Then, the absorption spectra of the photocatalysts were measured from 200 to 800 nm. The absorption intensity was normalized by dividing the intensity by the maximum absorption intensity.
(4)
The density of the photocatalysts was obtained by calculating the ratio of mass and volume. Since the weight of the photocatalysts underwater is equal to its volume, the volume of the photocatalysts was set as the weight of the photocatalysts in the aqueous solution.
(5)
The cross section of the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss) operated at 2.00 kV at NICEM, Seoul National University. The mass ratio of Si at each point of the cross section of the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite was obtained by EDS (FlatQuad, AURIGA) operated at 11.3 kV at NICEM, Seoul National University.
(6)
The contact angles were measured using a contact angle analyser (KRÜSS, DSA25). A sessile drop method was used at room temperature (20.0 °C) for the measurement.
(7)
The porosity was calculated using the following equation:
\({{{\mathrm{Porosity}}}}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \left( {1 - \frac{{W_\mathrm{d}}}{{W_{\mathrm{fs}}}}} \right) \times 100\)
, where
W
fs
and
W
d
denote the mass of the fully swollen hydrogel sample and mass of the hydrogel sample of which water in the pores was eliminated, respectively.
(8)
The floatability of the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel composite was determined by measuring the equilibrium density. The floatable nanocomposites were located in deionized water (density, 1.000 g ml
–1
), and the pre-calculated amount of acetonitrile (density, 0.786 g ml
–1
) was continuously added to the aqueous solution to control the density of the mixed solution. The equilibrium density was determined as the density of the external solution at which the nanocomposites sink.
(9)
The facile water supply to the elastomer–hydrogel composite without silica aerogel was evaluated by the evaporated amount of water covered with the composite. The evaporated amount was measured by the weight change in the remaining water in the vial for 36 h in the oven. The evaporated amount in an open state and closed state was used as the positive control and negative control, respectively.
(10)
Catalyst leaching was calculated by measuring the Pt concentration in the solution, in which the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite and the PAM composite were contained for 14 days. The Pt concentration was detected using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICPS-8100).
(11)
The swelling ratio was calculated according to the following equation:
\({{{\mathrm{Swelling}}}}\,{{{\mathrm{ratio}}}}\left( {{{{Q}}}} \right) = \frac{{W_{\mathrm{fs}}}}{{W_{\mathrm{fd}}}}\)
, where
W
fs
and
W
fd
denote the mass of the fully swollen hydrogel sample and mass of the fully dried hydrogel sample, respectively.
(12)
The tensile test was conducted to measure the elastic modulus of the bilayer HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite and the PAM composite with a universal testing machine (1 kN load cell, Instron 5543) at the speed of 2.10 mm s
–1
by following a modified version of ISO 527. A bilayer HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite sample with a width of 7 mm, length of 3 mm and thickness of 4 mm was used for the tensile test. The PAM composite sample of the same size was attached to the PET substrate and used for the tensile test.
(13)
Thermal imaging was conducted to measure the surface temperature of the nanocomposites with an infrared camera (685-FLIR-I5, FLIR).
Photocatalytic measurements
General procedure for photocatalytic HER measurements
The photocatalytic HER was conducted in a gas-closed quartz cell reactor. The photocatalytic elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite was floated on the 20% methanol aqueous solution. The closed reaction system was purged with Ar gas for 20 min, and the sample was irradiated with a xenon lamp (MAX-302, Ashai Spectra). Light irradiated on top of the sample with a square-shaped projection (2.6 cm
2
) using a light-guide cable. The light intensity was measured using a detector equipped with a thermophile sensor (919P-003-10, Newport) and fixed at 122 mW cm
–2
. The reaction temperature was maintained at around room temperature using a cooling fan. H
2
generation was quantified using GC (iGC7200A, DS Science) with a thermal conductivity detector. All the other measurement conditions are identical for the sunken Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel and sunken elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite, except that those samples were placed inside the solution.
Photocatalytic HER measurements with two commercial dyes
Approximately 10 mg of Sudan I dye and 5 mg of Trypan blue dye were added to 20% methanol aqueous solution and sonicated for 1 min for each reaction. All the other measurement conditions are the same as the general photocatalytic HER measurements.
Photocatalytic HER measurements with seawater
All the other measurement conditions are the same as the general photocatalytic HER measurements, but deionized water was replaced by the same volume of seawater.
Photocatalytic HER measurements during photoreforming of PET
Pretreatment of PET substrates was performed by soaking the PET in 1 M KOH solution (5 g l
–1
) for seven days at room temperature with stirring at 300 rpm. All the other measurement conditions are the same as the general photocatalytic HER measurement conditions, but the same volume of solubilized PET in 1 M KOH solution was used instead of methanol aqueous solution.
Photocatalytic HER measurements of the nanocomposites with dimensions of 11.5 × 11.5 cm
2
The photocatalytic hydrogel nanocomposite was floated on the 20% methanol aqueous solution inside a quartz cell reactor with dimensions of 14.5 × 14.5 × 5 cm
3
. After complete sealing, the closed reaction system was purged with Ar gas for 1 h, and the sample was irradiated with a solar simulator (ASTM E 927-05, Newport). Then, 100 mW cm
–2
of simulated solar light (AM 1.5G) with square-shaped projection (8.5 × 8.5 cm
2
) was irradiated on the photocatalytic nanocomposite. The amount of produced H
2
was measured using a GC system (iGC7200A, DS Science) with a thermal conductivity detector. The gas extracted from the reaction cell was manually injected into the GC once every hour using a syringe.

3
steel cell reactor. Four quartz windows (51 × 51 cm
2
) were attached to the steel cell. After complete sealing, the closed reaction system was purged with N
2
gas for 6 h, and the samples were irradiated with natural sunlight. Solar light intensity was measured using an energy meter (Nova II, Ophir). The amount of produced H
2
was measured using a GC system (iGC7200A, DS Science) with a thermal conductivity detector.
Numerical simulation
Simulation domain
Extended Data Fig.
7a
shows a schematic of the simulation domain. We constructed a two-dimensional simulation domain with the same length scale as in the experiment. H
2
generation was set as a constant flux of 0.04 mmol h
–1
, in the hydrogel region represented by the red box. In the water region represented by the purple colour, only water exists at first, and H
2
generated in the hydrogel region diffuses to the water region. In the air region above the water region, only air exists at first, and H
2
diffuses to this region. The red dotted line indicates the outlet of the domain, and the open-boundary condition is assigned. We measure distance
d
H
from the bottom to the hydrogel region in the experimental system and apply it to the simulation. Here
d
H
is 1.9 cm in the floatable bilayer system and 0 cm in the sunken bilayer system.
Governing equations
In this study, we describe the diffusion process of H
2
from the hydrogel into water and air. In addition, we consider the reverse reaction of the H
2
formation reaction, which occurs in water. Both diffusion and reverse reactions of H
2
are included in the two-dimensional conservation equation as follows:
$$\frac{{\partial c}}{{\partial t}} = D\nabla ^2c + R,$$
(1)
where
c
is the H
2
concentration,
t
is time and
D
is the diffusion coefficient of H
2
. We set the diffusion coefficient of H
2
as 5 × 10

in water
47
and 0.7 cm
2
s
–1
in air
48
,
49
. Here
R
indicates the reverse reaction rate of H
2
, and we assume the reverse reaction rate is proportional to H
2
concentration, namely,
R
= –
k
r
c
, instead of considering the complex mechanism of the reverse reaction. Here
k
r
, the rate constant of the reverse reaction, is fixed at 1 × 10
−7
s
–1
. The simulation confirmed that the reverse reaction occurred in 1% of the H
2
concentration under the
R
and
k
r
values used in our study. On the other hand, the reverse reaction does not occur in air; therefore,
R
= 0 in air. The two boundary conditions—H
2
generation in the hydrogel region and the open-boundary condition—are expressed as follows:
$$\frac{{\partial c}}{{\partial t}} = D\nabla ^2c + R_{\mathrm{gen}},\,R_{\mathrm{gen}} = 0.04\,{\mathrm{mmol}}\,{\mathrm{h}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{in}}\,{\mathrm{the}}\,{\mathrm{hydrogel}}\,{\mathrm{region}},$$
(2)
$${{{\mathbf{n}}}} \cdot D\nabla c = 0\,{\mathrm{at}}\,{\mathrm{the}}\,{\mathrm{boundary}}\,{\mathrm{of}}\,{\mathrm{interest}}.$$
(3)
In Equation (
3
),
n
indicates the unit outward normal vector at the boundary of interest. The simulation domain is discretized into ~6,000 elements for lab scale, ~100,000 elements for 1 m scale and ~4,000,000 elements for 10-m scale using commercial COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4 software. In addition, the conservation equation is numerically solved based on the finite element method solver in COMSOL. A workstation with two octa-core processors (Intel Xeon E5-2687W CPUs at 3.1 GHz) and 192 GB of memory is used for the numerical calculation.

To fabricate the photocatalytic layer, 16 ml of the HPU solution (HPU in water, 50.0 wt%) was prepared and EtOH was added to set the concentration of HPU to 10.5 wt%. NaCl was added to the HPU solution (concentration of NaCl, 0.032 g ml
–1
), and 230 mg Pt/TiO
2
cryoaerogel was added to the solution. After vigorous stirring, PPG was added to the HPU solution with a volume ratio of 1:2 (PPG:HPU). A mixed sol–gel state was formed after the addition of PPG, and the gel phase was separated after 1 day. After being moulded into an 11.5 × 11.5 cm
2
square, the gel phase was dried at 60 °C for 2 days to remove EtOH and water, and reswollen in water to remove the NaCl granules in the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite. The separated gel phase (photocatalytic layer) was fully swollen in water, and hydrophobic silica aerogel was added to the top surface of the photocatalytic layer. The fabrication of a supporting layer follows the same procedures, except starting with 90 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50 wt%) and skipping the addition of Pt/TiO

2
The nanocomposites in an area of 1 m
2

. To fabricate the photocatalytic layer of a single unit, 90 ml of the HPU solution (HPU in water, 50.0 wt%) was prepared and EtOH was added to set the concentration of HPU as 10.5 wt%. NaCl was added to the HPU solution (concentration of NaCl, 0.032 g ml
–1
), and 90 mg of Cu-SA/TiO
2
NPs was added to the solution. After vigorous stirring, PPG was added to the HPU solution with a volume ratio of 1:2 (PPG:HPU). A mixed sol–gel state was formed after the addition of PPG, and the gel phase was separated after 1 day. After being moulded into a 25 × 25 cm
2
square, the gel phase was dried at 60 °C for 2 days to remove EtOH and water, and reswollen in water to remove NaCl granules in the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite. The separated gel phase (photocatalytic layer) was fully swollen in water, and hydrophobic silica aerogel was added to the top surface of the photocatalytic layer. The fabrication of a supporting layer of a single unit follows the same procedures, except starting with 350 ml of the HPU solution (HPU in water, 50 wt%) and skipping the addition of Cu-SA/TiO
2
NPs. The bilayer system of the nanocomposite was fabricated by integrating the photocatalytic layer and supporting layer with the aid of EtOH. EtOH was added dropwise on the top surface of a supporting layer, and a photocatalytic layer was attached to the supporting layer. The bilayer system was dried at 60 °C for 1 day to remove EtOH and reswollen in water.
