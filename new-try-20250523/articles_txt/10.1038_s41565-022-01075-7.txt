Abstract
Single-atom catalysts have recently attracted considerable attention because of their highly efficient metal utilization and unique properties. Finding a green, facile method to synthesize them is key to their widespread commercialization. Here we show that single-atom catalysts (including iron, cobalt, nickel and copper) can be prepared via a top-down abrasion method, in which the bulk metal is directly atomized onto different supports, such as carbon frameworks, oxides and nitrides. The level of metal loading can be easily tuned by changing the abrasion rate. No synthetic chemicals, solvents or even water were used in the process and no by-products or waste were generated. The underlying reaction mechanism involves the mechanochemical force in situ generating defects on the supports, then trapping and stably sequestering atomized metals.

Main
Single-atom catalysts (SACs), isolated individual metal atoms stably anchored onto supports, allow up to 100% of the metal to be catalytically utilized. The strong metal–support interaction and quantum size effects lead to exceptionally distinct chemical, physical and electronic properties relative to nanoparticles and bulk metals

. Accordingly, finding a simple, low-cost, eco-friendly and scalable approach to synthesize SACs is highly desirable.
SACs are typically synthesized using bottom-up methods, employing a synthetic metal salt/complex, and nitrogen- and/or carbon-containing organic compounds as the raw materials (Fig.
1a
). Water or an organic liquid is used as the supporting solvent. A thermal reduction is also required to transform the metal salts into single atoms. The bottom-up process inevitably generates by-products, including salts and liquid/gaseous molecules, which require further rinsing with solvents

. Although several works claim that ball-milling can eliminate the need for solvent by physically mixing metal salts with support, this method requires several steps and produces hazardous wastes (Fig.

as precursors—making them costly and environmentally unfriendly. Preparation of SACs using widely available bulk elementary materials offers a low-cost and eco-friendly solution. Qu et al. used ammonia gas as a corrosion agent to transform bulk copper into copper complexes that can then be deposited on a support to produce a SAC. The limited choice of supports available and thermal deposition also restrict the scalability of SACs
24
.
In this Article, we report a facile and eco-friendly top-down mechanochemical abrasion method for direct synthesis of SACs from bulk metals, nitrogen gas (N
2
) and graphite as precursors (Fig.
1c
). No synthetic chemicals or solvents (including water) are used in the preparation process and therefore no by-products or waste are generated. Because kinetic energy is the driving force of the reaction, the processing cost can be further reduced by directly using natural sources of kinetic energy, such as wind or hydro power. In some cases, mild thermal treatment can further enhance the ratio of single atoms (from 75% to 96% for the Fe–N–C system) and render the SACs more thermodynamically stable. Because one metal cluster equals tens of single atoms, these clusters are so scarce as to be very difficult to detect by morphological characterization methods. It should be noted that thermal purification is not always required depending on the system; for example, thermal treatment is not required for single atoms of iron on SiO
2
. The concentration of single atoms can be easily tuned by altering the abrasion parameters. The underlying mechanisms were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which show that the large binding energy between the metal and the support facilitates the formation of SACs. We also extended our method to synthesize SACs on supports such as oxides and nitrides.
Preparation method for SACs using abrasion
Any mechanical movement that can give rise to abrasion between metal and support, such as friction, grinding and ball-milling, works in this experiment. Here we adopted the ball-milling method, which is often described as a commercially mature technique. Traditional ball-milling uses physical mixing, whereas our method uses mechanochemical reactions. For the synthesis of SACs, traditional ball-milling generally involves mechanical mixing of metal salts and support, whereas our method mechanochemically abrades bulk metal into single atoms.
To prepare single-atom metal–N–C, we used the corresponding elementary substances of each element as the raw materials (
Supplementary Notes
), that is, bulk metal balls, N
2
gas and graphite. These materials are environmentally friendly and readily available. The metal atomization, N
2
fixation and graphite unzipping are achieved simultaneously by a one-step ball-milling method (Supplementary Tables
1
and
2
). Here the metal balls are not only the source of the atomized metal, but also transmit kinetic energy to drive the reactions. The atomization of the metal balls occurs via an atomic-scale abrasion. N
2
gas provides the nitrogen, which is incorporated into the graphitic framework and anchors the metal atoms. The N
2
gas is dissociated via a catalytic process on the activated surfaces of the metal balls, promoted by cyclic strain engineering
25
. The graphite is unzipped by the kinetic energy delivered by the metal balls and serves as an active matrix to accommodate the nitrogen and atomized metal. The method can be readily scaled-up by simply increasing the volume of the ball-mill container.
Characterizations
We have synthesized SACs of Fe–N–C, Co–N–C, Ni–N–C and Cu–N–C. We describe the results from the Fe–N–C system as a representative example for the following reasons: (1) the chemical states of iron can be characterized with ultrahigh resolution by Mössbauer spectroscopy; and (2) the single-atom nature of the iron on the carbon support can be definitively determined due to the absence of magnetism in single atoms of iron.
To directly image the single atoms, high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was utilized. The single iron atoms are readily visible as bright spots on the surface of graphitic nanoparticles (GNPs) because of their higher atomic mass compared to carbon and nitrogen (Fig.
2a
). The results clearly suggest that single atoms are formed.

The overall iron loading determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was found to be
∼
1.10 ± 0.03 wt% (Supplementary Table
2
), but the surface of individual GNPs was found to be nearly fully covered with single atoms. The main reason is that single atoms are only distributed on the surface of GNPs because of atomization by top-down abrasion. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
1a
) confirmed the existence of iron.
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Supplementary Fig.
1b
) indicated that there were no peaks from particulate iron in all samples. Only the graphite (002) and (101) facets were present. However, clusters and/or amorphous iron phases cannot be detected by X-ray diffraction, and therefore we employed low-resolution HADDF-STEM (Supplementary Fig.
1c
) to confirm that there were no visible iron particles on the surface of the GNPs.
The characteristics of the single atoms were verified by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The radial distribution function (RDF) derived from EXAFS results is shown in Fig.
2b
. The main bonding of the original sample located at around 1.5 Å (refs.
26
,
27
,
28
) is attributed to Fe–N/C. There is a small shoulder at 2.2 Å that corresponds to Fe–Fe bonding. This indicates that very small amounts of iron carbide clusters may be present in the sample. After carefully checking tens of HAADF-STEM images (Supplementary Fig.
1d
), the clusters were found to have a typical size of less than 1 nm.
The chemical state of the sample was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary Fig.
2a,b
). However, the Fe 2
p
signal did not provide any valuable information due to poor resolution. The Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) results confirmed that the chemical state of iron was a mixture of Fe
II
and Fe
III
(Supplementary Fig.
2c
).
We also performed Mössbauer spectroscopy, one of the most powerful techniques for characterizing iron with ultrahigh sensitivity (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Table
3
). The Mössbauer spectroscopy deconvolution results indicated that the doublets D1, D2 and D3 can be attributed to low-, intermediate- and high-spin Fe

. The results indicated that after abrasion the single atoms constituted approximately 75% of the original sample, and the clusters were identified as a short-range-ordered Fe

C (sextet S1, 25%).
Role of heat treatment on Fe–N–C SAC
We have found that additional heat treatment can be beneficial for improving thermal stability and increasing the fraction of SACs by transforming the occasionally formed metal clusters into single atoms. After heat treatment, the absence of iron-related peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern (Supplementary Fig.
2d
) indicates that the iron atoms still maintain the single-atom state and no aggregation occurs. The disappearance of the shoulder in the RDF (Fig.
2b
) implies that the Fe
3
C clusters have been transformed into single atoms. This phenomenon of heating bulk metal into single atoms is consistent with recently reported works
22
,
23
,
24
. Careful analysis of the Mössbauer spectroscopy (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Table
3
) indicates only 4% untransformed clusters, which correspond to Fe
3
C (the minor sextet S1) after phase transition. In addition to S1, the doublets D1 and D5 also decrease; however, the doublets D2, D3 and D4 increase. These changes are thought to be intimately related to the transformations and ordering arrangements after heat treatment.
The chemical state is also slightly altered due to the heat treatment. The XPS and XANES (Supplementary Fig.
2b, c
) shift to higher energy due to the transformation from Fe
3
C to single atoms. It is interesting to find that the atomic images of the samples after heat treatment are always clearer than those without heat treatment (Supplementary Fig.
3
). This phenomenon may be associated with easily adsorbing gas molecules of the samples without heat treatment.
Abrasion kinetics
The content and morphology of the iron can be facilely tuned by changing the input kinetic energy, graphite loading and ball-milling time. After dozens of experiments, some general rules were determined. It was established that the input kinetic energy and loading of graphite mainly influence the morphology of the iron. Lower input kinetic energy (using smaller iron balls and lower rotation speeds) and higher graphite loading are beneficial to the single-atom state. The ball-milling time mainly determines iron loading, but does not influence the morphology of the iron unless a critical value of loading is exceeded.
A mathematical analysis (Supplementary Fig.
4a–c
) determined that the iron content (
W
) in Fe–N–C is proportional to the cube of the input kinetic energy, that is,
W
∝
(
mω
2
)
3
, where
m
and
ω
stand for mass and rotation speed, respectively. Graphite loading (
L
) can also influence
W
because graphite acts as a lubricant, which can reduce abrasion.
W
exponentially decreases as
L
increases (
W
∝
e
−
L
) (Supplementary Fig.
4d,e
).
W
increases when the ball-milling time is prolonged, but the effect is not linear. Possible reasons are that
W
is influenced by nitrogen content and the state of the graphite (Supplementary Fig.
4f
).
Extension to cobalt, nickel, copper and brass
We also extend our method to other metals (Supplementary Fig.
5
), which are not limited to cobalt, nickel and copper. All metals that can form a stable bond with supports should work. As shown in Fig.
2e
, Supplementary Fig.
6
and Supplementary Table
4
, the RDFs demonstrate that cobalt, nickel and copper exist in the single-atom state. Their morphologies are shown in Supplementary Fig.
7
, further confirming the single-atom state.
In addition to unary metal balls, alloy balls can also be used to fabricate bimetallic catalysts. We selected brass balls (66 wt% Cu + 34 wt% Zn) as an example (Supplementary Fig.
8a,b
). HAADF-STEM images (Supplementary Fig.
8c,d
) demonstrate the brass alloy has been transformed into single atoms. RDFs (Fig.
2f
and Supplementary Fig.
8e,f
) further verify that the copper and zinc exist in single-atom states.
Theoretical analysis
In the samples without nitrogen, the N
2
gas simply acts as a protective gas to prevent oxidation. However, the N
2
plays an important role when the support is nitrogen-free graphite. We next designed a control experiment to investigate the role of N
2
. Using samples with a similar iron loading (2.4 wt%), we replaced N
2
with argon. The as-prepared Fe–C displayed a distinctly different morphology. The GNPs were fully decorated with small iron particles with a size of approximately 10 nm (Supplementary Fig.
9
). This result indicates that the nitrogen in the GNPs plays a pivotal role in the morphology of the prepared iron. The nitrogen might suppress the aggregation of single iron atoms into particles.
The underlying physical nature of why single-atom iron is formed during the ball-milling process, and why the iron particles can be transformed into single atoms, has remained unclear. To unravel these questions, a DFT analysis was conducted (Supplementary Table
5
). It is known that repeated collisions of iron balls transform mechanical energy into structural disordering and induce surface defects
31
. The activated iron surface not only acts as a catalyst for nitrogen dissociation
25
, but also supplies iron to form the Fe–N–C. Compared with other metals, the adatoms on the iron balls are easily peeled off by the nitrogen-doped GNPs because of the high segregation energy (Δ
E
seg
, −4.3 eV, Fig.
3
) due to the strong Fe–N bond. The α-Fe (Supplementary Fig.
10a
) and Fe
3
C (Supplementary Fig.
10b
) particles are also capable of transforming into single-atom states due to exothermic processes with Δ
E
seg
of −3.3 eV and −2.8 eV, respectively. The transformed iron atoms migrate away from the defects by a hopping mechanism
32
,
33
. The nitrogen atoms play a pivotal role by subsequently trapping the iron atoms. When the nitrogen atoms are lost at high temperature, the surface energy will dominate again and the iron particles will reform.

Conclusions
We report a facile, solvent-free, zero-waste and low-cost method to prepare SACs. As-prepared single-atom metal–N–C catalysts showed competitive oxygen reduction reaction performance relative to commercial Pt@C (Supplementary Fig.
11
). Our strategy is not only applicable for metal–N–C systems (in which the metal can be iron, cobalt, nickel, copper or their alloys), but can also be easily extended to other supports. To demonstrate this, we also successfully synthesized SACs on some typical supports used in heterogeneous catalysis, such as oxides (MgO, SiO

and CeO

and Supplementary Fig.

Methods
Preparation method for single-atom Fe–N–C
A facile top-down method was used to synthesize single-atom Fe–N–C. The iron atomization, N
2
fixation and graphite unzipping were simultaneously achieved on a planetary ball-milling machine (Pulverisette 6, Fritsch). In typical experiments, 500 g of iron balls (hardened steel with 99 wt% Fe; diameter, 5 mm), 8 bar N
2
gas (KOSEM, ultrahigh purity, 99.999%, N50) and graphite (16.5 g, Alfa Aesar, 100 mesh, 99.9995%) were loaded into a hardened steel container (250 ml). Before charging with N
2
gas, the air in the container was first purged with N
2
gas at least five times with a vacuum pump. During ball-milling, the rotation was paused for 10 min after every 60 min milling to release the thermal heat. After ball-milling, the remnant N
2
gas in the container was vented, first at ambient environment; then the samples were collected in the glovebox. In the optimized experiment, the ball-milling was conducted at a rotation speed of 450 r.p.m. for 30 h. Safety note: samples with high iron content, that is, prepared with less than 10 g graphite loading, or when ball-milling time is longer than 10 h, require special attention because they can spark violently during collection. The container must be opened in the glovebox.
Studying the abrasion parameters
Fe–N–C was selected as a representative example. The rotation speed was set at 350, 400, 450 or 500 r.p.m. The ball-milling time ranged from 3 to 40 h. When the ball-milling time was longer than 10 h, the N
2
charging was performed several times, depending on the total ball-milling time, to ensure sufficient N
2
gas. The graphite loading was 5, 10, 15, 16.5 or 20 g.
Preparation method for single-atom Co–N–C
In the optimized experiment, 500 g of cobalt balls (99.8 wt%; diameter, 5 mm), 8 bar N
2
gas (KOSEM, 99.999%) and 16.5 g of graphite (Alfa Aesar, 100 mesh, 99.9995%) were loaded into a zirconium dioxide container (250 ml). The ball-milling was conducted at a rotation speed of 350 r.p.m. for 22 h. Finally, the as-prepared samples were heat-treated at 850 °C for 5 h.
Preparation method for single-atom Ni–N–C
In the optimized experiment, 540 g of nickel balls (99.95 wt%; diameter, 5 mm), 8 bar N
2
gas (KOSEM, 99.999%) and 15.5 g of graphite (Alfa Aesar, 100 mesh, 99.9995%) were loaded into a zirconium dioxide container (250 ml). The ball-milling was conducted at a rotation speed of 350 r.p.m. for 15 h. Finally, the as-prepared samples were heat treated at 850 °C for 5 h.
Preparation method for single-atom Cu–N–C
In the optimized experiment, 570 g of copper balls (99.9 wt%; diameter, 3 mm, 570 g), 8 bar N
2
gas (KOSEM, 99.999%) and 14.8 g of graphite (Alfa Aesar, 100 mesh, 99.9995%) were loaded into a zirconium dioxide container (250 ml). The ball-milling was conducted at a rotation speed of 340 r.p.m. for 12 h. Finally, the as-prepared samples were heat treated at 600 °C for 5 h.
Preparation method for single-atom Cu,Zn–N–C
In the optimized experimental condition, 55 g of brass balls (66 wt% Cu, 34 wt% Zn; diameter, 3 mm), 8 bar N
2
gas (KOSEM, 99.999%) and 15.0 g of graphite (Alfa Aesar, 100 mesh, 99.9995%) were loaded into a zirconium dioxide container (250 ml). The ball-milling was conducted at a rotation speed of 400 r.p.m. for 15 h. Finally, the as-prepared samples were heat treated at 750 °C for 5 h.
Preparation method for single-atom Fe–MgO
In the optimized experiment, 500 g of iron balls (hardened steel with 99 wt% Fe; diameter, 5 mm), 8 bar N
2
gas (KOSEM, 99.999%) and 35.0 g of MgO (Alfa Aesar, extra pure, 100 mesh, 98%) were loaded into a hardened steel container (250 ml). The ball-milling was conducted at a rotation speed of 200 r.p.m. for 13 h.

Characterizations
Low-magnification morphology was obtained with field emission scanning electron microscopy (Nova NanoSEM, FEI) and normal transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100, JEOL). High-resolution atomic morphology was obtained with spherical-aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM (Titan G2 60-300, FEI). Energy-dispersive spectroscopy was performed with an EDAX system (AMETEK) on a Nano230 field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI). X-ray diffraction patterns were measured on a D/max2500V (Rigaku) at a scan rate of 4° min
−1
, using Cu Kα radiation (
λ
= 1.5418 Å).
Nitrogen contents in the carbon-based samples were determined by elemental analysis, performed on a TruSpec Micro CHNS (LECO). All data were the average value of at least three separate measurements. The metal content was determined by ICP-OES (700-ES, Varian). For the carbon-based samples, calcination was conducted before the ICP-OES analysis. Because some samples only had trace iron, to minimize measurement error, a significant number of samples were used for calcination analyses. The amount was determined based on the metal content when enough metal oxide products were obtained after calcination. Typically, the masses of the samples ranged from 200 to 1,500 mg. The chemical state was studied by XPS (K-alpha XPS spectrometer, Thermo Fisher).
X-ray absorption spectroscopy was performed at the 6D UNIST-PAL beamline in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), South Korea. The data were analyzed by ATHENA
34
. XANES spectra simulations were carried out based on the optimized models, considering the core–hole corrections. Mössbauer spectra were recorded with a Topologic 500A spectrometer (Topologic Systems) and a proportional counter at room temperature. A 50 mCi
57
Co (Rh) was used as a γ-ray radioactive source in constant-acceleration mode. Isomer shifts were calibrated with respect to α-Fe at room temperature.
Computational methods
The CASTEP program in the Materials Studio package (Accelrys) was used to conduct the DFT calculations

. A Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof-type gradient-corrected exchange-correlation potential with ultrasoft pseudopotentials was employed. A cut-off energy of 400 eV was used for the plane-wave basis set. The atomic configurations were relaxed for residual forces smaller than 0.03 eV Å
−1
. To avoid interaction between periodic images, a vacuum thickness of around 15 Å was set along the
z
direction. Transition states were determined by a complete linear synchronous transit/quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) approach.
The segregation energy Δ
E
seg
is given by equation (
1
):
$${\Delta}E_{{{{\mathrm{seg}}}}} = E_{{{\mathrm{S}}}} - E_{{{{\mathrm{P}}}}\,{{{\mathrm{or}}}}\,{{{\mathrm{B}}}}}$$
(1)
where
E
S
is the energy of the atomic structure with one iron atom transformed into a single atom, while
E
P or B
is the energy of the iron particle or of the bulk iron together with nitrogen-doped graphene.
