Abstract
Transition-metal-catalysed carbenoid insertion of hydroxyl groups represents a robust and versatile method to forge C–O bonds. Achieving site-selective functionalization of alcohols using this transformation has undoubted synthetic value but remains challenging. Here we report a strategy for selective carbenoid O–H insertion that exploits an engineered heterogeneous iridium single-atom catalyst, thus providing opportunities for organic transformations by merging material science and catalysis. This catalytic protocol delivers excellent selectivities (up to 99:1) for the functionalization of aliphatic over phenolic O–H bonds, whereas the analogous homogeneous catalyst, Ir(ttp)COCl (ttp = 5,10,15,20-tetra-
p
-tolylporphyrinato), provided modest preferences. Density-functional-theory calculations suggest that the site-selectivity derives from the lower oxidation state of the iridium metal centre in the heterogeneous catalyst and its impact on the absorption energies of the reactants. These results showcase an example of a heterogeneous single-atom catalyst providing superior site-selectivity and provide a complementary strategy to address challenges in catalysis for organic synthesis.

. The combination of a diverse set of transition metals and ligands is often the key to controlling the range of reactivity afforded by these intermediates and to leveraging their potential in the syntheses of pharmaceuticals and natural products.
Along with these advances, enantioselective carbenoid insertion of O–H bonds
4
has also been well-established. In contrast, only a few methods to realize site-selective O–H insertion among various hydroxyl groups have been reported
24
,
25
. This challenge plausibly arises from the reactivity of the electron-withdrawing group typically present in the carbene intermediates, which further enhances the high electrophilicity of these species and renders control of site-selective insertion of a nucleophilic hydroxyl group difficult
3
. Notably, a selective O–H insertion of glycosides has been reported by Tang and co-workers; however, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that site selectivity and stereoselectivity are induced by the axial substituent adjacent to the reactive O–H moiety
25
. Encouraged by the high synthetic values of carbenoid insertion, we sought to explore single-atom-site (SAS) catalysts to promote and control these reactions with the goal of assessing this catalytic system as an opportunity to address the aforementioned challenge of selectivity.
SAS catalysts have emerged as a versatile class of materials and are gaining attention in catalysis applications. Chemical modulation of the SAS support is often essential to achieve high catalytic reactivity

The well-defined structure and coordination environment of the transition metal, in SAS catalysts, can lead to alternative modes of reactivity and provide opportunities to achieve chemo- and regioselective reactions.

The vast majority of effort in this area has focused on the identification of potential SAS catalysts that give better reactivity than the corresponding transition metal nanoparticle- or cluster-based catalysts
28
,
35
. In contrast, studies aimed at discerning the selectivity differences between SAS and analogous homogeneous catalysts are rare
56
. In this respect, we were encouraged to evaluate the potential of SAS materials as a platform for the development of heterogenized homogeneous catalysts with the potential to access distinct selectivity in organic transformation. More specifically, in this article we describe the development of a designed iridium single-atom (Ir-SA) heterogeneous catalyst and compare its performance with its analogous homogeneous catalyst in carbenoid O–H insertions. Our SAS catalyst delivered excellent selectivities for carbenoid insertion into aliphatic O–H bonds, and the origin of this site selectivity was investigated by kinetic studies and DFT calculations.
Results
Synthesis and characterization of Ir-SA
The fabrication process for the Ir-SA catalyst is schematically presented in Fig.
1a
. Zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), dispersed uniformly in methanol solution, was introduced into a solution containing iridium(
iv
) chloride and the monomer poly(cyclotriphospazene-co-4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS). Subsequently, trimethylamine-initiated polymerization of the poly(cyclotriphospazene-co-4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol) and iridium(
iv
) precursors on the surface of ZIF-8 produced the ZIF-8/Ir@PZS composites. As depicted in Supplementary Fig.
1
, the ZIF-8/Ir@PZS structure with a polyhedral morphology was obtained. Finally, the Ir-SA catalyst was supported on heteroatom-doped carbon by pyrolysis of ZIF-8/Ir@PZS at 950 °C under an argon atmosphere.

The sharp contrast between the edge and the centre in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images of this Ir-SA catalyst provided direct insight into the hollow interior (Fig.
1b,c
and Supplementary Fig.
2
) and support for the fact that the morphology of Ir-SA catalyst remains uniformly hollow. HAADF-STEM shows that no obvious metallic Ir nanoparticles were formed during the synthesis of the supported Ir-SA catalyst. Consistent with the HAADF-STEM results, the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of Ir-SA catalyst showed one broad peak located at about 25°, consistent with graphitic carbon, and no detectable metallic Ir nanoparticle signals (Supplementary Fig.
3
). The Ir content of the Ir-SA catalyst was found to be 2.20 wt% by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy images of Ir-SA catalyst established that Ir, N, P, S and C were evenly dispersed throughout the hollow layer (Fig.
1d
). Moreover, aberration-corrected (AC) HAADF-STEM analysis revealed the dispersion state of iridium species at the atomic scale. As illustrated in Fig.
1e,f
, some individual bright dots, labelled with yellow circles, were clearly distinguished from the heteroatom-doped carbon support without any agglomeration, consistent with the existence of single Ir atoms in the Ir-SA catalyst. The atomic dispersion of iridium species in Ir-SA catalyst was confirmed by the analysis of intensity profiles (Fig.
1g
). In addition, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (604.0 m
2
g
-1
) and pore size distribution (~0.5 nm) of the Ir-SA catalyst were calculated (Supplementary Fig.
13
), indicating that heterogeneous Ir-SA possesses a porous structure with a large surface area that provides access to the Ir-SA active sites.
To further establish the chemical state of C, N, P and S in Ir-SA catalyst, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
4
, four peaks at binding energies of 284.8 eV (C=C), 288.1 eV (C–N), 285.7 eV (C–P) and 284.6 eV (C–S) for the C 1
s
spectrum were fitted. The N 1
s
spectrum displays four peaks located at 398.6, 400.6, 401.2 and 403.8 eV, attributed to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and pyridinic N
+
–O
−
, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
5
). The presence of two peaks at binding energies of 132.5 and 133.8 eV in the P 2
p
spectrum indicate the existence of P–C and P–O, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
6
). As shown in the XPS spectrum of the S 2
p
spectrum, three peaks at 168.4, 165.4 and 163.9 eV, associated with 2
p
3/2
, 2
p
1/2
splitting of the S 2
p
spin orbital (–C–S–C–) and oxidized S 2
p
3/2
, respectively, were simulated (Supplementary Fig.
7
). Taken together, these results are most consistent with the conclusion that N, P and S species were doped into the hollow carbon substrate.
Atomic structure analysis of Ir-SA
X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were carried out to examine the atomic dispersion and geometric configuration of the Ir-SA catalyst. As shown in Fig.
2a
, only one intensity maximum peak located at approximately 1.6 Å was examined in the Fourier transform (FT) extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) curve for Ir-SA. This signal was attributed to the contribution of Ir–N coordination. Comparison with the Ir powder, which displayed a main peak at approximately 2.5 Å assigned to the Ir–Ir bond, found that this metallic interaction was not present in the synthesized Ir-SAs, consistent with the existence of single Ir atoms. Further, wavelet transform (WT) analysis, a powerful tool for discriminating backscattering atoms with high resolution in both
k
and
R
space, was performed to investigate the atomic dispersion of Ir. For Ir powder, one intensity maximum was detected at about 8.3 Å
−1
due to Ir–Ir coordination (Fig.
2b
). The WT plots of Ir-SA exhibited only one intensity maximum at 4.0 Å
−
1
, without any other signals similar to those in the WT plots of iridium powder (Fig.
2b
). The above results further support the conclusion that the catalyst is primarily composed of single Ir atoms. The white-line peak, located between those of Ir and IrO
2
in the Ir L
3
-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) curve (Fig.
2c
) of the Ir-SA catalyst suggests that the Ir single atoms in Ir-SA carry an average oxidation state. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
15
, a more reliable quantitative analysis on the valence state was established from the integrated area of the white line peak. The resulting average oxidation state of Ir in Ir-SA is approximately 2.1, which is lower than the previously reported formal oxidation state of the Ir(
iii
) homogeneous catalyst
57
,
58
. A least-squares EXAFS fitting was carried out to obtain quantitative structural parameters of the Ir atoms in the Ir-SA catalyst. The EXAFS fitting parameters are listed in Supplementary Table
1
and the fitting curves are depicted in Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Figs.
8
–
12
. The main peak of the Ir-SA at approximately 1.6 Å originates from the first shell of Ir-SA–N scattering. Together with further analysis (Supplementary Fig.
14
–
16
and Tables
2
and
3
) and DFT modelling (Supplementary Figs.
17
and
39
), the optimized geometric configuration of the Ir-SA catalyst (inset of Fig.
2d
) was determined to possess a Ir single atom anchored to the heteroatom-doped carbon support through fourfold coordinated N atoms.

Reaction scope and selectivity
Having established the composition and structure of a synthesized heterogeneous Ir-SA catalyst, this material was studied as a catalyst for a reaction typically associated with homogeneous transition metal catalysis. First, heterogeneous Ir-SA-catalysed carbenoid insertion of alcohol
2a
with diazo ester
1a
was examined (Fig.
3a
). Ir-SA with only 1 mol% catalyst loading exhibited excellent reactivity, affording
3aa
in 90% yield. Next, the scope of both the diazo reagents and the coupling nucleophilic partners in the Ir-SA-catalysed carbenoid insertion was examined. Notably, various electronically different substituents at the aryl groups of diazo (
1b
–
1d
) were well tolerated, affording the corresponding O–H insertion products (
3ba
–
3da
) in good to excellent yields. Alcohols bearing aryl moieties and aliphatic substituents such as cyclohexyl, trifluoromethyl, chloro or silyl ether functional groups were also amenable (
3ab
–
3aj
), demonstrating the synthetic potential of this heterogeneous catalytic system. In addition, carbenoid insertion reactions into the N–H bond of aniline and the C–H bond of 4-methylindole, respectively, were also tested and generated
3ak
and
3al
in excellent yields.

Given both the structural and electronic similarity between our engineered Ir-SA catalyst and the porphyrin-based homogeneous complex Ir(ttp)COCl (ttp = tetra-(
p
-tolyl)-porphyrin), a direct comparison of the selectivity in O–H carbenoid insertion reactions catalysed by these two catalysts was sought (Fig.
3b
). In this context, carbenoid insertion of 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol
2m
, bearing phenolic C(
sp
2
)O–H and aliphatic C(
sp
3
)O–H, with diazo
1a
was chosen as the model reaction (Supplementary Fig.
21
). Interestingly, homogeneous Ir(ttp)COCl gave an unselective mixture (~50:50) of both mono and bis insertion products (
3am
and
3am″
, respectively), whereas heterogeneous Ir-SA provided extraordinary selectivity (99%) towards mono insertion of C(
sp
3
)-OH. Similarly, other substrates bearing two hydroxyl group (
2n
–
2r
) also showed high selectivities (up to 99%) towards either the benzylic or less hindered hydroxyl group. In addition, the heterogeneous Ir-SA-catalysed carbenoid insertion of
2s
, bearing N–H and O–H functional groups, gave the product with excellent selectivity (99%) in favour of the insertion into the N–H moiety.
To evaluate the potential of this catalyst platform for reuse, the structure of the catalyst reisolated after the reaction was complete was analysed by TEM, HAADF-STEM and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS and XANES). The electron microscopy experiments showed isolated Ir atoms (bright points) and no obvious nanoparticle aggregation was detected, suggesting that the atomic dispersion of iridium species was still preserved after the catalytic reaction (Supplementary Fig.
19
). Moreover, the L
3
-edge
k
3
-weighted FT spectra of the used Ir-SA and fresh Ir-SA showed a single major peak in the EXAFS spectra at ~1.80 Å and ~1.60 Å, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
20
and Table
4
). No Ir–Ir signals were observed in either the freshly prepared Ir-SA or used Ir-SA catalysts. These observations further support the conclusion that the atomic dispersion of the iridium is maintained during the catalytic reaction. Finally, the Ir L
3
-edge XANES curve suggests that the average oxidation state of the Ir atoms in the used Ir-SA catalyst is only slightly higher than the average oxidation state of the Ir atoms in the original Ir-SA catalyst (Supplementary Fig.
20a
).
Taken together, these observations suggest that the Ir-SA catalyst maintains its structure and can be recovered and reused. In the event, recycled catalyst lost some activity (from 99% to 67% conversion over 16 h). Given that the TEM and XAFS studies suggest that the Ir atoms in the reused catalyst retain nearly identical structure to the fresh catalyst, a hot filtration test was performed to examine whether leaching of the Ir-SA catalyst led to the observed decrease in activity (Supplementary Fig.
18
). After conducting catalysis with both model substrates
1a
and
2m
over 1 h, the Ir-SA catalyst was removed by filtration. The resulting clear filtrate was stirred further for 11 h, yielding (from 1% to 10%) the double insertion adduct
3am″
without formation of additional
3am
(Supplementary Fig.
18
). These results are consistent with the leaching of small amounts of iridium, which catalysed the unselective reaction. Moreover, inductively coupled plasma analysis of fresh Ir-SA and used Ir-SA showed a small decrease in iridium content from 2.20 to 2.01 wt%, further supporting that leaching of iridium from the catalyst is limited. Nevertheless, the high selectivity of the reaction observed prior to filtration supports the hypothesis that the majority of the reaction occurred at the single-atom sites of the heterogeneous Ir-SA catalyst.
Mechanistic studies
DFT calculations, assessing both reaction energies and activation barriers, were performed to gain insight into the origin of the selectivity difference between heterogeneous Ir-SA and homogeneous Ir(ttp)COCl. A series of elementary steps, including formation of iridium carbene (C=Ir) intermediate (see Supplementary Figs.
40
and
41
for further details) and subsequent O–H insertion, have been taken into account. To simplify the DFT analysis, Ir–porphyrin, which has only a slight difference (0.07 eV) in carbene (C
6
H
5
CCOOCH
3
) adsorption energy compared with Ir(ttp)COCl, was chosen for these studies (Supplementary Fig.
33
and Table
5
). At the outset of calculation, both concerted and stepwise paths for the carbenoid O–H insertion reaction were examined. The concerted mechanism showed lower activation barriers for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst systems (Supplementary Fig.
36
). Next, the free energy landscape for the reaction catalysed by the heterogeneous Ir-SA catalyst, created by decomposition of diazo
1a
to form C=Ir carbene intermediate followed by selective O–H insertion, was examined (Fig.
4a
; see Supplementary Fig.
34
for further details). Notably, the difference in the activation barriers for the insertion of C(
sp
3
)O–H (0.21 eV) and C(
sp
2
)O–H (0.65 eV) into the C=Ir intermediate is consistent with the selective formation of
3am
over
3am′
. Moreover, the second insertion into C(
sp
2
)O–H of
3am
was calculated to proceed through a transition state with even higher energy (0.74 eV), thus impeding the production of
3am″
(Supplementary Fig.
34
). With respect to the homogeneous reaction catalysed by Ir–porphyrin (Fig.
4b
; see Supplementary Fig.
35
for further details), a lower activation barrier for C(
sp
3
)O–H insertion (1.28 eV) compared with C(
sp
2
)O–H insertion (1.62 eV) was found, suggesting that
3am
is initially formed. However, an even lower activation barrier for the subsequent C(
sp
2
)O–H insertion of
3am
(1.01 eV) was calculated in this homogeneous system, consistent with the formation of an unselective mixture of mono insertion
3am
and bis insertion
3am″
(Supplementary Fig.
35
).

The microscopic origin of the aforementioned distinct activation barriers in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems was examined. Although both catalysts possess a planar four-coordinate structure, the chemical potential of the iridium carbene intermediate is expected to be influenced by the oxidation states of the catalytically active metal centre (Supplementary Fig.
15
). Analysis of the projected density of states of Ir-SA and Ir(ttp)COCl showed that the increased cationic charge character of the Ir in Ir(ttp)COCl results in stronger bonding and adsorption energies of the carbene fragment, C
6
H
5
CCOOCH
3
, to Ir(ttp)COCl (−1.35 eV) compared with Ir-SA (−0.37 eV) (Supplementary Fig.
37
). Correlation of the activation barriers with the adsorption energies of C
6
H
5
CCOOCH
3
as a descriptor established the activity and selectivity trend (Supplementary Fig.
38
). Thus, the rate-determining step is expected to be the metal carbene formation for Ir-SA rather than the first C(
sp
2
)O–H. Experimentally, an absence of dependence on alcohol concentration (Supplementary Figs.
24
–
27
) and a dependence of the reaction on diazo concentration (Supplementary Figs.
28
–
31
) strongly supports turnover-limited formation of the iridium carbene intermediate
59
. Combined with these observations, the activity and selectivity analysis suggests that the ideal binding energy (
E
ad
= −0.55 eV) requires an iridium oxidation state between that of Ir-SA and Ir(ttp)COCl. Therefore, the loss of selectivity that results from generation of bis insertion
3am″
probably arises due to the further strengthening of the binding energies (
E
ad
< −1.04 eV) found in the higher oxidation states of metal carbene in the homogeneous catalyst (Supplementary Fig.
38
).
Conclusions
We have elaborated a two-step pyrolysis protocol for the synthesis of an Ir-SA catalyst supported by a hollow carbon polyhedron co-doped with N, P and S. Having synthesized this catalyst, its use for carbene insertion of methyl phenyl diazoacetate with various alcohols, aniline and
N
-protected indole was examined. High compatibility with a range of functional groups was observed in these Ir-SA-catalysed reactions. Moreover, the heterogeneous Ir-SA catalyst displayed a notable improvement in turnover number (1,456) compared with its homogeneous counterpart (turnover number, 462). The Ir-SA heterogeneous catalyst provided excellent control of selectivities (up to 99%) favouring C(
sp
3
)O–H carbene insertion over reaction with phenolic O–H bonds. On the basis of DFT calculation and experimental studies, the origin of the improved selectivity observed with the Ir-SA catalyst is posited to be correlated to the absorption energy of the metal carbene intermediate which results in the modulation of the activation barrier for the insertion reactions. Finally, given the potential for structural diversity in SAS catalysts, this work highlights the opportunity to develop selective transformations through merging of material science with application in organic synthesis.

O (5.58 g) in 150 ml methanol was added to a solution of 2-methylimidazole (6.16 g) in 150 ml methanol. After stirring at room temperature for 24 h, the obtained ZIF-8 precipitates were collected by centrifugation and dried in vacuum at 80 °C. Subsequently, the obtained ZIF-8 (600 mg) powder was dispersed in 100 ml methanol to which was added a methanol solution of iridium(

) chloride (1 mg ml
−1
, 7.08 ml). To this iridium-containing solution was added a mixture of 4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol (800 mg) and phosphonitrilic chloride trimer (375 mg) in 250 ml methanol. After vigorous stirring for 15 min, 3 ml triethylamine was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 15 h, and the as-obtained ZIF-8/Ir@PZS precipitates were separated by centrifugation and dried in vacuum at 80 °C. The as-obtained ZIF-8/Ir@PZS was placed in a quartz boat and then maintained at 950 °C for 3 h in a tube furnace with a heating rate of 5 °C min
−1
under a flowing argon atmosphere. After allowing it to cool to room temperature, the as-prepared sample of Ir-SA was collected and used without further treatment.
XAFS data analysis details
The acquired EXAFS data were processed according to the standard procedure using the ATHENA module implemented in the IIRFFIT software packages. The EXAFS spectra were collected by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step. Then, the

-edge were Fourier transformed to real (R) space using a Hanning window (

−1
) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. To obtain the quantitative structural parameters around central atoms
60
, we performed least-squares curve parameter fitting by using the ARTEMIS module of the IIRFFIT software packages. The following EXAFS equation was used:
$$\begin{array}{l}\chi \left( k \right) = \mathop {\sum}\limits_j {\frac{{N_jS_0^2F_j\left( k \right)}}{{k\,R_j^2}}} \exp \left[ { - 2\,k^2\sigma _j^2} \right]\exp \left[ {\frac{{ - 2\,R_j}}{{\lambda \left( k \right)}}} \right]\\ \sin \left[ {2k\,R_j + \phi _j\left( k \right)} \right]\end{array}$$

General procedure for selective O–H carbenoid insertion
In a glovebox, diazo ester
1X
(0.10 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) and alcohol
2Y
(0.05 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) were added sequentially to a suspension of Ir-SA (0.50 mol%) in 1,2-dichloroethane (0.50 ml) in a two-dram vial. The reaction vial was sealed and stirred at 60 °C for 20 h. After cooling to room temperature, the volatiles were removed by rotary evaporation and the obtained crude mixture was purified by silica gel flash chromatography using petroleum ether and EtOAc as eluents. The molar ratio of products was determined by
1
H-NMR spectroscopy.
Computational methods
DFT calculations were conducted using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package with the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
62
performing the generalized gradient approximation. A 8 × 8 single-layer graphene with 15 Å vacuum space was built to describe the model of Ir-SA, where the Ir atom was stabilized by four N atoms and the surface was also doped with S and P atoms (Supplementary Fig.
32a
). A Monkhorst–Pack
k
-point 2 × 2 × 1 was used in all the calculations for Ir-SA. The reaction over Ir(ttp)COCl catalyst was calculated in a large supercell with a lattice of 20 × 20 × 20 Å
3
to avoid interactions in the periodic calculations, where a Monkhorst–Pack
k
-point 1 × 1 × 1 was used (Supplementary Fig.
32b
). Ir–porphyrin (Supplementary Fig.
33a
) was employed in DFT studies of the catalytic reaction using Ir(ttp)COCl (Supplementary Fig.
33b
) due to the large computational costs. The calculated adsorption energy of carbene (C
6
H
5
CCOOCH
3
) to these two structures displayed only a small difference (0.07 eV), which supports the reliability of the model constructed using Ir–porphyrin (Supplementary Table
5
). A 400 eV cut-off energy was set for the plane-wave basis set. Structure optimizations were performed with the convergence force of 0.05 eV Å
−1
, and all the transition states were obtained using the climbing image nudged elastic band method
63
with the convergence force smaller than 0.1 eV Å
−
1
.
Free energy corrections
Free energy corrections were conducted in this work to simulate the reaction conditions at 333 K (ref.
64
). Standard free energy corrections were performed by the equation:
$${\Delta}{{G = }}{\Delta}{{E}}_{{\mathrm{DFT}}} + {\Delta}{{E}}_{{\mathrm{ZPE}}} + {\Delta}{{E}}_{\mathrm{U}} - {{T}}{\Delta}{{S}}$$
(2)
where Δ
E
DFT
refers to the electronic energy from DFT calculations. Δ
E
ZPE
, Δ
E
U
and Δ
S
are the corrections for zero-point energy, inner energy and entropy, respectively. Only vibrational motion was considered for adsorbates on the surface of catalysts, while translational, rotational and vibrational motions were all considered for gas molecules. The detail of the correction, including adsorbates, transition states and gas molecules, is displayed in Supplementary Table
