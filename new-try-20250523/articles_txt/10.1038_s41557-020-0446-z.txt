Abstract
Single-site catalysts can demonstrate high activity and selectivity in many catalytic reactions. The synthesis of these materials by impregnation from strongly oxidizing aqueous solutions or pH-controlled deposition often leads to low metal loadings or a range of metal species. Here, we demonstrate that simple impregnation of the metal precursors onto activated carbon from a low-boiling-point, low-polarity solvent, such as acetone, results in catalysts with an atomic dispersion of cationic metal species. We show the generality of this method by producing single-site Au, Pd, Ru and Pt catalysts supported on carbon in a facile manner. Single-site Au/C catalysts have previously been validated commercially to produce vinyl chloride, and here we show that this facile synthesis method can produce effective catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination in the absence of the highly oxidizing acidic solvents previously used.

The development of heterogeneous catalysts containing stabilized single cationic metal species has resulted in materials that have high metal utilization, increased selectivity and high efficiency

, single-site catalysts (SSCs) show promising reactivity. The facile synthesis of these materials is crucial to fully exploit their potential on a larger scale. While many heterogeneous catalysts contain a varied population of metal nanostructures, including nanoparticles, clusters and atomic species
8
, the facile targeted synthesis of isolated metal atoms remains a challenge as methods are not currently readily scalable for commercial application

Many studies have implicated cationic Au as the active species for acetylene hydrochlorination, and hence materials containing these species are important examples of SSCs
12
. Currently, 13 Mt yr
–1
of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM, that is, chloroethene) are produced by acetylene hydrochlorination using HgCl
2
on activated carbon, which poses significant environmental concerns as up to 0.6 kg Hg is lost per tonne of VCM produced
13
. The recently ratified Minamata convention (
http://www.mercuryconvention.org/
) dictates that all new VCM plants must use mercury-free catalysts and in the near future all existing industrial plants must switch to mercury-free alternatives. Recently, Au/C has been validated commercially as a replacement for the existing catalyst systems
13
,
14
, the active species in this catalyst being atomically dispersed cationic gold chloride
12
. Au SSCs have been prepared using aqua regia (HNO
3
/HCl, 1:3) as solvent, but they lack stability under the reaction conditions
15
, however, use of an aqueous Au thiosulfate complex leads to a stable Au SCC that shows potential in this acetylene hydrochlorination process
13
.
In this report, we show that it is possible to prepare highly dispersed metal catalyst materials containing Ru, Pd, Pt and Au using a simple methodology in the absence of highly oxidizing acidic solvents, by impregnation from a low-boiling-point, low-polarity solvent such as acetone. We show that gold catalysts prepared in this way exhibit comparable activity in acetylene hydrochlorination to catalysts prepared with acidic and oxidizing solvents, and that previous correlations of catalyst activity with the standard electrode potentials of the cations can be reproduced with this new preparation method.
Results and discussion
The preparation of SSCs is often carried out in aqueous solutions by deposition or impregnation methods

. This limits the choice of precursor to water-soluble metal salts, preventing the use of organometallic metal salts containing organic ligands. In addition, the use of solvents with lower boiling points than water to reduce the catalyst drying temperature could reduce the likelihood of sintering of the highly dispersed species. To explore this we initially prepared 1 wt.% Pd/C, Pt/C, Ru/C and Au/C materials through a facile wet impregnation method using Pd, Pt and Ru acetylacetonates, which have limited solubility in aqueous solutions, and chloroauric acid as precursors in acetone as solvent. The catalysts prepared using different solvents are denoted as metal/C-solvent.
Characterization of the materials by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; Fig.
1a
) showed the absence of diffraction patterns consistent with metallic or metal oxide crystallites, suggesting high metal dispersion. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig.
1b–d
) of the Pt (4
f
7/2
), Pd (3
d
5/2
) and Ru (3
d
5/2
) regions of the respective fresh materials suggested that Pt and Pd are present in the 2+ oxidation state (with binding energies of 73.0 and 337.9 eV, respectively), whereas Ru is in the 3+ oxidation state (with a binding energy of 281.9 eV). This confirms the retention of the expected oxidation state of the metal and suggests deposition of the intact acetylacetonate complexes

20
. The results of the PXRD and XPS analyses of the carbon supports are presented in Supplementary Figs.

and

, which show that the carbon surface contains less than 5 atom% oxygen, mostly as C–O–C, C–OH and C=O functional groups. To probe the Au speciation in the fresh Au/C catalyst we conducted Au L
3
-edge (11.92 keV) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As has been previously reported, cationic Au species can undergo significant photoreduction during XPS analysis, leading to the over-representation of Au(
0
) content in this class of catalyst
21
. Due to its lower X-ray absorption cross-sections at high incident photon energy, XAS can be considered a less destructive technique for highly dispersed Au chloride catalysts. Thus, analysis of the normalized white line intensity corresponding to Au 2

The Fourier-transform extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (FT-EXAFS) spectrum (Fig.
1e
) of the Au/C material prepared by acetone impregnation reveals an intensity consistent with that of isolated Au chloride species with no evidence of metallic Au–Au interactions, supporting a high dispersion of cationic species. This was confirmed by EXAFS analysis and linear combination fitting (LCF) of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) region (Supplementary Fig.
3a
). The results suggest that the metal is present in cationic form as a mixture of Au chloride species: 23% Au(
iii
) and 77% Au(
i
). EXAFS fitting of the fresh Au/C catalyst using models comprising Au–O, Au–Cl or mixtures of Au–Cl and Au–O were compared, with no satisfying fit for anything other than Au–Cl with a coordination number of 2.3(1) (Supplementary Fig.
3b
). Therefore, there is no compelling evidence for Au–O speciation or the anchoring of Au through surface oxygen species. Similar analyses of the Pt L
3
-edge, Pd K-edge and Ru K-edge were carried out. The analysis of the XANES region of the 1 wt.% [Pd(acac)
2
]/C material (acac, acetylacetonate; Supplementary Fig.
4a
) confirmed the presence of [Pd(acac)
2
] species with no intensity consistent with Pd–Pd interactions in the FT-EXAFS spectrum (Supplementary Fig.
4b
). Similar results were obtained for the 1 wt.% [Pt(acac)
2
]/C and [Ru(acac)
3
]/C materials (Supplementary Figs.
5a,b
and
6a,b
), on which the acetylacetonate complexes were also deposited intact. Fitting of the Pt, Pd and Ru EXAFS data further proved intact metal complex deposition, with metal–O and metal–C coordination numbers and path lengths being comparable to those of metal acetylacetonate standards (Supplementary Table
1
). Characterization of the 1 wt.% Au/C-acetone catalyst by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) revealed the Au speciation to be predominantly atomically dispersed with some occasional dimeric Au species and subnanometre clusters, but with no evidence at all of larger Au crystallites. A representative image is shown in Fig.
1f
, which closely resembles the 1 wt.% Au/C-aqua regia catalyst extensively studied previously for the acetylene hydrochlorination reaction
12
. Similar high metal dispersions can be observed in the corresponding HAADF-STEM images of the Pd/C, Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts (Supplementary Fig.
7a–f
).
We then systematically studied the synthesis of the Au/C catalyst by this facile method for the acetylene hydrochlorination reaction. The preparation of Au/C catalysts by wet impregnation of H[AuCl
4
] from aqueous solution resulted in Au nanoparticles after the sample had been dried at 140 °C for 16 h under a flow of N
2
; these nanoparticles showed little activity for acetylene hydrochlorination
15
. The reduction of H[AuCl
4
] is facilitated partly by the reducing nature of the carbon support material, which can contain oxidizable surface groups, and by the reduced stability of H[AuCl
4
] in aqueous solutions, according to the Au–Cl–H
2
O Pourbaix diagram
24
. As H[AuCl
4
] is highly soluble in many organic solvents, in addition to acetone, we prepared catalysts using a wide range of solvents. The solvents used in this study, together with their boiling points and polarity
25
, are listed in Supplementary Table
2
. Typically, the catalysts were dried for 16 h at temperatures 5 to 10 °C higher than the boiling point under a flow of N
2
. Wherever possible, extra dry solvents were used in the preparations (denoted as (dry)).
The steady-state acetylene hydrochlorination activities (gas hourly space velocity, GHSV = 17,600 h
−1
) are reported in Fig.
2a
for Au/C catalysts prepared with a series of C

–C

alcohols. As the alcohol chain length increased, and consequently as the polarity of the solvent decreased, the activity of the catalysts increased, from 3% conversion for catalysts prepared in water to 20% conversion for samples prepared in the C
4
alcohol 2-butanol. Ketones such as acetone and 2-butanone, in addition to ethers such as THF, ethyl acetate and diethyl ether, were tested to investigate the effect of decreasing the polarity further, resulting in a slight increase in conversion to 23%. The well-studied Au/C catalyst prepared in aqua regia gave a steady-state conversion of 18%, meaning that the catalysts prepared by simple wet impregnation of H[AuCl
4
] from low-polarity, easy-to-handle solvents such as acetone, 2
-
butanol and THF performed better than the catalyst prepared in highly acidic oxidizing conditions. All the catalysts tested displayed a high selectivity towards VCM (>99%).

The plateau of activity observed at 20–24% when decreasing the polarity of the impregnation solvents represents the practical limit of dispersion that can be achieved
12
. The PXRD patterns for samples prepared in solvents with varying polarity are displayed in Fig.
2b
. Wet impregnation from aqueous solutions results in reflections at 2
θ
angles of 38, 44, 64 and 77°, which correspond to the face-centred cubic structure of metallic Au with an average crystallite size of ~20 nm, as determined by the Scherrer equation. These features are also present in the catalyst samples prepared with high-polarity solvents, with the reflections indicating average nanoparticle sizes of 18 to 24 nm. The intensities of these reflections systematically decrease as the polarity of the solvent decreases. The samples with the highest activities show very weak or undetectable diffraction patterns corresponding to metallic Au, indicating high dispersion and supporting the hypothesis that Au nanoparticles are not the active species in this reaction.
As the solvents used were not strongly acidic or oxidizing, the reason for the high activity could arise from (1) the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the solvents, providing increased wetting of the carbon support material leading to higher dispersion, (2) lower drying temperatures preventing Au agglomeration, (3) the complete absence of water in the catalyst preparation or (4) the stabilization of the Au in high oxidation states in the absence of water. Therefore we next investigated the use of low-polarity solvents with high boiling points such as
N
,
N
-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and cyclohexanone. The polarities, boiling points and drying temperatures along with the acetylene conversion values are reported in Table
1
. Although all the catalysts prepared with high-boiling-point (>120 °C) solvents performed better than the catalyst prepared in aqueous solution, they were not as active as the samples prepared with low-boiling-point solvents (<120 °C), suggesting that the drying temperature is also a parameter affecting the performance of the catalysts as well as the reducibility of the solvent at that specific drying temperature. PXRD analysis (Supplementary Fig.
8
) showed that the catalysts prepared at high drying temperatures contained Au nanoparticles, which is consistent with their lower activity. To probe whether the drying temperature was the only variable determining the high activity and dispersion, catalyst samples prepared with acetone were dried at 45, 65 and 140 °C for 16 h. As reported in Table
1
, the catalysts dried at 65 and 140 °C showed comparable activity to the sample dried at 45 °C, which demonstrates that effective catalysts can be prepared with low-polarity solvents and low drying temperatures. This suggests that it is the increased wettability of the impregnation solution on the carbon support coupled with mild drying conditions that leads to effective anchoring of single highly dispersed Au species, rather than the speciation being solely dictated by the drying temperature. Adding increasing amounts of water (5–50 vol.%) to the extra dry acetone decreased the activity of the as-prepared catalyst, as shown in Fig.
2c
, until at 50 vol.% the activity resembled that of samples prepared in aqueous solution. This reduction in activity correlates well with the development of reflections from metallic Au in the recorded PXRD patterns (Fig.
2d
). This confirms the negative impact of the presence of water on the preparation of highly dispersed Au catalysts in the absence of strong oxidizing/acidic agents or strongly coordinating ligands.

2
O catalysts (Supplementary Fig.
9
) showed the high stability of the Au/C-acetone catalyst under the reaction conditions. There was a small (3%) increase in conversion in the first 100 min, indicating a possible minor change in the Au oxidation state and a minimal induction period, followed by a further 140 min of steady conversion. The Au/C-aqua regia catalyst displayed a pronounced induction period due to changes in the Au oxidation state, which have been previously studied by in situ XAS, resulting in a 15% difference in conversion over the same time. The oxidizing aqua regia solvent, which has been used historically, resulted in a catalyst with a lower final conversion than that of the more benign catalyst prepared with acetone. This strongly suggests that the likely different functionality of the carbon supports can play a key role in determining the induction periods of these catalysts, through either stronger Au anchoring or facilitating changes in the oxidation state. As noted in previous work
12
, the Au present on Au/C-H
2
O is largely unreactive, being predominantly Au(0), hence this catalyst maintained a low (2%) conversion throughout the test.
We have previously demonstrated that 0.1 wt.% Au-S
2
O
3
/C catalysts, prepared from gold(
i
) thiosulfate on carbon extrudates, show high activity and productivity for acetylene hydrochlorination
13
. Catalysts were therefore also prepared at a 0.1 wt.% Au loading using H[AuCl
4
] in acetone to compare the performances of these materials at low gold loading. Under testing using undiluted gas feeds (HCl/C

/C material gave 23% conversion at 130 °C and a maximum 56% conversion at 180 °C. A 0.1 wt.% Au/C catalyst prepared from H[AuCl
4
] in acetone gave similar activities (27% conversion at 130 °C and 52% conversion at 180 °C) after 24 h of reaction. This is consistent with both materials containing highly dispersed gold cations. At 1 wt.% loading, the Au/C catalyst prepared from Au(
i
) thiosulfate also gave a comparable performance in acetylene hydrochlorination to the material prepared from H[AuCl
4
] in acetone.
XAS spectra at the Au L
3
-edge of the Au/C-acetone catalyst before and after reaction for 4 h were recorded, analysed and compared with those of the Au/C-aqua regia catalyst and Au foil. The three Au/C catalysts reveal significantly different post-edge features in comparison with metallic Au foil (Fig.
3a
). This supports the findings of PXRD and STEM analyses that no extended metallic Au structures are present in the fresh catalysts prepared with acetone or aqua regia. In particular, the normalized white line heights of the fresh samples prepared with acetone and aqua regia suggest that both catalysts contain a mixture of Au(
i
) and Au(
iii
) species, with the acetone catalyst being slightly more rich in Au(
i
) than the comparable sample prepared using aqua regia, based on a lower normalized white line height intensity (~0.66 for Au/C-acetone and ~0.78 for Au/C-aqua regia, Fig.
3a
). Three different Au standards were used to perform a LCF analysis of the Au L
3
-edge XANES spectra: Au(

) (K[AuCl
4
]/[AuCl
4
]
–
), Au(
i
) ([AuCl

]
–
) and a Au foil standard spectra (Fig.
3b
). The LCF confirmed the cationic nature of the Au in the acetone-derived catalyst, with the Au predominantly existing in the Au(
i
) oxidation state (77%). This is similar in nature to the catalyst prepared using aqua regia, albeit with a different distribution of Au(
i
) and Au(
iii
) (57 and 43%, respectively). After 5 h of use, a small contribution from Au(0) could be detected in the Au/C-acetone catalyst, indicating a minor instability of the cationic Au species. It has been postulated that the reduction of Au species is responsible for catalyst deactivation; the stability observed in the acetylene hydrochlorination tests suggests that this agglomeration takes place during the heating ramp to the reaction temperatures and not during the reaction itself
26
. The EXAFS data for the fresh Au/C-acetone and Au/C-aqua regia catalysts (Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Table
3
) show Au–Cl distances and coordination numbers of 2.31(8) Å and 2.58(8), respectively, consistent with the mixed Au(
iii
)/Au(
i
) speciation determined by XANES. No long-range order or characteristic Au–Au distances were observed in the EXAFS spectra of either catalyst, when compared with the Au foil standard, again in agreement with the PXRD and HAADF-STEM analyses. An increase in the intensity of the Fourier transform at distances corresponding to those of the Au foil was observed in the used catalyst, in conjunction with a decrease in the Au–Cl bond length to 2.0(1) Å and the appearance of a Au–Au coordination number of 1.6, consistent with the formation of small amounts of Au(0). These Au(0) species have previously been demonstrated to be large (>1 nm) and inactive in acetylene hydrochlorination
26
. LCF analysis of the XANES spectrum of the used catalyst (Fig.
3b
) confirmed the presence of 14% Au(0).

To determine the stability of the Au/C-acetone catalyst, a prolonged reaction was performed. After 4 h of reaction, the catalyst was cooled to room temperature under a flow of argon, left sealed for 16 h, heated under a flow of Ar and then subjected to the reaction conditions for a further 3 h. The same test was performed with the Au/C-aqua regia material for comparison. This test, illustrated in Fig.
4
, shows the stability of the Au/C-acetone catalyst, maintaining a conversion of 19–20% for over 5 h, indicating that after the first 100 min of reaction the Au oxidation states and dispersion remained relatively stable. Supplementary Fig.
10
shows the PXRD pattern of the Au/C-acetone catalyst after 7 h of reaction, along with those of the fresh material and the catalyst used for 4 h for comparison. The characteristic reflections of Au nanoparticles had increased slightly in size after 7 h of reaction, suggesting the slow sintering of the catalyst at extended reaction times. Furthermore, due to the lack of catalyst deactivation, it is likely that this Au(0) forms during heating or the initial stages of the reaction before stabilization
27
. To confirm this point, in situ PXRD analysis of the Au/C-acetone catalyst (Supplementary Fig.
11a
) was performed while heating the sample under an inert atmosphere to 250 °C; Au reflections could be observed upon reaching a temperature of 190 °C. A similar analysis was performed on the other supported metal catalysts (Pt/C, Pd/C and Ru/C, Supplementary Fig.
11b–d
), which demonstrated their relative thermal stability under an inert atmosphere. To further probe the thermal stability of these catalysts, samples prepared with Pd and Ru acetylacetonate in acetone were compared with catalysts prepared from the respective chloride precursors in either acidic or aqueous impregnation solvents. After heating to 450 °C under a N
2
atmosphere, PXRD analysis (Supplementary Fig.
12
) showed that the Pd sample remained highly dispersed in the case of the acetylacetonate/acetone preparation, but underwent agglomeration from a highly dispersed catalyst in the case of the chloride-containing precursor. In both cases Ru was able to be dispersed with high thermal stability in the materials prepared from both Ru(acac)

4
and the correlation between the coordination numbers determined by XANES and EXAFS are shown in Supplementary Figs.
13
and
14
) at various stages of the reaction (Fig.
5a
) showed that the catalyst remained stable upon heating to 180 °C under Ar. Upon exposure to HCl at this temperature, an increase in Au(
iii
) chloride was observed, which was stable upon initial exposure to the acetylene reagent. After 240 min, the proportions of Au(
i
) and Au(
iii
) chloride were significantly changed with a minor contribution from Au(0) being observed. Analysis of the analogous Pd, Pt and Ru catalysts by ex situ EXAFS spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
13
and Tables
5
–
7
) revealed that the metal acetylacetonates were stable to heating to 180 °C under argon with no indication of metal agglomeration. Upon introduction of the reactants, the acetylacetonates were converted into dispersed metal chlorides, which remained in that state for the 240-min reaction time. HAADF-STEM (Supplementary Fig.
15
) imaging showed that the isolated cation sites remain intact, apart from a few subnanometre clusters visible in the Pd/C and Ru/C samples, and XPS showed that these species remain as oxidized metal centres (Supplementary Fig.
16
). As shown in Fig.

, a linear correlation is observed between the steady-state productivity and the standard electrode potential, demonstrating the generality of this new preparation method in being able to produce analogous catalytic trends to the previously reported family of catalysts prepared in highly acidic and oxidizing solvents.

Hence we have shown it is possible to prepare effective Au/C acetylene hydrochlorination catalysts consisting of atomically dispersed cationic Au species by a simple wet impregnation method using low-polarity solvents with low boiling points. This method allows the facile preparation of Au SSCs in addition to highly dispersed Ru/C, Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts with relatively high metal loadings, which allows the potential of these materials to be fully exploited by removing the need to deal with highly acidic waste during catalyst preparation, opening the possibility to produce these catalysts without the need for water-soluble metal salts.
Methods
Catalyst preparation
All carbon-supported gold catalysts were prepared by a previously reported wet impregnation method
12
. Activated carbon was initially ground to obtain a powder (150–200 mesh). The gold precursor, H[AuCl
4
]
·
3H
2
O (Alfa Aesar, 20 mg, assay 49%), was dissolved in the required solvent (2.7 ml). The gold precursor solution was then added dropwise, with stirring, to the activated carbon (0.99 g) to obtain a catalyst with a final metal loading of 1 wt.%. The resulting powder was dried at a temperature 5–10 °C higher than the boiling point of the solvent used for 16 h under a flow of N
2
. Wherever possible, extra dry solvents sealed under nitrogen were used. The Ru/C, Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts were prepared by the same wet impregnation procedure. In these cases, Ru(
iii
) acetylacetonate (Aldrich), Pd(
ii
) acetylacetonate (Aldrich) and Pt(
ii
) 2,4-pentanedionate (Alfa Aesar) were used as precursors.
Catalyst testing
The catalysts were tested for acetylene hydrochlorination in a fixed-bed polyimide (Kapton) microreactor (outer diameter 6 mm, length 20 cm) contained within a heating block powered by two heating cartridges inside the block. The temperature was controlled by a Eurotherm controller with a type K thermocouple positioned in the centre of the heating block. C

H

/Ar (5.01% balanced in Ar, BOC) and HCl/Ar (5.05% balanced in Ar, BOC) gases were dried, using moisture traps, prior to introduction into the reactor. In all cases, the reactor was purged with Ar (99.99% BIP, Air Products) prior to admitting the hydrochlorination reaction mixture. The reactor was heated to 200 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C min
−1
and held at this temperature for 30 min, all under a flow of Ar (50 ml min
−1
). The reaction gas mixture of C

H
2
/Ar (23.56 ml min
−1
), HCl/Ar (23.76 ml min
−1
) and additional Ar (2.70 ml min
−1
) was introduced into the heated reactor chamber containing the catalyst (90 mg) at a total GHSV of ~17,600 h
−1
, keeping the C

H
2
/HCl ratio at a constant value of 1:1.02. Typical time-on-stream experiments were conducted for 240 min. The gas-phase products were analysed on-line using a Varian 450 GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Chromatographic separation and identification of the products were carried out using a Porapak N packed column (6 ft × 1/8″ stainless steel). A conversion of 100% C

gave a VCM productivity of 35.33 mol kg

under the reaction conditions used. The experimental error in acetylene conversion was ±1% for repeated tests.
Catalyst characterization
PXRD patterns were acquired using an X’Pert Pro PAN Analytical powder diffractometer employing a Cu Kα radiation source operating at 40 keV and 40 mA. The spectra were analysed using the X’Pert High Score Plus software. The mean crystallite sizes of metallic gold nanoparticles, where possible, were determined using the Scherrer equation assuming a spherical particle shape and a
K
factor of 0.89 at the reflection arising from the set of (111) Au planes at 2
θ
= 38°. The diffractograms of the catalysts were compared with the following reference files from the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards: Pd (00-001-1201), PdO (03-065-5065), Pt (01-080-3828), PtO (01-085-0714) and Au (01-071-4614).
XAS spectra of all the Au/C samples were recorded at the Au L
3
absorption edge, in transmission mode, at the B18 beamline of Diamond Light Source, Harwell, UK. The measurements were performed using a quick-EXAFS set-up with a fast-scanning Si(111) double crystal monochromator. The DEMETER software package (ATHENA and ARTEMIS) was used for XAFS data analysis of the Au/C absorption spectra in comparison with standards and relative to Au foil
28
.
Materials for examination by STEM were dry-dispersed onto a holey carbon TEM copper grids. Selected catalyst samples were examined using bright-field STEM and HAADF-STEM imaging modes in an aberration-corrected JEOL ARM-200CF microscope operating at 200 kV. This microscope was also equipped with a Centurio silicon drift detector system.
XPS was carried out using a Thermo Scientific K-alpha photoelectron spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The resulting spectra were processed in CasaXPS and calibrated against the C 1
s
line at 284.7 eV.
