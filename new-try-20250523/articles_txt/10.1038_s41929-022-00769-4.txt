Abstract
The size of supported metal species is known to have a profound influence on their catalytic activity. However, this structure sensitivity remains ambiguous for metals at the atomic scale due to the lack of single-atom sensitive and statistically significant quantification methods. Here we overcome this difficulty to quantify the catalytic contribution of various surface palladium species, ranging from single atoms to sub-nanometre clusters and nanoparticles, in the dehydrogenation of dodecahydro-
N
-ethylcarbazole, a reaction of importance for H
2
transportation and utilization. We show that the optimal site is a fully exposed palladium cluster with an average Pd–Pd coordination number of
∼
4.4, favouring both the activation of reactants and desorption of products, whereas palladium single atoms are almost inactive. Our study highlights that for certain catalytic reactions, the construction of fully exposed metal clusters without the presence of spectators (that is, palladium single atoms in this work) could help to maximize the reactivity and the atomic efficiency of noble metals.

The facile catalytic dehydrogenation of liquid organic hydrogen carriers at mild temperatures to discharge high-purity H
2
holds great value for onboard proton-exchange membrane fuel cell applications
1
,
2
. One particularly promising liquid organic hydrogen carrier system, which has been commercially demonstrated in passenger vehicles in China (
https://www.hynertech.com/nd.jsp?id=62
), is the reversible
N
-ethylcarbazole/dodecahydro-
N
-ethylcarbazole (NEC/DNEC) hydrogen storage system, which has a dehydrogenation temperature of
∼
443 K and possesses other advantages (Fig.

)
3
,
4
. Supported palladium catalysts have been shown to possess excellent intrinsic reactivity in the dehydrogenation of DNEC as compared to other group VIII metals
5
,
6
,
7
. Representative works by Smith and co-workers have shown that the turnover frequencies (TOFs) of supported palladium nanoparticles (NPs) in the 2–20 nm range are sensitive to the palladium particle size, and this structure sensitivity was attributed to the huge difference in the activation of DNEC by palladium atoms in different surface facets
8
. However, these studies were limited by the structural analysis tools available and were not able to investigate the structural sensitivity of metal species in the sub-nanometre regime. To date, the sluggish dehydrogenation process and the high loading of noble metal in the catalysts remain the main obstacles to the large-scale commercial application of the NEC/DNEC system, calling for better understanding of the optimal catalytic active structure and for further development of highly efficient low-cost catalysts.

In pursuit of the ultimate atomic efficiency of noble metals, substantial efforts have been focused on the synthesis and application of catalysts with exclusively isolated single-atom sites (also known as single-atom catalysts, SACs)
9
,
10
,
11
,
12
. Although SACs could in principle achieve 100% dispersion and potentially controllable coordination structures, they are clearly not effective for all catalytic reactions. In many cases, metal clusters, NPs or even large domains of surface facets with continuous metal sites—in a metallic state in place of the cationic state of most isolated metal single atoms—are prerequisites for the dissociation and/or the formation of the target chemical bonds
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
17
. Theoretical studies have shown that the adsorption of DNEC on palladium requires multiple metal sites
8
,
18
, suggesting that a catalytic site with an ensemble of metal atoms is required for the dehydrogenation reaction of DNEC. In addition, as the dehydrogenation of DNEC is a typical multistep reaction (Fig.
1
), there may be different site requirements of metal species for the different stages of the reaction. Therefore, to reach a balance between higher atomic utilization of noble metals and site requirements for favourable adsorption and reaction, selecting the optimal palladium structures, from the single-atom level to the nanometre scale, for the different stages of dehydrogenation of DNEC is of great importance.
In this article the structure sensitivity of supported palladium species, ranging from isolated single-atom sites to few-atom clusters, atomic-layered clusters and 2–10 nm NPs, is systematically investigated for the dehydrogenation of DNEC and tetrahydro-
N
-ethylcarbazole (TNEC). By combining single-atom sensitive electron microscopy, single-site sensitive optical spectroscopy and bulk sensitive X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we can quantitatively determine the statistical site distributions of different palladium species within a series of palladium catalysts. We further establish the correlation between the average Pd–Pd coordination numbers (
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
) of palladium species and the site-specific TOFs. We show that the palladium single-atom sites are not effective for the dehydrogenation reaction of DNEC. Instead, the most active palladium species for consecutive dehydrogenation reactions are the fully exposed atomic-layered palladium clusters with
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\approx4.4\)
, representing the most effective combination of atom utilization efficiency and favourable ensemble requirement for the adsorption/transformation of the reactants.
Results
Synthesis and characterization of catalysts
The synthesis of a series of palladium catalysts supported on nanodiamond (ND) was realized by controlling the palladium loading and the synthesis methods (see
Methods
for more details). Notably, NDs are essentially crystalline
sp
3
-C NPs with an
sp
2
-C-terminated surface (Supplementary Fig.
2
). According to previous reports, the
sp
2
-C layer contains abundant surface defects and functional groups (for example, hydroxyl groups)
11
,
19
,
20
. During the synthesis, these unique surface units serve as the nucleation sites for metal
21
,
22
, making palladium atomically dispersed on the support at relative lower loadings, and also help to improve the stability of the catalyst structure during reaction. Based on the structural characteristics of palladium species (as will be shown later), the catalysts are named Pd

/ND (
x

y
= 1, 2, 3), in which Pd

, Pd

and Pd
p
are notations for isolated single atoms, clusters and NPs, respectively.
The dispersion of the catalysts was measured by the H
2
–O
2
titration method
23
. As shown in Table
1
, Pd
1
/ND, Pd
n1
/ND and Pd
n2
/ND all show high dispersion values close to unity, which suggests that Pd
n1
/ND and Pd
n2
/ND catalysts consist of fully exposed palladium clusters and single atoms. As for the three Pd
p
y
/ND catalysts, the dispersion decreases rapidly from 61.5% to 27.6%, indicating the emergence of bulk palladium particles in these catalysts. This trend was also observed from the ever-increasing intensity of the Pd(111) diffraction peak in the X-ray diffraction data (Supplementary Fig.
3
).

The atomic-scale structure of the catalysts was analysed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). From the high-resolution
Z
-contrast images, the Pd
1
/ND with the minimum palladium loading (0.07 wt%) shows predominantly isolated single palladium atoms on the ND support (Fig.
2a
and Supplementary Fig.
4
). For Pd
n
x
/ND, with the increase of palladium loading from 0.25 wt% to 0.4 wt%, additional palladium clusters emerge, and the geometry of palladium clusters evolves from ensembles with only a few atoms in Pd
n1
/ND (Fig.
2b
and Supplementary Fig.
5
) to 1–2 nm atomic-layered clusters in Pd
n2
/ND (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Fig.
6
). By tuning the synthesis methods, the three Pd
p
y
/ND catalysts all incorporate palladium NPs with clear crystalline structures, and the average size of the palladium NPs gradually increases from around 2 nm (Pd
p1
/ND) to 3 nm (Pd
p2
/ND) and 4–10 nm (Pd
p3
/ND) (Fig.
2d–f
and Supplementary Figs.
7
–
9
). From the large-scale STEM images, both palladium clusters and NPs in Pd
n
x
/ND and Pd
p
y
/ND are distributed relatively homogeneously (Supplementary Figs.
10
and
11
). The STEM images also highlight the broadly coexisting Pd
1
species (some of these are highlighted by yellow circles in Fig.
2b–e
). Because it is difficult to avoid creating these atomically dispersed Pd
1
atoms during synthesis, this phenomenon is even more ubiquitous for cluster catalysts with higher dispersion (Fig.
2b,c
), that is, we always get a mixture of Pd
1
atoms and Pd
n
clusters even in catalysts designed to be ‘cluster’ catalysts. Therefore, it is important to measure the population of Pd
1
in each catalyst to quantify the intrinsic activities of the multi-atom (ensemble) palladium sites.

within different catalysts. As shown in Fig.

1
/ND manifests two CO-adsorption (CO

−1
, respectively, assigned to two types of CO adsorption on Pd
1
sites (see Supplementary Fig.
12
, Supplementary Table
1
and Supplementary Note 1 for more information)
24
,
25
,
26
. As CO tends to adsorb over the bridge or hollow sites of palladium ensembles, the absence of peaks in the 1,800–2,000 cm
−1
range suggests that there are no multi-atom ensembles in this Pd
1
/ND catalyst. In contrast, CO
ads
on Pd
n
x
/ND shows not only evident Pd
1
signatures, but also distinct peaks at 2,060 cm
−1
and around 1,968–1,860 cm
−1
, while all Pd
p
y
/ND samples are featured with intense broad peaks at 1,905 cm
−1
and weak peaks at 2,040 cm
−1
. Combining the structural information from electron microscopy analysis and previous studies
27
, the singular 2,060 and 2,040 cm
−1
peaks can be assigned to the linearly bonded CO on the rims of palladium clusters and the edges of palladium particles, respectively; the broad bands at lower-frequency regions (<2,000 cm
−1
) are related to the bridge-bonded or triple-bonded CO on continuous palladium ensembles from Pd
n
x
and Pd
p
y
28
. On the Pd
n
cluster catalysts, we can always observe the linearly bonded CO on Pd
1
sites (2,120 and 2,080 cm
−1
), suggesting that these catalysts contain a mixture of Pd
1
and Pd
n
species, consistent with the STEM observations. By weighting the integrated area of different peaks by the corresponding extinction coefficients, we could estimate the Pd
1
fraction (
F
Pd1
) in different catalysts (see
Methods
for more information)
29
,
30
,
31
,
32
. As expected, in addition to the Pd
1
/ND catalyst with 100% Pd
1
species, catalysts with relatively high dispersion also show significant contributions from Pd
1
species, for example, the
F
Pd1
of Pd
n1
/ND and Pd
n2
/ND is 44.1% and 34.7%, respectively. However, for nanoparticle catalysts, as the average palladium NP size increase, the fraction of Pd
1
in these catalysts decreases greatly (12.5% in Pd
p1
/ND) and eventually becomes negligible (around 0% in Pd
p3
/ND) (Table
1
).
The Pd–Pd coordination numbers of different catalysts were determined by Fourier-transformed
k
2
-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (Fig.
3a
). From Pd
1
/ND to Pd
p3
/ND, the ever-increasing scattering of Pd–Pd versus Pd–C/O reflected the overall structural evolution of palladium from predominantly isolated single atoms to few-atom ensembles and finally to NPs with bulk properties. Through quantitative EXAFS curve fitting (Supplementary Fig.
13
and Supplementary Table
5
) and using the estimated
F
Pd1
value from CO-probe DRIFT experiments, the
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
of palladium ensembles (clusters and particles) were determined, with the contribution of Pd
1
sites subtracted (see
Methods
for more details). As we will show later, palladium single atoms are almost inactive in the DNEC dehydrogenation reaction. The aim of quantifying the
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
of the palladium ensembles is to obtain a statistical representation of the catalytically active site structure with atomic precision, which is vital to elucidate the structure–property relationship of DNEC dehydrogenation catalysts. Typically, with increasing size of palladium ensembles, the
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
increases monotonically from 1.9 (Pd
n1
) to 4.4 (Pd
n2
) to >6.9 (Pd
p
y
) (Table
1
). Considering the strong correlation between the dimension of the metal ensembles and their average coordination numbers, the
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
, which describes the statistically averaged local coordination properties of the active sites, thus could be used as a more suitable structural descriptor for palladium species than the average particle size obtained from limited electron microscopy sampling (see Supplementary Note
2
for more discussion).

The average Pd–Pd coordination number is expected to have a significant influence on the electronic structure of the palladium ensembles. From the Pd 3
d
XPS spectra (Fig.
3b
), Pd
p2
/ND and Pd
p3
/ND clearly share a similar peak position at around 335.6 eV, ascribed to the metallic state of Pd
0
(ref.
33
). With the increase of palladium dispersion, the Pd 3
d
peak gradually shifts to higher binding energies; notably, a 1.1 eV positive shift from palladium metallic state is observed for Pd
1
/ND. Since the final state effect (screening) is less notable on conductive supports, such binding energy shift to higher binding energies generally suggests more cationic charge states for the smaller palladium species. In line with the experimental results, similar size-dependent charge state variation has also been revealed by Bader charge state analysis and orbital analysis (Fig.
3c
, Supplementary Fig.
14
and Supplementary Note
3
), where graphene-immobilized Pd

, few-atom Pd

and crystalline Pd
p3
, respectively.
Structure sensitivity of Pd/ND catalysts
The reactivity of different Pd/ND catalysts was studied in the dehydrogenation of DNEC at 443 K and atmospheric pressure, with the conversions of the substrates controlled below 10%. Pristine ND without palladium loading cannot catalyse the DNEC dehydrogenation reaction (Supplementary Fig.
15
). Figure
4a
shows the palladium-normalized activity (that is, the consumption rate of DNEC normalized over the total palladium loading, showing the catalytic power of the catalyst based on all loaded palladium metal, an important economic measure of noble metal catalysts) and TOF (the activity normalized on surface palladium atoms) in DNEC dehydrogenation. According to previous studies, initial activation of the DNEC molecule on catalyst occurs within the five-membered ring side, producing octahydro-
N
-ethylcarbazole (ONEC) as the first stable intermediate
34
,
35
,
36
. Clearly, Pd
1
/ND, despite having the highest atomic utilization efficiency, shows a much lower TOF compared with catalysts with palladium ensemble sites, indicating that the presence of multiple adjacent palladium atoms is indispensable for catalysing a more favourable dehydrogenation path for DNEC molecules (that is, the ensemble requirement of DNEC dehydrogenation)
37
. Importantly, Pd
n2
/ND exhibits the highest activity among all catalysts, with TOFs 2–5 times higher than that of the Pd
p
y
/ND catalysts, suggesting that the fully exposed palladium clusters are the most reactive structure for the reaction. As the Pd
1
species are relatively inactive, they act like spectators in the reaction. For Pd
n
x
/ND and Pd
p
y
/ND, which contain mixtures of active palladium ensembles (clusters or particles) and inactive Pd
1
single atoms, the presence of the latter has attenuated the intrinsic activity of the active palladium ensembles in terms of palladium-normalized activity or TOF as shown in Fig.
4a
. To account for this, we have subtracted the contribution of Pd
1
on Pd
n
x
/ND and Pd
p
y
/ND and obtained the site-specific TOF of palladium ensembles as a function of their
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
(Fig.
4b
). The graph of site-specific TOFs versus
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
shows a volcano-shaped profile with the highest activity corresponding to ensembles with coordination numbers of
∼
2–4.5. More specifically, the highest site-specific TOF reaches 235.2 min
−1
over the ensemble with a
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
of 4.4, which is 24 and 7 times higher than that of the Pd
1
and Pd
p3
, respectively. Importantly, the corresponding catalyst, Pd
n2
/ND, has a palladium-normalized activity of 143.8 min
−1
, which is around 6 times higher than reported previously (Supplementary Table
7
)
5
,
7
,
8
,
38
,
39
,
40
. This shows that the fully exposed palladium clusters with a
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
of
∼
4.4 are the optimal active sites with the highest reactivity (note that the
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
of 4.4 represents the averaged structural feature for the optimal catalyst). Moreover, it is also noticeable that the Pd
n1
with smaller ensemble size (
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}=1.9\)
) exhibits a similar TOF to that of Pd
n2
, suggesting that the initial dehydrogenation of DNEC to ONEC could be realized by just a few continuous palladium atoms.

Next, the performance of catalysts in TNEC dehydrogenation was investigated (Fig.
4c
). It has been widely acknowledged that the dehydrogenation of TNEC to NEC is the rate-limiting step in the whole dehydrogenation process (Fig.
1
)
5
,
41
. Consistent with this, our results show that the dehydrogenation rate of TNEC is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the DNEC. Despite the huge difference in kinetics, a similar trend in the catalysts’ performance was observed, that is, the Pd
1
/ND catalyst has very low reactivity, and the most active catalyst (by TOF) for TNEC dehydrogenation is Pd
n2
/ND. Likewise, after subtracting the contribution of Pd
1
from Pd
n
x
/ND and Pd
p
y
/ND, the correlation between site-specific TOFs and
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
was established (Fig.
4d
). Notably, while the Pd
n2
is still several times more active than Pd
p
y
, the TOF of Pd
n1
drops to only half of that of Pd
n2
, in sharp contrast to the similar reactivity of Pd
n1
and Pd
n2
in the first dehydrogenation of DNEC. This result also clearly indicates the different ensemble-requirements for atomic palladium sites in the first and last dehydrogenation steps of DNEC. In addition, the structural stability of the optimal fully exposed palladium clusters was also confirmed. After five cyclic dehydrogenation evaluations at 453 K, no obvious structural variation was observed for Pd
n2
/ND (Supplementary Figs.
16
–
18
). Furthermore, the Pd
n3
/ND catalyst (1.4 wt%, with a
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
of
∼
4.7) exhibited good stability and H
2
recovery applicability in multiple cyclic tests (Supplementary Figs.
19
and
20
), demonstrating the relative robustness of this fully exposed palladium cluster catalyst.
So far, the collective results suggest that to trigger the facile dehydrogenation for both DNEC and TNEC substrates, the presence of a palladium ensemble is indispensable, while palladium single atoms are almost inactive. In addition, compared with catalysts with palladium particles, the Pd
n2
/ND catalyst containing fully exposed atomic-layered palladium clusters with
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\approx 4.4\)
, with a higher surface density of metal active sites and fewer bulk atoms, is estimated to be able to catalyse all the dehydrogenation steps with higher atomic efficiency and intrinsic activity (
Supplementary Note 5
). Additionally, for the dehydrogenation of DNEC, it is highly desirable to precisely fabricate catalysts with only the fully exposed atomic-layered metal clusters and without the presence of spectators such as the single palladium atoms in the present case. Furthermore, the extension of the concept of fully exposed metal clusters would allow for the design of advanced metal catalysts to achieve a higher mass-specific activity without wasting the metal loading inside particles or as inactive single atoms, which is extremely important for the design of noble metal catalysts for industrial applications

Computational studies
To gain deeper insights into the structure sensitivity of palladium species with different atomicities, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The reaction path and the corresponding energy profiles of DNEC dehydrogenation to liberate one H
2
molecule over Pd
1
/G, Pd
13
/G and Pd(111) were first studied (Fig.
5
and Supplementary Fig.
21
). Compared with Pd
13
/G and Pd(111), the activation of the first C–H bond (that is, the axial C–H bond adjacent to the nitrogen atom within the five-membered pyrrolidine ring) of DNEC on Pd
1
/G requires a higher energy barrier to be overcome (1.54 eV), which could be the consequence of the insufficient metallic state of the Pd
1
δ+
sites. In addition, due to the lack of a continuous palladium ensemble, once the first C–H bond scission is completed, the resulting Pd
1
–H hydride must transfer the hydrogen atom to the adjacent support to accommodate the *C
14
NH
24
(* denotes the adsorbed state); however, the higher energy barrier (1.28 eV) also makes this step kinetically difficult to achieve. As for Pd(111), although it can activate scission of the first two C–H bonds as efficiently as Pd
13
/G in kinetic terms, from the thermodynamic viewpoint, the very strong bonding to DNEC makes the dehydrogenation process less favourable than that of the Pd
13
/G, leading to the attenuated TOF over large palladium particle sites. For the TNEC dehydrogenation step, a similar trend in ensemble requirement has been noticed (Supplementary Fig.
22
). Importantly, the lack of sufficient palladium ensemble sites and the excessively high bonding strength between NEC and large palladium crystalline surface both suppressed the dehydrogenation process (see Supplementary Note 6 for more discussion). It should be pointed out that even metal clusters with the same atomicity (with the same
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}}\)
, in the current case, 4.4) may adopt different configurations, and may have relatively different catalytic performances. This needs to be studied in detail in the future.

Conclusions
The structure sensitivity of supported palladium species ranging from the nanoscale to the atomic scale was investigated in the catalytic dehydrogenation of DNEC as a representative hydrogen carrier. Through structural elucidation and speciation of the site distributions of palladium, fully exposed atomic-layered palladium clusters with a
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\)
of
∼
4.4 were identified as the optimal palladium species, exhibiting higher atomic efficiency and intrinsic activity compared with larger palladium particles (
\({\overline{\mathrm{CN}}} _{{\mathrm{Pd}}\mbox{--}{\mathrm{Pd}}}\geq6.9\)
). Conversely, the cationic palladium single atoms exhibit the lowest activity, making them behave like spectators in the reaction. DFT results show that without a sufficient number of continuous palladium sites, the reactants cannot be activated effectively, whereas the strong bonding between products and the metallic palladium crystalline surface makes the desorption process sluggish. With the combined higher metal dispersion, unique electronic properties and suitable ensemble size, both the reactants’ activation and the products’ desorption are favourable over the fully exposed atomic-layered palladium clusters. Our study points out the importance of balancing the atomic dispersion and ensemble requirement in the design of practical catalysts to achieve higher metal- and mass-normalized catalytic efficiencies simultaneously.
Methods
Synthesis of Pd/ND catalysts
Six Pd/ND catalysts with distinct palladium geometries and dispersion states were synthesized by varying the palladium weight loadings or wet-chemistry synthetic methods. For the synthesis of Pd
1
/ND and Pd
n
x
/ND (
x
= 1, 2), typically, 200 mg ND (99.9% purity, Beijing Grish Hitech) was first dispersed in 45 ml deionized water in a 100 ml round-bottom flask, followed by 30 min sonication to achieve a homogeneous suspension. Then, the flask was immersed into a 100 °C oil bath after the pH value of the ND suspension was adjusted to ~10 by using freshly prepared Na
2
CO
3
solution (0.25 M). Afterwards, 5 ml of freshly pH-neutralized Pd(NO
3
)
2
solution of various concentrations was added dropwise to the stirring ND suspension and kept at 100 °C for 1 h under continuous stirring. Finally, these as-prepared Pd/ND samples were dried under vacuum at 60 °C after washing twice with deionized water.
The synthesis of samples with larger crystalline palladium NPs as the dominant geometries (that is, Pd
p
y
/ND,
y
= 1, 2, 3) was realized by either the incipient-wetness impregnation method (Pd
p1
/ND and Pd
p3
/ND) or chemical reduction methods (Pd
p2
/ND). For the synthesis of Pd
p1
/ND, 200 mg ND was wetted by 800 μl diluted Pd(NO
3
)
2
solution in a 10 ml crucible, then the slurry was stirred slowly at room temperature overnight and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. For the synthesis of Pd
p3
/ND, 800 μl diluted Pd(NO
3
)
2
solution with an additional 120 mg citric acid was used to wet 200 mg ND. Afterwards, the slurry was stirred at room temperature overnight and dried at 120 °C for 12 h. The synthesis of Pd
p2
/ND was based on a previous publication with some modifications
45
. In a typical synthesis, 540 μl PdCl
2
–HCl solution (10 mg PdCl
2
dissolved in 1 ml 0.4 M HCl) was mixed with 0.30 mmol trisodium citrate in 80 ml deionized water, then 200 mg ND was added to the above solution, followed by 30 min sonication to achieve a homogeneous suspension. A newly prepared 10 ml NaBH
4
solution (0.1 M) was then added dropwise to the above suspension under stirring at 60 °C and the stirring was continued at 60 °C for 6 h. Finally, the as-prepared sample was washed three times with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
After drying, different catalyst precursors were reduced by diluted H
2
(10% H
2
/Ar, 30 ml min
−1
) at 573 K (except for Pd
1
/ND, for which the reduction temperature was set at 473 K to prevent the aggregation of Pd
1
sites) for 1 h, followed with passivation treatment at room temperature with diluted O
2
(0.5 % O
2
/Ar, 30 ml min
−1
) for 12 h.
Catalyst characterization
The H
2
–O
2
titration used to determine the metal dispersion of Pd/ND catalysts was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In a typical test, 100 mg of passivated catalyst was placed in a quartz tube reactor and activated in 8% H
2
/Ar (30 ml min
−1
) at 200 °C for 2 h; the catalyst was then purged with helium (30 ml min
−1
) at the same temperature for another 0.5 h, after which it was cooled down to 50 °C. Subsequently, the O
2
titration of the catalyst was performed by pulsing 1 ml 5% O
2
/He into the reactor several times at 50 °C until the consumption of O
2
became negligible. Then, H
2
titration was carried out in the same way, pulsing 1 ml 8% H
2
/Ar into the reactor several times to reach an equilibrium adsorption. The consumption of H
2
was used to determine the palladium dispersion (
D
%) according to equation (
1
), in which
N
H2
,
e
Pd–H2
,
M
Pd
and
W

are the consumption of H

) and (

, the atomic weight of elemental palladium (106.4 g mol

) and the weight of palladium (g) in each catalyst, respectively.
$$D\% = ({N_{{\rm{H2}}}} \times {e_{{\rm{Pd}}-{\rm{H2}}}} \times {M_{{\rm{Pd}}}}/{W_{{\rm{Pd}}}}/22,414) \times 100\%$$

$$2{\rm{P}}{{\rm{d}}_{{\rm{surface}}}} + {{\rm{O}}_2} = 2{\rm{P}}{{\rm{d}}_{{\rm{surface}}}}{{\rm{O}}_{{\rm{ads}}}}\left( {{\rm{oxygen chemisorption}}} \right)$$
(2)
$$2{\rm{P}}{{\rm{d}}_{{\rm{surface}}}}{{\rm{O}}_{{\rm{ads}}}} + 3{{\rm{H}}_{\rm{2}}} = 2{\rm{P}}{{\rm{d}}_{{\rm{surface}}}}{{\rm{H}}_{{\rm{ads}}}} + 2{{\rm{H}}_2}{\rm{O}}\left( {{\rm{hydrogen titration}}} \right)$$
(3)
The stoichiometry factor between palladium and H
2
is based on the study of Benson and Boudart
23
, and can be affected by possible formation of β-phase PdH
x
hydrides, which may lead to overestimation of the true dispersion. The tendency for β-phase hydride formation, however, decreases with decreasing palladium particle size
46
, and vanishes at sizes of <2.6 nm at 298 K even at a high hydrogen pressure of 1 atm
47
. During our H
2
–O
2
titration measurement, a low H
2
partial pressure (8 kPa) was used in both pretreatment and titration steps. Under this pressure, negligible formation of β-phase PdH
x
hydride occurs on Pd
1
/ND and Pd
n
x
/ND because palladium atoms are fully dispersed. As for the three Pd
p
y
/ND catalysts, the possible H
2
solubility into palladium particles may affect the measured dispersion values by 5–12%
46
. These deviations in the metal dispersion of the Pd
py
/ND catalysts do not influence the overall structure–function correlations reported here.
The high-angle angular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and electron energy-loss spectra were acquired using a Nion HERMES-100 electron microscope operated at 60 kV. The
Z
-contrast HAADF images were collected with an annular dark-field detector in the range of 75–200 mrad with a convergence angle of 30 mrad. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy was carried out with the same experimental set-up. All reduced then passivated samples for electron microscopy characterization were prepared by directly dropping the ethanol-diluted sample suspension on TEM grids coated with holey carbon film.
The CO-adsorption DRIFT spectra of different Pd/ND catalysts were recorded on a Bruker VERTEX 70v spectrometer equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled mercury–cadmium–telluride detector and an in situ Praying Mantis diffuse reflection reaction cell (Harrick Scientific). In a typical measurement, about 30 mg of passivated Pd/ND sample was packed smoothly in the sample cup within the reaction cell and subjected to reduction pretreatment (the prereduction conditions for different Pd/ND catalysts used for this test are equivalent to those of the catalytic evaluation tests). After reduction, the reaction cell was cooled to 298 K under a purge of argon flow (30 ml min
−1
), and a spectrum was then recorded as background. Subsequently, a gas flow of 5% CO/Ar (30 ml min
−1
) was introduced into the reaction cell. Once the adsorption was completed (that is, the intensity of CO-adsorption bands no longer increased), the inlet flow was switched to argon (30 ml min
−1
) and the spectrum was continuously recorded at 298 K.
Based on identification of the sites and corresponding integration results (Fig.
2g
and Supplementary Tables
2
–
4
), the site fraction of Pd
1
(
F
Pd1
) on catalysts could be described by equation (
4
), in which
A
,
ε
and
S
represent peak areas, extinct coefficients and CO/Pd stoichiometries (
S
linear
= 1,
S
bridge
= 1/2), respectively
48
. According to previous reports, the extinct coefficient of bridge-bonded CO is about one magnitude greater than that of the linear-bonded CO (
ε
bridge
≈ 10 ×
ε
linear
)
31
,
32
. Under this approximation, the
F
Pd1
could be quantitatively determined (Table
1
). To check whether the extinction coefficient assumption is reliable for our system, a sensitivity analysis that uses
ε
linear-Pd1
as a single variable was performed (see Supplementary Table
6
and Supplementary Note 4 for more details).
$$\begin{array}{l}F_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}1}\\ = \frac{{{{A}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}1}/(\varepsilon _{{{{\mathrm{linear}}}}} \times {{S}}_{{{{\mathrm{linear}}}}})}}{{{{A}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}1}{{{\mathrm{/}}}}(\varepsilon _{{{{\mathrm{linear}}}}} \times {{S}}_{{{{\mathrm{linear}}}}}) + {{A}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pdn/p}}}}}/(\varepsilon _{{{{\mathrm{linear}}}}} \times{{S}}_{{{{\mathrm{linear}}}}}) + {{A}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pdn/p}}}}}/(\varepsilon _{{{{\mathrm{bridge}}}}} \times {{S}}_{{{{\mathrm{bridge}}}}})}} \times 100\end{array}$$

The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) Pd K edge (24,350 eV) measurement was performed at the beamline BL14W1 station of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The output beam was tuned by a Si(311) double-crystal monochromator and the energy was calibrated with palladium foil. Before the measurement, all Pd/ND samples were prereduced and transferred into a glovebox for pelleting and sealing (the prereduction conditions of the different Pd/ND catalysts used for this test are equivalent to those of the catalytic evaluation tests). The XAFS spectrum was collected under fluorescence mode using a Lytle detector, and all XAFS spectra were processed and analysed by the Ifeffit package.
Because the EXAFS measurement provides sample-averaged information about the targeted metal species, the fitted Pd–Pd coordination numbers (CN
Pd–Pd
) for Pd
n
x
/ND and Pd
p
y
/ND are therefore a collective result of the CNs of Pd
1
and Pd
n/p
times their respective atomic ratios (that is,
N
Pd1
/
N
total
and
N
Pdn/p
/
N
total
in equation (

)). After subtracting the weightings of Pd
1
sites, the site-averaged Pd–Pd CN (
\(\overline {{{{\mathrm{C}}}}{{{\mathrm{N}}}}{{{\mathrm{}}}}} _{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}} - {{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}}\)
) of Pd
n/p
in Pd
n

/ND and Pd
p
y
/ND could be calculated by equations (

)–(

).
$${{{\mathrm{C}}}}{{{\mathrm{N}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}} - {{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}} = 0 \times ({{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}1}/{{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{total}}}}}) + ({\mathrm{\overline{CN}}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}} - {{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}})_{{{{\mathrm{n}}}}/{{{\mathrm{p}}}}} \times ({{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pdn}}}}/{{{\mathrm{p}}}}}/{{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{total}}}}})$$
(5)
$$\begin{array}{l}{{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pdn}}}}/{{{\mathrm{p}}}}}/{{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{total}}}}} = 1-\left( {{{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}1}/{{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{total}}}}}} \right)\\ = 1-\left( {{{N}}_{{{Pd}}1} \times {{D}}\% /{{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{surface}}}}}} \right) = 1-{{F}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}1} \times {{D}}\%\end{array}$$
(6)
$$({\mathrm{\overline {CN}}} _{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}} - {{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}})_{{{{\mathrm{n}}}}/{{{\mathrm{p}}}}} = {{{\mathrm{C}}}}{{{\mathrm{N}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}} - {{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}}/({{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pdn}}}}/{{{\mathrm{p}}}}}/{{N}}_{{{{\mathrm{total}}}}}) = {{{\mathrm{C}}}}{{{\mathrm{N}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}} - {{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}}/(1-{{F}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}1} \times {{D}}\% )$$

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an AXIS Ultra photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical) using monochromatized Al Kα radiation. Before performing the measurement, all reduced catalysts were transferred into a glovebox where the catalysts were pelleted and sealed within the XPS sample holder (the prereduction conditions of the different Pd/ND catalysts used for this test are equivalent to those of the catalytic evaluation tests). Subsequently, the reduced catalysts were transferred into an ultra-high-vacuum chamber for XPS measurement via the sample holder. After the measurement, all spectra were calibrated based on the diamond
sp
3
carbon feature (286.8 eV).
X-ray diffraction analysis was performed on a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (40 kV and 40 mA). The practical weight loading amounts of palladium on different catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (Leeman-Prodigy 7).
Catalytic evaluation measurement
Before performing the catalytic evaluation, 30 mg passivated Pd/ND catalyst was activated in 10% H
2
/Ar (30 ml min
−1
) for 1 h at the desired temperatures (473 K for Pd
1
/ND, 573 K for Pd
n
x
/ND and Pd
p
y
/ND). Then, without exposure to air, the activated catalyst was instantly mixed with a certain amount of DNEC–decalin solution (1.0 mol l
−1
) in a two-neck flask (equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser). The dehydrogenation reaction was carried out at 443 K by immersing the flask in a heating oil bath. During the dehydrogenation process, a continuous purging of argon (40 ml min
−1
) was introduced into the flask to remove the produced H
2
from the system and maintain the atmospheric pressure within the flask. The dehydrogenation procedures of TNEC over different Pd/ND catalysts was similar, except the concentration of TNEC–decalin solution was reduced to 0.5 mol l
−1
.
After each dehydrogenation reaction, the liquid phase was separated from catalysts by centrifugation and the products were quantitatively analysed by an Agilent 7820 gas chromatograph equipped with a HP-5 capillary column and a flame ionization detector.
The site-specific TOFs of Pd
n
x
and Pd
p
y
were calculated based on equation (
8
), where TOF
Pd1
is the TOF of the Pd
1
/ND catalyst and
F
Pd1
is the site fraction of isolated palladium single-atom sites.
$${{{\mathrm{TOF}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{catalyst}}}}} = {{{\mathrm{TOF}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pdn}}}}/{{{\mathrm{p}}}}} \times \left( {1-{{F}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}1}} \right) + {{{\mathrm{TOF}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}1} \times{{F}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}1}$$

Computational details
DFT calculations were performed to determine the adsorption energies and energy barriers of different removal steps using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)
49
,
50
,
51
,
52
. We used the projector-augmented wave method to describe the interactions between ion cores and valence electrons
53
, and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation to describe the exchange-correlation functional
54
,
55
. The solution of the Kohn–Sham equations was expanded in a plane-wave basis set with a cut-off energy of 500 eV. The self-consistent electronic iteration proceeds until the total energy is converged to 10
−5
eV with spin-polarized calculation. A supercell of 17.2 Å × 17.2 Å × 35.0 Å with periodic boundary conditions was used for all the systems.
The adsorption energies of the reactants and intermediates were calculated on a Pd(111) surface that consists of three palladium layers (36 palladium atoms per layer; 108 atoms in total) and a 30 Å vacuum gap. Only the top layer of the slab was allowed to relax. Brillouin zone sampling was performed using a Monkhorst–Pack grid
56
, and electronic occupancies were determined by the second-order Methfessel–Paxton method with a width of 0.2 eV. All of the palladium atoms supported on the divacancy sites of graphene models are constructed based on the graphene basal plane model. The supercell used for graphene with divacancies consists of 96 carbon atoms with 2 carbon atom vacancies at the centre.
In all the calculations, a force-based conjugated gradient method was used to optimize the geometries
57
. Monkhorst–Pack meshes of 2 × 2 × 1
k
-point samplings in the surface Brillouin zones were used for all the models. Saddle points and minima were considered to be converged when the maximum force in each degree of freedom was less than 0.02 eV Å
−1
. Bader charge analysis was implemented with a fast algorithm developed by Henkelman and co-workers, and the core charges were included in the partitions
58
,
59
. The isolated adsorbates were optimized in the supercell in which the Brillouin zone integration was carried out for the Γ point only, and electronic occupancies were determined in light of a Gaussian smearing with a width of 0.01 eV.
Adsorption energies were determined as
E
adsorption
=
E
adsorbed molecule/surface
−
E
molecule in vacuum
−
E
surface
, where
E
adsorbed molecule/surface
is the energy of the adsorption system,
E
molecule in vacuum
is the energy of the adsorbed molecule in vacuum and
E
surface
is the energy of the surface. The transition states and corresponding activation energies were obtained by the nudged elastic band method.
The stretching frequencies of CO were calculated within the harmonic approximation. Only those components of the Hessian matrix are calculated for which the selective dynamics tags are set to .TRUE. in the POSCAR file. POTIM is set to 0.015 Å. All atoms are fixed except CO and its first nearest atoms. For the orbital analysis, the Brillouin zone is sampled by 3 × 3 × 1
k
-points using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme for electronic property calculations by the tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections.
