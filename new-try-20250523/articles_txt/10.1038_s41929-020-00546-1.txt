Abstract
The development of catalysts free of platinum-group metals and with both a high activity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction in proton exchange membrane fuel cells is a grand challenge. Here we report an atomically dispersed Co and N co-doped carbon (Co–N–C) catalyst with a high catalytic oxygen reduction reaction activity comparable to that of a similarly synthesized Fe–N–C catalyst but with a four-time enhanced durability. The Co–N–C catalyst achieved a current density of 0.022 A cm

fuel cells, higher than that of non-iron platinum-group-metal-free catalysts reported in the literature. Importantly, we identified two main degradation mechanisms for metal (M)–N–C catalysts: catalyst oxidation by radicals and active-site demetallation. The enhanced durability of Co–N–C relative to Fe–N–C is attributed to the lower activity of Co ions for Fenton reactions that produce radicals from the main oxygen reduction reaction by-product, H
2

, and the significantly enhanced resistance to demetallation of Co–N–C.

Main
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are high-efficiency, clean energy conversion devices that require highly active catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode
1
,
2
. Platinum-group metals (PGMs) have the highest ORR activity and are currently used as the cathode catalysts in PEM fuel cells
3
,
4
,
5
; they account for approximately half of the total PEM fuel cell cost under mass production
6
and the high cost precludes their large-scale application. Transition metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon (M–N–C, M = Fe, Co, Mn, Sn and so on
7
,
8
) catalysts are the most promising alternatives to PGM catalysts, yet they are not efficient enough in acidic media because of the sluggish ORR kinetics and they are not durable enough for practical applications
9
. Considerable effort has therefore been invested in overcoming these problems, with efforts focused, in part, on modifying the catalysts’ structures and the chemistry of M–N–C (refs
10
,
11
). The formation of atomically dispersed M–N–C catalytic sites and maximizing their volumetric density have emerged as effective approaches to improve the ORR activity
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
. In particular, single-atom Fe–N–C catalysts have been extensively studied and have demonstrated high ORR activity
16
,
17
,
18
. However, Fe–N–C catalysts tend to degrade quickly in the oxidizing, acidic PEM fuel cell environment
19
. The degradation mechanisms remain elusive and need further investigation, even though several mechanisms, such as carbon oxidation by hydroxyl and/or hydroperoxyl radicals
20
,
21
, demetallation of Fe active sites
22
,
23
and an increase in mass- and/or charge-transport resistance
24
, have been proposed. Even worse, the dissolved Fe ions from Fe–N–C are detrimental to fuel cells’ durability as they catalyse radical formation from H
2
O
2
through Fenton reactions and the radicals degrade the organic ionomers and membranes
25
,
26
as well as the Fe–N–C catalyst itself
27
,
28
. Therefore, the replacement of Fe with metals that do not catalyse Fenton reactions is necessary, with Co being the most investigated
29
. Nevertheless, to date, Co–N–C catalysts have exhibited inferior ORR activity and higher yields of the product of the two-electron (2e
−
) reduction of oxygen, H
2
O
2
, than Fe–N–C catalysts.
To improve the ORR activity of Co–N–C catalysts, one can increase the density of the CoN
x
sites considered to be catalytically active
30
. However, previous works indicate that increasing the Co content in the catalyst precursors typically leads to the formation of Co nanoparticles, which are not active for the ORR, and consumes Co atoms that would otherwise be available for the CoN
x
site formation
31
,
32
. The configuration between Co, N and C is one of the key factors to affect ORR activity. Previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted that the coordination state of CoN
x
determines the electronic structure of Co, which significantly affects the binding energy of the oxygen species (for example, O
2
, H
2
O
2
, OH* and OOH*) with the Co centre and thus leads to variations in ORR activity
33
,
34
. Experimentalists identified possible active site structures created using various synthetic approaches
30
,
34
,
35
. These studies suggest that increasing the density of CoN
x
sites and manipulating the Co–N coordination in Co–N–C catalysts should improve their ORR catalytic activity.
Conventional synthetic approaches that involve pyrolysis of the mixtures of Co, N and C precursors often result in a heterogeneous local environment for the CoN
x
site
36
,
37
,
38
. Zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIF-8) were recently used as effective precursors to synthesize Co–N–C catalysts due to their capability to yield CoN
x
sites and form porous structures during the pyrolysis
39
. Their high surface area and abundant micropores offer the flexibility to dope Co-containing molecules or Co ions into the structure
40
, and thus represent an attractive direction for further optimization of the Co–N–C catalysts.
Here we report a single-atom Co–N–C catalyst synthesized by introducing and maintaining a high content of atomic CoN
x
sites to enhance the ORR activity in an acidic environment. Our approach is to increase the density of single Co sites by immobilizing the ligand-chelated CoN
x
moieties in the micropores of ZIF-8 through a solution synthesis pathway, distinct from previous works in which Co was doped into ZIF-8 through a Co–Zn ion exchange
32
,
41
. In our approach, we take advantage of ZIF-8’s unique hydrocarbon networks that function as protective fences between individual Co atoms, which decrease their mobility and avoid Co agglomeration. The CoN
x
moieties in the ZIF-8 micropores are directly converted into CoN
x
sites with high-temperature pyrolysis. Our extensive physical characterization reveals a high density of atomically dispersed Co and the CoN
x
structure is believed to be porphyrin like, CoN

fuel cell tests, which are the highest fuel cell activities reported for non-Fe M–N–C cathodes (Supplementary Table
1
). Further, the Co–N–C catalyst was found to be much more durable than an Fe–N–C catalyst synthesized using the same approach, and this superior durability is attributed to the lower activity of Co ions for the Fenton reactions (and thus lower rates of radical formation and catalyst attack by the radicals) and the significantly enhanced resistance to demetallation of the Co–N–C. We identified important differences in the demetallation of Co–N–C versus Fe–N–C, as Co–N–C demonstrates a fivefold reduced demetallation. We also observed that the presence of oxygen in the environment dramatically increases demetallation for Fe–N–C, consistent with our theoretical simulation results.
Results
Electrocatalyst synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of Co–N–C catalysts is schematically shown in Fig.
1a
. We introduced Co during the growth of ZIF-8 by adding Co(acac)
3
(acac, acetylacetonate) and Zn(NO
3
)
2
·6H
2
O together with 2-methylimidazole (mIm) in methanol. The ZIF-8 networks were formed with the assembly of Zn
2+
and mIm, and Co(acac)
3
molecules were encapsulated in ZIF-8 micropores (denoted as Co(acac)
3
@ZIF-8) (Supplementary Fig.
1
). Fourier difference analysis from powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) confirms the formation of ZIF-8 and the presence of a guest molecule, that is, Co(acac)
3
, in the ZIF-8 micropores as a result of encapsulation (Supplementary Fig.
2
and Supplementary Note
1
). The absence of the PXRD peaks characteristic of Co(acac)
3
indicates that it was not present as a separate crystalline entity. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis indicates that the Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum for Co(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 is the same as that for Co(acac)
3
(Supplementary Fig.
3
and Supplementary Note
2
) and differs from that for Co-doped ZIF-8
42
. This confirms that Co(acac)
3
molecules were confined in the ZIF-8 micropores and that direct Co doping into ZIF-8 did not occur. Moreover, the pore size distribution analysis shows a substantial diminution of 9–13 Å and the formation of 13–17 Å micropores in Co(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 as compared with those of bare ZIF-8 (Supplementary Fig.
4
), and thermogravimetric analysis shows that the stability of Co(acac)
3
in Co(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 was enhanced compared with that of Co(acac)
3
(Supplementary Fig.

), which provides additional evidence for such an encapsulation

@ZIF-8 into Co(mIm)
4
@ZIF-8 through ligand exchange (acac to mIm). XANES analyses confirm the successful ligand exchange (Supplementary Fig.

), which was also evidenced by a distinct colour change of the precursors from sage green for Co(acac)

@ZIF-8 to purple for Co(mIm)

) of Co(mIm)
4
@ZIF-8 show characteristics that are similar to those of Co(acac)
3
@ZIF-8, which indicates that Co(mIm)
4
is encapsulated in the ZIF-8 micropores. Co(mIm)
4
@ZIF-8 precursors were pyrolysed at 1,000 °C under an Ar gas atmosphere. The Zn in ZIF-8 easily evaporates at temperatures above 950 °C, and Co(mIm)
4
within the ZIF-8 micropores is directly converted into atomically dispersed CoN
x
sites in porous carbon (this catalyst is designated as Co(mIm)–NC(1.0, 1.0 means at% of Co in the catalyst)). During the pyrolysis, the hydrocarbon networks of ZIF-8 served as a protective fence to prevent Co agglomeration. To understand the role of the ligand exchange, the Co(acac)–NC(1.0) catalyst was also synthesized by the same method but without the acac to mIm ligand exchange of the Co(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 precursors.
Figure

shows the morphology of the Co(mIm)–NC(1.0): a rhombododecahedron shape and a rough surface. Highly disordered carbons with randomly oriented graphitic domains and less dense, pore-like morphologies are observed in the bright-field (BF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image (Fig. 1c). High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM images (Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
7a,b
) indicate that Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) is rich in atomic Co sites. PXRD results verify the absence of a detectable amount of crystalline Co phases, which indicates that Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) is substantially free of metallic Co or Co carbide (Supplementary Fig.
2
). The electron energy loss point spectrum, taken by placing the electron probe directly on a single atom, as shown in the inset to Fig.
1e
by the bright dot (red cross) in the HAADF-STEM image, shows the co-location of Co and N, which suggests that single Co atoms are coordinated by N (ref.
32
). Quantitative elemental analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary Table
2
) and STEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
8
) reveal that the Co content in the Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) is 1.0 at%, which is among the highest when compared with those of other non-Fe M–N–C ORR catalysts for an acidic environment
34
,
41
. No Fe or Mn was detected in Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) by XPS (Supplementary Table
2
), which was further confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES; Supplementary Table
3
). By contrast, Co(acac)–NC(1.0) showed a similar Co content as that of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0), but with less single-atom Co (Co clusters co-existing with atomically dispersed Co) (Supplementary Fig.
7c,d
), as further confirmed by PXRD (Supplementary Fig.
2
) and XAS (Supplementary Fig.
9
and Supplementary Note
3
) analysis. Note that Co in Co(acac)
3
is not directly coordinated with N, Co–N coordination in Co(acac)–NC(1.0) must arise from the ZIF-8 ligand. Meanwhile, the formation of a heterogeneous structure of the Co(acac)–NC(1.0) catalyst is probably due to Co(acac)
3
decomposition at relative low temperatures (Supplementary Fig.
5
)
45
to form Co atoms that may be mobile at a high temperature and thereby aggregate into Co clusters.
Further evidence for CoN
x
coordination and information as to the local chemical environment were obtained from XAS. As shown in Fig.
2a
, the Co K-edge XANES spectrum edge energy (~7,730 eV) for Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) is similar to that for the Co
ii
reference samples, which shows that the valence state of Co in Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) is 2+, consistent with previous results
30
,
34
,
46
. Careful examination of the pre-edge region 7,708–7,710 eV shows that Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) shows a higher pre-edge peak intensity compared with that of octahedral Co
ii
(NO
3
)
2
·6H
2
O (ref.
34
) and square planar Co
ii
phthalocyanine
47
. This indicates that Co in Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) is in a less centrosymmetric coordination environment, for example, non-planar CoN
x
, than those in the literature cited. A comparison of our experimental XANES spectrum with the XANES simulation of Zitolo et al.
30
further indicates that the XANES region of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) best matches that of CoN
x
in a micropore-hosted porphyrinic coordination environment, that is, non-planar CoN
4
C
12
(Supplementary Fig.

). From both the Fe Mössbauer spectroscopic and XANES analyses (Supplementary Fig.
11
and Supplementary Note
4
), a similarly synthesized Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) catalyst that has a similar atomic metal dispersion and carbon structure (Supplementary Fig.
12
) to that of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) also has a micropore-hosted porphyrin-like FeN

The Fourier transform (FT) of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum for Co(mIm)–NC(1.0), which has not been phase corrected, exhibits a prominent peak at ~1.4 Å corresponding to the first coordination shell of CoN
x
(Fig.
2b
)
30
,
49
. The coordination number (CN) of CoN
x
, derived from the EXAFS fit, is 3.9 ± 0.5 and the Co–N bond length is 1.93 ± 0.01 Å (Supplementary Table
4
), which indicates the dominant CoN
x
in Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) is CoN
4
. A very minor Co–Co peak arising from Co metal is also evident at >2 Å in the FT. Further analysis of the CN for this scattering path and comparison with that of metallic Co foil shows that metallic Co comprises ~4% of the total Co in the catalyst (Supplementary Table
4
). The lack of second-shell scattering indicates that the Co clusters are small, consistent with the PXRD (Supplementary Fig.
2
) and HAADF-STEM (Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
7
) results, which show that the vast majority of Co is atomically dispersed. Both the Co–N and the Co–Co scattering paths are observed in the FT of the EXAFS of Co(acac)–NC(1.0); however, unlike Co(mIm)–NC(1.0), a notable amount of Co–Co scattering is observed, estimated to be ~11% of the total Co. Second-shell scattering was observed for Co(acac)–NC(1.0), which indicates that the Co clusters are larger than in Co(mIm)–NC(1.0). This is consistent with the observation from the STEM images, which show both atomic CoN
x
sites and Co clusters (Supplementary Fig.
7
), and from the PXRD results, which show the presence of crystalline Co (Supplementary Fig.
2
).
Micropores are known to host the majority of MN

52
. Surface area analysis shows similar Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas and dominant micropore surface areas for all the Co catalysts (Supplementary Table
5
). An in-depth micropore distribution analysis from the non-local DFT method shows a substantial diminution of 9–13 Å micropores in Co(mIm)–NC with a systematic increase in the Co doping content from 0.28 to 1.0 at% (Fig.
2c
), as compared with that of NC derived from bare ZIF-8, which can be interpreted as indicative of micropore-hosted CoN
4
sites that inhabit the micropores of NC. MN

ORR activity
The ORR activity of catalysts was first evaluated in O
2
-saturated 0.5 M H
2
SO
4
using the RRDE technique. Without Co doping, the NC catalyst showed a poor activity with a very low onset potential (
E
onset
,
E
at a current density of 0.1 mA cm
−2
) of 0.78 V and
E
1/2
of only 0.61 V versus RHE (Fig.
3a
). By contrast, Co doping significantly enhanced the ORR activity. Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) exhibited a high ORR activity with an
E
onset
of 0.93 V and
E
1/2
of 0.82 V, which are only ~25 and ~35 mV, respectively, less than that of the Pt/C catalyst (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan Carbon, Fuel Cell Store), albeit with a ten times lower loading for the Pt (that is, 600 µg cm
−2
for the M–N–C catalysts versus 60 µg cm
−2
for Pt). This ORR activity is among the best for a non-Fe PGM-free ORR catalyst in acids (Supplementary Table
6
). Co(acac)–NC(1.0) exhibits an
E
onset
of 0.86 V and an
E
1/2
of 0.77 V, both much lower than that of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0), which indicates that the ligand exchange step leads to an improved ORR activity. The influence of the Co doping amount on the ORR activity was also investigated. The activity was found to increase continuously with increasing Co content (Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Fig.
13
) in the catalyst. This indicates that the ORR activity is directly related to the CoN
4
concentration as the majority of Co in Co(mIm)–NC is atomic Co in the form of porphyrin-like CoN
4
C
12
, as evidenced from the above HAADF-STEM, XRD, XANES and pore distribution analyses. We note that 1.0 at% is the highest Co content for Co(mIm)–NC that we could obtain using our current synthesis method, most probably due to limitations in the amount of Co(acac)
3
that could be encapsulated in ZIF-8 micropores during precursor synthesis (Supplementary Table
3
). Further improvement is expected through the development of new approaches to encapsulate more Co(acac)
3
in the ZIF-8 host. The H
2
O
2
yield of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) is below 1.5% (Fig.
3b
), as determined by RRDE tests, which indicates a dominant four-electron (4e
−
) ORR pathway. This H
2
O
2
yield is lower than those previously reported for Co–N–C catalysts (Supplementary Fig.
14
). When the catalyst loading on the disk electrode was decreased from 600 to 37.5 µg cm
−2
, the H
2
O
2
yield remained very low (<5%) (Supplementary Fig.
14
), which confirms the predominantly 4e

ORR pathway.

2
/air conditions, the fuel cell generated a peak power density of 0.32 W cm

, among the highest performance reported for a non-Fe PGM-free PEM fuel cell cathode catalyst. We attribute the high ORR activity and fuel cell performance to a combined effect of the high active-site density of the Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) catalyst (Fig.
1d
) and the high accessibility of active sites. The high porosity of the Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) itself (particularly, the abundance of >2 nm meso- and/or macropores (Fig.
2c
)) and the catalyst layer (abundance of >50 nm macropores (Supplementary Fig.
15
)) enhance the mass transfer, and the uniform Nafion ionomer distribution within the catalyst layer (Supplementary Fig.
15
) benefits ion transfer and the formation of triple-phase boundaries

.
Catalyst durability
The durability of the Co(mIm)–C(1.0) catalyst was first studied using RRDE and compared with that of the similarly synthesized Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) catalyst. After 10,000 potential cycles from 0.6 to 1.0 V versus RHE in an O

electrolyte, we observed only an 11% current density degradation at 0.85 V for Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) (Fig.
4a
), over four times less than that for Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0), which degraded by 47% (Fig.
4b
). Further, Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) exhibited a much smaller loss in
E
1/2
(8 mV), 20 mV lower than that for Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) (28 mV loss in
E

). The increases in capacitive current (Fig.

) for Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) after the durability tests are much lower than those for Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) (Fig.

4c
), which indicates a much lower oxidation and degradation of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0). Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) also has a higher durability than that of Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) when subjected to a 100 hour hold at a potential of 0.7 V in an O

To evaluate catalyst durability in the more practical fuel cell environment, we held the voltage of fuel cells that contained the two cathode catalysts, Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) and Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0), at 0.7 V for 100 hours with 1.0 bar H
2
on the anode and 1.0 bar air on the cathode. During the tests, the fuel cell current density at 0.7 V degraded by 20.5% for the fuel cell with the Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) cathode versus 46.8% for the fuel cell with the Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) cathode (Fig.
4d
and Supplementary Fig.
17a,b
). Given the similar properties of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) and Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0), that is, the same metal–nitrogen coordination, same atomic dispersion and same carbon structure (Supplementary Fig.
10
–
12
), we attribute the enhanced durability of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) to the lower activity of Co ions for the radical-generating Fenton reactions
56
,
57
and to the intrinsic stability of the CoN
4
sites. However, a more in-depth study is needed as to the mechanism of M–N–C catalyst degradation and why Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) is more durable. In the case of PGM-free M–N–C catalyst, there are very limited studies on degradation mechanisms, most of which focused on Fe–N–C (refs
20
,
21
,
22
,
27
,
28
,

59
) and revealed the main degradation mechanisms, which included catalyst oxidation by radicals and active site demetallation. Experiments and theoretical simulations to elucidate and compare the degradation mechanisms for the Co–N–C and Fe–N–C catalysts of this study are described in the next section.

, rather than by electrochemical oxidation, has been proposed as one of the key mechanisms of PGM-free M–N–C catalyst degradation during normal fuel cell operations. Here we first studied the degradation of the Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) catalyst with a focus on chemical oxidation.
Key experiments to determine the likely mechanism of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) degradation involved
in situ
determination of CO
2
in an operating PEM fuel cell (Supplementary Fig.
18
). CO
2
emission was found to increase abruptly after the gas feed to the cathode was switched from N
2
to O
2
at a cell voltage of 0.3 V (Fig.
5a
). CO
2
emission slightly decreased when the cell voltage was switched from 0.3 to 0.8 V, whereas CO
2
emission increased when the cell voltage was switched back to 0.3 V. CO
2
emission decreased substantially after the gas feed to the cathode was switched back from O
2
to N
2
. These results confirm that the majority of CO
2
was from the chemical oxidation of catalysts and not from the electrochemical oxidation, which is electrode potential dependent. The chemical oxidation is most probably caused by H
2
O
2
-derived radicals as it happens during oxygen reduction. We propose that the carbon oxidation of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) follows two main pathways: pathway I is the direct oxidation to CO
2
, mainly of very unstable carbon (and surface functional groups), most of which occurs in the early stages of the fuel cell operations, or by uncontrolled transient O
2
in and/or out and fuel cell voltage change, as can be seen from the transient CO
2
spikes (Fig.
5a,c
); and pathway II is the oxidation to surface functional groups (reversible oxidation) and further to CO
2
(irreversible oxidation), which lasts until the end of the catalyst’s life. During the experiment, CO
2
emission from pathway I decreases rapidly, whereas CO
2
emission from pathway II maintains a downward trend after the transient is observed. Strong evidence is given in the literature for the reversible surface oxidation of carbon
20
,
59
. We also observed reversible surface oxidation, which includes the partial recovery of the ORR activity of the catalyst on catalyst renewal (Supplementary Fig.
16d
) and the increase in capacitive current of the catalyst in cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in Ar-saturated 0.5 M H

Therefore, we applied a voltage-step test protocol modified from a protocol presented previously
27
to maximize the effect of H
2
O
2
and the related radicals on the M–N–C ORR catalyst’s durability. In brief, the current density at a cell voltage of 0.85 V for the 1.0 bar H
2
/O
2
PEM fuel cell was measured for 5 minutes followed by holding the fuel cell at various cell voltages (0.40, 0.65 or 0.80 V) for 55 minutes, followed by measuring the fuel cell current density at 0.85 V for 5 minutes. The cycle was then repeated. Our durability tests showed a faster degradation at lower cell voltages (Supplementary Fig.
19
). This can be explained in terms of the radical attack of the catalyst, which is more severe at higher ORR current densities, that is, lower cell voltages, which are amenable to producing higher amounts of H
2
O
2
and thus radicals
27
. Besides the formation of CO
2
, the oxidation of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) by radicals may lead to the formation of surface-functionalized groups, which have been shown to decrease the turnover frequency of active sites and thus degrade the catalyst
58
.
We then performed durability tests in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) and Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) using the above voltage-step test protocol with H
2
/O
2
atmospheres on the anode/cathode. The MEA with the Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) cathode catalyst was much more durable than that with the Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) cathode catalyst (Supplementary Fig.
17c,d
), as can be seen from the percentage of current density retention at 0.85 V after the 50 hour test (Fig.
5b
). The Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) MEA retained 50% of its initial current density, whereas the Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) MEA retained <5%. The enhanced durability of the Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) MEA is probably due in part to the alleviated oxidation by radicals (probably due to the lower activity of Co ions for the Fenton reactions
56
,
57
), as evidenced by the much lower cathode CO
2
emissions in the MEA studies observed for the Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) cathode than for the Fe(mIm)-NC(1.0) cathode (Fig.
5c
). The results from acidic H

treatment, an experiment presented in Choi et al.
20
and Bae et al.
59
to study the radical-induced degradation of M–N–C catalysts, confirm the much less radical attack of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) than that of Fe(mIm)-NC(1.0) (Supplementary Fig.
20
).
The other major degradation mechanism proposed in the literature is demetallation
22
,
60
. To quantify the demetallation of Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) and Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) and to determine its dependence on experimental conditions, the two catalysts were electrochemically cycled between 0.6 and 1.0 V (versus RHE) in Ar- and O
2
-purged 0.5 M H
2
SO
4
and the amount of metal leached from the catalysts was determined using ICP-OES. Only a small amount of metal leached out from both catalysts when cycled in Ar-purged 0.5 M H
2
SO
4
at 25 °C (Fig.
5d
), which indicates that the Co and Fe atoms in the catalysts are relatively stable under such conditions. However, the amount of leached Fe increased to 6.5 wt% when cycled in O
2
-purged 0.5 M H
2
SO
4
at 25 °C, whereas the change in the amount of Co leached was minimal. Cycling in O
2
-purged 0.5 M H
2
SO
4
at an elevated temperature of 80 °C caused a significantly increased metal leaching for both the catalysts. However, much less Co was leached than Fe (7.3 wt% Co versus 40 wt% Fe). This indicates that O
2
promotes Fe–N–C demetallation at 25 °C, but does not substantially enhance Co–N–C demetallation; the extent of demetallation is much more severe for Fe–N–C than for Co–N–C at 80 °C, the typical PEM fuel cell temperature, and therefore Co–N–C is more resistant to demetallation than Fe–N–C under such conditions. The RRDE ORR activity tests before and after the demetallation experiments indicated that the activity decay of Co–N–C was much lower than that of Fe–N–C (Fig.
5e
and Supplementary Fig.
21
).
To understand the observed trend of the stability of Co–N–C and Fe–N–C, we performed first principles DFT calculations to predict the tendency for demetallation of MN
4
active sites. Our experimental results from XAS, Mössbauer spectroscopy and pore distribution analysis suggested that the primary existence of porphyrin-like MN
4
C
12
(M = Fe or Co) moieties as the ORR active sites in our catalysts; hence, we focused on modelling the demetallation process of such a porphyrin-like MN
4
C
12
site (Fig.
5f
and Supplementary Figs.
22
and
23
). We also conducted the same modelling study on alternative in-plane CoN
4
C
10
(Supplementary Fig.
24
) and pyridinic-N-based MN
2+2
C
4+4
sites
30
(Supplementary Fig.
25
). The proposed leaching mechanism of M from those MN
4
sites shows that the M atom moves away from the N
4
-coordinated state to the carbon surface, adsorbing on two N atoms, whereas the other two N atoms form N–H bonds with H from the acidic environment. Note that at a high electrode potential (
U
), for example, 0.9 V >
U
> 0.5 V, FeN
4
sites were predicted to be covered by OH* under thermodynamic conditions, but there are no adsorbates on CoN
4
sites in this potential range
61
. Thus, we calculated the Gibbs free energy change (Δ
G
) for the demetallation of FeN
4
and CoN
4
sites without adsorbates and with O
2
adsorbates, as well as the case with O
2
–OH* co-adsorbates only for FeN
4
(Supplementary Figs.
22
–
25
). We found that all the MN
4
sites without adsorbates require more than 3.0 eV Δ
G
for demetallation, which implies that they are stable under such conditions, consistent with our demetallation experiment results in a deaerated environment. More importantly, our DFT results further show that adding an O
2
onto those sites significantly decreases the Δ
G
values for demetallation (Supplementary Table
7
), which indicates that, from the thermodynamic point of view, O
2
promotes the demetallation. In particular, we predict that the free energy barrier required for demetallation from porphyrin-like FeN
4
C
12
sites with O
2
–OH* co-adsorbates becomes negative (Fig.
5g
), which shows a severe demetallation tendency for Fe–N–C. As OH* does not have a similar affinity to porphyrin-like CoN
4
C
12
sites, Co–N–C is predicted to better resist demetallation than Fe–N–C. Note that we only calculated the Δ
G
for metal leaching, but the rate of metal leaching is also related to the kinetic activation energy for the metal leaching, which is often larger than or at least no less than Δ
G
. This explains why, in our demetallation experiments, O
2
does not have a substantial impact on Co–N–C demetallation at 25 °C, as Δ
G
for all the CoN
x
demetallation is much higher than 0 eV. Furthermore, our DFT results reveal that the stability of porphyrin-like CoN
4
C
12
against metal leaching is related to the Co–N bond length. With a decrease in Co–N bond length from 2.01 to 1.94 Å (Supplementary Figs.
21
and
22
), it was found that Δ
G
for metal leaching from O
2
adsorbed porphyrin-like CoN
4
C
12
increases from 0.55 eV to 0.84 eV (Fig.
5f
, O
2
environment). Note that the DFT optimized Co–N bond length is 2.01 Å for the porphyrin-like CoN
4
C
12
sites, whereas our EXAFS analysis shows that the Co–N bond length is 1.94 Å in our catalyst. The shortened Co–N bond length is probably the origin of the remarkable stability with an excellent tolerance against demetallation during the ORR for the Co–N–C catalyst.
Conclusions
A high-performance atomically dispersed Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) catalyst was synthesized via the immobilization and fencing of CoN
4
moieties in ZIF-8 micropores with an encapsulation–ligand exchange approach. This approach significantly increases the density of CoN

PEM fuel cell tests, the highest activities reported for non-Fe M–N–C ORR catalysts. We applied extensive physical characterization to the Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) catalyst and verified that our approach results in predominantly atomically dispersed Co sites. The ORR active sites, most probably porphyrin-like CoN
4
C
12
active sites, in Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) are predominantly located inside the carbon micropores. More importantly, our Co(mIm)–NC(1.0) catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced durability compared with that of the similarly synthesized Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) catalyst. Our extensive degradation mechanism studies indicate that chemical oxidation of the catalyst by radicals and active site demetallation (particularly in the presence of O
2
and at elevated temperatures) are primarily responsible for M–N–C catalyst degradation. Both degradation paths appear to be alleviated for the Co–N–C catalyst relative to those for the similarly synthesized Fe–N–C catalyst. This approach to forming a high density of single-atom CoN
x
active sites provides a promising way to develop highly active and durable Fe-free, PGM-free ORR catalysts for PEM fuel cells.

Material characterization
The crystal phases in catalyst samples were studied using powder XRD on a Rigaku SmartLab SE Bragg-Brentano diffractometer using a Cu source (
λ

XPS was carried out using a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD XPS system equipped with a hemispherical energy analyser and a monochromatic Al Kα source operated at 15 keV and 150 W. The pass energy was fixed at 40 eV for all of the high-resolution scans. All the peaks were adjusted using the C 1
s
peak at 285.0 eV as the reference. ICP-OES analysis was performed with a Perkin Elmer Optima 7300 DV ICP/OES instrument equipped with a Meinhard nebulizer and cyclonic spray chamber. Surface area and pore distribution analysis of the samples were measured by N
2
adsorption at 77 K with an Autosorb iQ Gas Sorption System (Quantachrome Instruments, a brand of Anton Paar). The samples were degassed under vacuum at 100 °C (10 h) before the adsorption measurements. The surface area was determined using the seven-point Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. The non-local DFT method was used for micropore distribution determination. BF-STEM and HAADF-STEM images were captured in a Nion UltraSTEM (U100) operated at 60 keV and equipped with a Gatan Enfina electron energy loss spectrometer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Co and Fe K-edge XANES and EXAFS experiments were carried out at beamline 10-ID (Materials Research Collaborative Access Team, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory). Data reduction, data analysis and EXAFS fitting were performed with the Athena, Artemis and IFEFFIT software packages

Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical testing was carried out in a three-electrode set-up controlled by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D, CH Instruments).

PEM fuel cell testing
The catalyst (0.1 g) was suspended in 6 ml of methanol solvent. The desired amount of Nafion suspension in the alcohols was added and the mixture was sonicated for 10 min before use. The MEA was fabricated by spraying the catalyst–ionomer ink onto a Nafion HP membrane, with the resulting active area of 5.0 cm
