Abstract
Selective conversion of syngas to value-added higher alcohols (containing two or more carbon atoms), particularly to a specific alcohol, is of great interest but remains challenging. Here we show that atomically intimate assembly of FeO
x
-Rh-ZrO
2
dual interfaces by selectively architecting highly dispersed FeO
x
on ultrafine raft-like Rh clusters supported on tetragonal zirconia enables highly efficient tandem conversion of syngas to ethanol. The ethanol selectivity in oxygenates reached ~90% at CO conversion up to 51%, along with a markedly high space-time yield of ethanol of 668.2 mg g
cat
−1
h
−1
. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that Rh-ZrO
2
interface promotes dissociative CO activation into CH
x
through a formate pathway, while the adjacent Rh-FeO
x
interface accelerates subsequent C–C coupling via nondissociative CO insertion. Consequently, these dual interfaces in atomic-scale proximity with complementary functionalities synergistically boost the exclusive formation of ethanol with exceptional productivity in a tandem manner.

Main
Higher alcohols (containing two or more carbon atoms, C
2+
) are important feedstocks for fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fuel additives. Their production currently relies on sugar fermentation and/or the hydration of petroleum-derived alkenes
1
. With the growing global demand, the synthesis of C
2+
alcohols from alternative carbon resources such as coal, natural gas and biomass via syngas (a mixture of CO and H
2
) has attracted long-standing interest
1
,
2
,
3
. This route requires multiple elementary reaction steps, including dissociative CO activation to form alkyl species (CH
x
*, where * denotes surface species), subsequent C–C coupling of CH
x
* to grow carbon chains, nondissociative CO insertion and stepwise hydrogenations
2
,
3
,
4
, leading to a broad product distribution, where complex oxygenate mixtures of various alcohols, aldehydes, esters and acids are generally produced. Owing to small differences in their boiling temperatures
2
,
4
,
5
, subsequent product separation and purification can be highly energy demanding. The delicate control of the above competing elementary reactions to exclusively produce a specific C
2+
oxygenate, especially at high CO conversions, is highly desirable for practical applications but remains extremely challenging.
Ethanol (EtOH) is an essential commodity chemical with a global demand of 100 billion gallons annually
2
,
4
,
6
. Direct conversion of syngas to EtOH requires only one step of C–C coupling, thus holding great potential for high selectivity. Incorporating transition metal or alkali metal promoters into documented Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS)

is an effective approach to improve EtOH selectivity, while the highest EtOH selectivity in total oxygenates achieved so far was approximately 53% at a CO conversion of 10%, to the best of our knowledge (Supplementary Table
1
). Alkali-promoted Mo-based catalysts have also been explored
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
and achieved a markable EtOH selectivity of ~60% in oxygenates at a CO conversion of ~8% (ref.
15
). In comparison, Rh catalysts with alkali promoters and/or Rh-M(O

. Unfortunately, high EtOH selectivity (>80%) has generally been achieved at low conversions (<5%) even with multiple promoters involved
2
,
4
(Supplementary Table
2
). Tandem catalysis using multiple catalysts is another effective approach for achieving high selectivity
5
,
30
,
31
,
32
. For instance, Wang et al.
5
reported a remarkably high EtOH selectivity of 95% in oxygenates at a CO conversion of 5.7% over tri-component tandem catalysts of K
+
-modified ZnO−ZrO
2
, H-MOR zeolite and Pt−Sn/SiC
5
. Consequently, there is an urgent need to overcome the severe activity–selectivity trade-off
3
,
17
, thus largely promoting the productivity of a specific C
2+
alcohol with high selectivity.
In this Article, we report that the precise assembly of Rh-ZrO
2
and Rh-FeO
x
interfaces in atomic-scale proximity on tetragonal zirconia (
t
-ZrO
2
) enables efficient tandem conversion of syngas to EtOH. The resulting dual-interface catalyst broke the activity–selectivity trade-off and achieved a high EtOH selectivity of up to 90% in oxygenates at an appreciable CO conversion of 51% as well as a high EtOH space-time yield (STY) of 668.2 mg g
cat
−1
h
−1
, greatly outperforming those reported in the literature. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations revealed the atomic structure of the Rh-FeO
x
interfaces and further elucidated the molecular mechanism of tandem catalysis at the intimate FeO

dual interfaces.
Results
Synthesis and catalytic performance
ZrO
2
has been widely utilized in C1 chemistry owing to its unique surface basicity and hydrophilicity
24
,
33
,
34
. Here a
t
-ZrO
2
support (90 m
2
g
−1
) was first synthesized using the sol–gel method
35
(Supplementary Fig.
1
). A Rh/ZrO
2
catalyst was then prepared using the incipient-wetness impregnation (IWI) method with a Rh content of 3.3 wt%. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping revealed that Rh was highly dispersed on
t
-ZrO
2
with a cluster size of 1.1 ± 0.3 nm, along with a small fraction of isolated Rh atoms (Supplementary Figs.
2
and
3
). Compared with isolated Rh atoms, the slightly stronger intensity observed in the Rh clusters suggested a two-dimensional raft-like structure comprising approximately one or two atomic layers
36
,
37
, since the intensity in
Z
-contrast STEM images is approximately proportional to the number of atomic layers
38
. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements revealed that surface defects serve as nucleation sites for Rh according to the disappearance of oxygen vacancies (V
O
,
g
= 2.002) after Rh loading
39
,
40
(Supplementary Fig.
4
).
Next, FeO
x
was selectively deposited on Rh clusters using atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 150 °C to fabricate the FeO
x
-Rh-ZrO
2
dual-interface catalysts
41
(Fig.
1
). To minimize the blockage of Rh-ZrO
2
interfaces by FeO
x
ALD, the Rh/ZrO
2
catalyst was first exposed to ethylene glycol (EG) to passivate the potential ALD nucleation sites on ZrO
2
, that is, hydroxyls, by forming stable alkoxides while leaving Rh sites intact
42
(Supplementary Fig.
5
); FeO
x
ALD was then performed on EG-pretreated Rh/ZrO
2
for different numbers of cycles to tune the coverage of FeO
x
on Rh clusters (
x
Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
, where
x
represents the number of ALD cycles); finally, EG was completely removed to re-expose the Rh-ZrO
2
interfaces (Supplementary Fig.
6a
). Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis unambiguously verified the selective deposition of FeO
x
on Rh but not on ZrO
2
(Supplementary Fig.
6b
and Supplementary Table
3
). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and TEM showed that there was no aggregation of Rh clusters during FeO
x
ALD (Supplementary Figs.
7
and
8
). For comparison, nonselective FeO
x
ALD was also performed on unpretreated Rh/ZrO
2
(6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-ns), which caused the partial blockage of Rh-ZrO
2
interfaces (Supplementary Figs.
6b
and
9
). Rh/SiO
2
and Rh/Fe
2
O
3
catalysts with identical Rh contents were also synthesized using the same IWI method for comparison, in which the Rh particle sizes were 3.1 ± 0.8 nm and 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, respectively (Supplementary Figs.
10
and
11
).

The catalytic performance of these Rh catalysts was evaluated in syngas conversions under identical conditions (260 °C, 2.5 MPa and H
2
:CO = 3:1). As shown in Fig.
2a
, Rh/SiO
2
exhibited a low CO conversion of only 2.1% and an EtOH STY of 3.8 mg g

−1
. By contrast, Rh/ZrO
2
showed a much greater CO conversion of 14.6% and an EtOH STY of 46.1 mg g
cat
−1
h
−1
, while the EtOH selectivity was still limited about 54.6% in oxygenates. Clearly, Rh-ZrO
2
interface is much more active than Rh-SiO
2
interface and the Rh metal itself in CO activation
43
. In comparison, Rh/Fe
2
O
3
exhibited a much greater STY of 112.6 mg g
cat
−1
h
−1
along with a comparable CO conversion of 16.3% and a higher EtOH selectivity of 66.0% in oxygenates, suggesting that Rh-FeO
x
interface is active and more selective for C–C coupling to form EtOH, in line with the literature
4
,
44
,
45
,
46
,
47
. However, all these three catalysts inevitably produced a considerable amount of methanol with a selectivity of 25–64% in oxygenates (Fig.
2a
and Supplementary Table
4
).

dual interfaces exhibited drastic promotion of catalytic performance. Therein, CO conversion exhibited a volcano-like trend with the FeO

coverage, reaching a maximum of 50.9% and an EtOH selectivity of 88.1% in oxygenates (32.6% in all products) on 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
. This greatly enhanced the EtOH STY to 368.6 mg g

, which was approximately 97, 8 and 3 times greater than that of Rh/SiO

) of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-ns with partially blocked Rh-ZrO
2
interfaces (Fig.
2a
, Supplementary Fig.
12
and Supplementary Table
4
). Kinetic measurements further revealed a substantially lower apparent activation energy of ~87.2 kJ mol

for 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
than those of Rh/ZrO
2
(~105.2 kJ mol
−1

(107.5 kJ mol

(134.8 kJ mol

) (Fig.

), as well as those reported in the literature (99–158 kJ mol
−1
)
43
, verifying the higher intrinsic activity. Impressively, the methanol selectivity of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
was only 7.8% in oxygenates (Supplementary Table
4
).
Notably, physical mixing Rh/ZrO
2
and Rh/Fe
2
O

(denoted as Rh/ZrO

) or depositing FeO
x
on a Rh nanoparticle (NP) catalyst (6Fe-Rh
NPs
/ZrO
2
) (Supplementary Fig.
13
) all yielded low EtOH STYs of only 81.5–102.2 mg g
cat
−1
h
−1
(Supplementary Table
4
). Coating Rh/Fe

with FeO

(denoted as 6Fe-Rh/Fe

) or coating Rh/ZrO
2
with ZrO
2
(denoted as 3Zr-Rh/ZrO
2
) to create additional Rh-FeO
x
or Rh-ZrO
2
interfaces did not appreciably promote the performance either (Supplementary Figs.
14
and
15
). Therefore, the assembly of dual interfaces with complementary functionalities in atomic-scale intimacy is of essential importance for dual-interface synergies.
We further varied the reaction pressure from 1 MPa to 4 MPa and the H
2
/CO ratio from 1 to 3 for the optimized 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
catalyst. We found that the EtOH selectivity had very trivial changes (Supplementary Fig.
16
). Decreasing the weight-hourly space velocity (WHSV) from 60,000 ml g
cat
−1
h
−1
to 9,000 ml g
cat
−1
h
−1
, the EtOH selectivity surprisingly maintained above 88% in oxygenates even at a CO conversion of 50.9% (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Table
5
), sharply distinct from the rapid decline in EtOH selectivity on other three catalysts. The breakage of the activity–selectivity trade-off by dual-interface synergy boosted the single-pass yield of EtOH up to 16.6%, outperforming Rh-based catalysts reported so far (Supplementary Fig.
17
and Supplementary Table
2
). Remarkably, under mild reaction conditions (Supplementary Tables
1
and
2
), the 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
catalyst achieved a record high EtOH formation rate of 668.2 mg g
cat
−1
h
−1
at a CO conversion of 31.5% along with a selectivity of ~90% in oxygenates (35.8% in all products), far superior to that of state-of-the-art catalysts reported so far
2
,
4
,
6
,
48
(Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Fig.
18
). More importantly, 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
also exhibited excellent stability for at least 200 h without any Rh aggregation (Supplementary Fig.
19
) or visible decline in either activity or selectivity (Fig.
2e
), demonstrating its great potential for practical applications.
Structural characterization
STEM-EDS elemental mapping showed that the Fe and Rh signals in 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
strongly overlapped with each other, confirming the selective deposition of FeO
x
on the Rh clusters (Fig.
3a–d
). FeO
x
-coated Rh clusters showed an average diameter of 1.2 ± 0.2 nm (Fig.
3e
and Supplementary Fig.
20
) and their intensities were again only slightly stronger than those of the isolated Rh atoms (Fig.
3f–h
), suggesting that the raft-like structure was preserved after FeO
x
decoration. Such highly dispersed, atomically thick features of FeO
x
-Rh rafts on ZrO
2
not only allow maximization of Rh atom utilization but also make Rh-ZrO
2
and Rh-FeO
x
interfaces in atomic-scale proximity.

Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO chemisorption on Rh/ZrO
2
showed that there were two dominant peaks at ~2,086 cm
−1
and ~2,010 cm
−1
and two weaker peaks at 2,066 cm
−1
and ~1,846 cm

35
,
49
, as well as linear- and bridge-bounded CO on larger Rh ensembles
20
,
21
,
35
,
49
. The much stronger intensities of geminal dicarbonyl CO peaks suggest the high dispersion of Rh species, consistent with the STEM observations (Supplementary Fig.
2
). For FeO
x
-coated Rh/ZrO
2
catalysts, the intensities of linear- and bridge-bonded CO peaks attenuated more rapidly than those of geminal dicarbonyl CO peaks as FeO
x
ALD cycles increased and completely vanished on 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
(Fig.
3i
and Supplementary Fig.
21
), demonstrating the tuning of Rh-FeO
x
interfaces.
To determine the structure of Rh-FeO
x
interfaces under realistic reaction conditions, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were further conducted. At the Fe K-edge, after H
2
reduction of the pristine sample (6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-O) at 400 °C (6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-R), the pre-edge peak at 7,115 eV, corresponding to a 1

d
transition of Fe
3+
oxide
41
, disappeared along with a downshift of absorption edge even slightly lower than that of FeO reference (Fig.
4a
and Supplementary Fig.
22
). Switching to syngas at 260 °C (6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-S), the pre-edge peak reappeared and the absorption edge resembled that of FeO, indicating slight re-oxidation of Fe
δ
+
(0 <
δ
< 2) to Fe
2+
. At the Rh K-edge, the absorption edges of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-R and 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-S both resembled that of Rh foil, suggesting that the majority of Rh was in a Rh
0
metallic state under reaction conditions (Fig.

).

The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra showed that compared with that of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-O (Supplementary Fig.
23
), the Fe–O peak of 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-R and 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-S both decreased remarkably (Fig.
4c
), with a coordination number (CN) of 1.7–2.3 (Supplementary Fig.
24
and Supplementary Table
6
). The new peak at 2.32 Å is attributed to Fe–Rh coordination according to wavelet-transform (WT) analysis (Supplementary Fig.
25
and Supplementary Table
6
). Meanwhile, the absence of Fe–Fe coordination peak (>2.5 Å) implies that the majority of Fe oxo were atomically dispersed under reaction conditions. At the Rh K-edge, 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-R and 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-S both showed a broad Rh–Rh coordination peak at 2.39 Å with a CN of ~6.5 (Fig.

(6.4–6.8) (Supplementary Figs.

), which agrees well with the ‘raft-like’ structure of Rh clusters since the Rh–Rh CN is expected to be greater than 8 for three-dimensional NPs

and further supported by quasi in situ XPS measurements (Supplementary Fig.

Spectroscopic insights into syngas conversion
In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to obtain insights into the dual-interface synergy. After introducing CO at 260 °C, we observed two CO peaks at 2,055 cm
−1
and 1,935 cm
−1
on Rh/SiO
2
(refs.
20
,
43
) (Fig.
5a
). By contrast, strong formate peaks (HCOO*, 2,966 cm

, 2,874 cm
−1
, 1,568 cm
−1
and 1,384 cm
−1
)

were observed on

(Fig.

)
35
,

. Interestingly, these formate peaks became much stronger on Rh/ZrO
2
and 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
along with the CO peaks at 2,044 cm
−1
and 1,830 cm
−1
, suggesting that formate species are more favourably formed at Rh-ZrO
2
interfaces.

Switching CO to H
2
, the CO peaks on Rh/SiO
2
decreased slowly. Neither methoxy (a key intermediate for methanol, CH
3
O*) nor methane was observed (Supplementary Fig.
32
). For Rh/ZrO
2
, the CO peaks decreased rapidly in H
2
, while the peaks of HCOO*, CH
3
O* (2,925 cm
−1
) and gaseous CH
4
(3,015 cm
−1
) all slightly increased at the early stage and then decreased gradually with time (Fig.
5b,d
). Clearly, CO hydrogenation is difficult at either Rh-SiO
2
interfaces or on Rh metal surfaces but readily occurs at Rh-ZrO
2
interfaces via the formate pathway (no reaction on bare
t
-ZrO
2
, seen in Supplementary Fig.
31
), in line with the observed much higher catalytic activity of Rh/ZrO
2
than Rh/SiO
2
(Fig.
2a
).
On 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
, switching CO to H
2
led to a much quicker decrease in HCOO* (Fig.
5c,d
). Meanwhile, CH
3
O* decreased instantly without any accumulation at the early stage, in sharp contrast to that of Rh/ZrO
2
(Fig.
5d
). Given the competition between HCOO* hydrogenation to CH
3
O* or to CH
x
* at Rh-ZrO
2
interface, such suppression of CH
3
O* formation implies a shift of reaction path to HCOO* → CH
x
*. Such a shift is likely attributed to an accelerated consumption of CH
x
* via C–C coupling with adsorbed CO* to form EtOH at the adjacent Rh-Fe
1
O
2
interfaces, and was further supported by a faster consumption of CO* on 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
than on Rh/ZrO
2
(Supplementary Fig.
33
). In addition, after switching to H
2
, hydroxyl groups were recovered on both Rh/ZrO
2
and 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
(Fig.
5b,c
), closing the catalytic cycle.
Theoretical insights
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further conducted to gain deeper insights into dual-interface synergy. According to the presence of hydroxyls and V
O
on
t
-ZrO
2
(Fig.
5a
and Supplementary Fig.
4
), the most stable (101) plane of
t
-ZrO
2
with hydroxyl groups and V
O
was adopted as a support to construct the dual-interface model
35
,
53
,
54
,
55
. We found that Rh
20
clusters tend to bind strongly to defective
t
-ZrO
2
(101) by forming a flat structure with a thickness of two atomic layers and a diameter of 1.18 nm according to genetic algorithms
56
,
57
(Supplementary Figs.
34
and
35
), and enhanced charge transfers at the interface based on Bader charge analysis (Supplementary Fig.
36
), which agrees excellently with the experimental results (Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Figs.
2
,
4
and
30
). After testing a single Fe atom with various possible O, OH and CO ligands on the Rh
20
cluster under reaction conditions, we found that the isolated Fe
1
O
x
motif preferentially binds at the Rh bridge sites of the Rh
20
cluster, with the Fe atom coordinated to two Rh atoms and two tilted CO molecules (denoted as Fe

t

(101)) (Fig.

and Supplementary Figs.

and

). The two Fe–Rh bonds and two Fe–O bonds have average bond lengths of approximately 2.58 Å and 1.99 Å, respectively, which all align excellently with the XAFS results (Supplementary Tables
6
and
7
). As a reference, we also constructed a Rh(211) surface to model the Rh/SiO
2
catalyst (Supplementary Fig.

).

CO activation is commonly considered as the rate-determining step in this reaction on Rh catalysts
43
,
58
,
59
. On Rh(211), we found that hydrogen-assisted CO activation via the HCO* intermediate is more favourable than direct dissociation (Supplementary Figs.
40
and
41
and Supplementary Tables
9
and
10
), but still notably endothermic by 0.77 eV and with a high barrier of 1.80 eV (Fig.
6b
). At Rh-FeO
x
interfaces, hydrogen-assisted CO activation is considerably facilitated, with a reduced reaction energy of 0.08 eV and a barrier of 1.52 eV (Fig.
6b
, Supplementary Figs.
42
and
43
, and Supplementary Table
10
), owing to the enhanced adsorption of HCO* and O* intermediates (Supplementary Fig.
44
and Supplementary Table
9
). On
t
-ZrO
2
(101), direct and hydrogen-assisted dissociation are both thermodynamically unfavourable (Supplementary Table
10
). By contrast, we found that strongly adsorbed CO* (
E
CO
= −1.92 eV) can readily react with OH* to form COOH* and then transform to HCOO* with a moderate barrier of 1.19 eV (Fig.
6c
). Next, HCOO* exothermically migrates to the Rh-ZrO
2
interface owing to the increased adsorption energy from −1.91 eV to −3.47 eV, in line with the DRIFTS observation of much stronger HCOO* intensities on Rh/ZrO
2
and 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
than on bare
t
-ZrO
2
(Fig.
5a
). Next, HCOO* species dissociate sequentially to HCO* and then CH* at the Rh-ZrO
2
interface with a barrier of 1.33 eV at most (Fig.
6c
, Supplementary Figs.
47
and
48
and Supplementary Table
11
). Therefore, compared with Rh metal and Rh-FeO
x
interface, Rh-ZrO
2
interfaces are more active for converting of CO to CH
x
*, where the hydroxylated
t
-ZrO
2
support serves as a HCOO* reservoir to boost the reaction.
Regarding C–C coupling, CO* insertion into CH
3
* is found to be the most favourable path for Rh(211), Rh-FeO
x
and Rh-ZrO
2
interface (Supplementary Figs.
49
–
55
and Supplementary Tables
12
and
13
). Nonetheless, on Rh(211), CO* insertion into CH
3
* to form CH
3
CO*, a key intermediate for EtOH, is much less favourable than direct CH
3
* hydrogenation to methane (Fig.
6d
, Supplementary Figs.
49
–
52
and Supplementary Tables
12
and
13
), which makes methane to be the preferential product over Rh metal surfaces as observed on Rh/SiO
2
(Supplementary Table
4
). However, at Rh-FeO
x
interfaces, the adsorption of CH
3
CO* is much stronger than that of CH
3
CO* on Rh(211) owing to the enhanced orbital hybridization and considerable charge transfer from Fe to CH
3
CO* (Fig.
6e
and Supplementary Table
9
). Consequently, CO insertion into CH
3
* to form CH
3
CO* becomes exothermic by −0.23 eV at Rh-FeO
x
interfaces, along with a much low barrier of 0.80 eV, which is energetically more favourable than the hydrogenation of CH
3
* (endothermic by 0.10 eV; Fig.
6d
, Supplementary Figs.
49
,
53
and
54
, and Supplementary Tables
12
and
13
). At Rh-ZrO
2
(101) interfaces, CO* insertion into CH
3
* to form CH
3
CO* is found to be less feasible (Fig.
6d
, Supplementary Figs.
49
and
55
and Supplementary Tables
12
and
13
). In brief, among these three types of reaction sites, Rh-FeO
x
interfaces appear to be the most favourable sites for C–C coupling, which agree excellently with the observation of markedly higher EtOH selectivity of Rh/Fe
2
O
3
and
x
Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
as well as the suppression of CH
3
O* formation in the DRIFTS results (Figs.
2a
and
5d
).
To achieve high EtOH yields in syngas conversion, it is crucial to ensure the balance of the two key elementary reaction steps: CO activation to CH
x
* and subsequent C–C coupling via the insertion of CO* into CH
x
*, both with high efficiency. As demonstrated by our calculations, the dual-interface synergy enables a tandem reaction process, that is, the Rh-ZrO
2
interface can efficiently activate CO* to form CH
x
* via the formate path with the ZrO
2
support as a formate reservoir; then, the formed CH
x
* readily couples with another CO* molecule to form CH
3
CO* intermediates at the adjacent Rh-FeO
x
interfaces, thus synergistically boosting exclusive EtOH formation (Fig.
6f
). Therein, the variation of the FeO
x
coverage (Supplementary Fig.
21
) allows balancing the kinetics of these two key elementary reactions (Supplementary Fig.
12
), thus achieving a remarkably high EtOH productivity.
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated that the precise decoration of atomically dispersed FeO
x
onto ultrafine Rh rafts in Rh/ZrO2 to assemble dual FeO
x
-Rh-ZrO
2
interfaces intimately enables efficient tandem conversion of syngas to EtOH by achieving an EtOH selectivity of ~90% in total oxygenates at an appreciable conversion of 51%, along with a remarkably high STY of 668.2 mg g
cat
−1
h
−1
. In situ spectroscopic characterization and DFT calculations reveal that Rh-ZrO
2
and Rh-FeO
x
interfaces play complementary roles in the reaction by facilitating CO activation and C–C coupling, respectively. The delicate assembly of these two interfaces in atomic-scale proximity finely tailors the balance of the kinetics of the two key elementary reactions, thus synergistically boosting the exclusive EtOH formation in a tandem manner. These findings point out a new way to rationally design highly active and selective metal catalysts for complex reactions by assembling dual/multiple metal–oxide interfaces with specific functions in atomic-scale proximity.

The tetragonal zirconia support was synthesized via a sol–gel method. Typically, 17.7 g of zirconium
n

n

The resulting gel was filtered and dried at 100 °C for 10 h. Finally, the dried sample was calcined at 400 °C in air for 4 h to obtain the ZrO

in Ar to obtain the Rh

catalyst was dispersed into EG and stirred for 12 h at 30 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged and dried at 70 °C overnight to obtain the modified catalyst.

Morphology and composition
TEM and HR-TEM measurements were performed on a JEM-2100F instrument operated at 200 kV to characterize the morphology of these samples. Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM measurements were performed on an instrument at 200 kV (JEM-ARM200F, University of Science and Technology of China). Elemental mapping via EDS was performed on the same equipment. The Rh and Fe contents of the various catalysts were analysed via ICP-AES (PerkinElmer Optima 7300 DV). Powder XRD measurements were carried out on a Philips X’Pert Pro Super diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 50 mA. The patterns were measured in the 2
θ
range from 20° to 80°. EPR spectroscopy was performed on a JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer operated at an X-band frequency of 9.1 GHz, a microwave power of 1 mW and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA550 instrument (TA Instruments) equipped with an evolved gas analysis furnace. After loading the sample into the furnace, the sample was heated to 500 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C min
−1
in 10% O
2
in N
2
(25 ml min
−1
). CO pulse chemisorption measurements were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. In brief, ~40 mg of the sample was loaded in a quartz U-tube and calcined in 10% O
2
in Ar followed by a reduction in 10% H
2
in Ar at 150 °C for 2 h. Next, the sample was cooled to room temperature, and CO pulses (10% CO in He) were introduced to the sample until saturation.
In situ XAS
In situ XAS measurements at the Fe K-edge (7,112 eV) and Rh K-edge (23,220 eV) were performed in fluorescence mode with a Si(111) monochromator at the 1W1B beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) and in transmission mode with a Si(311) monochromator at the BL14W1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) in China, respectively, considering the loadings of Fe and Rh. The storage ring of the BSRF worked at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA, and the storage ring of the SSRF worked at 3.5 GeV with a maximum current of 210 mA. A homemade reaction cell was used for the in situ experiments, which allows exposing the sample to different pretreatment gases or reaction gases, as well as sample heating to 500 °C. Typically, the as-prepared 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
sample was compressed into tablets and put into the reaction cell. After purging with He for 10 min at room temperature, the XAFS spectra were recorded and denoted as 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-O. After that, the sample was reduced in 10% H
2
in He at 400 °C for 1 h and then cooled to 260 °C for 10 min. The XAFS spectrum was recorded and denoted as 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-R. Finally, the same sample was exposed to syngas consisting of 24% CO and 72% H
2
balanced with He at 260 °C for another 1 h, and the XAFS spectra were sequentially recorded and denoted as 6Fe-Rh/ZrO
2
-S. The acquired XAS data were processed according to standard procedures using the ARTEMIS module implemented in the IFEFFIT software package. The EXAFS oscillation functions
χ
(
k
) were obtained by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption spectra and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step.
In situ XPS
In situ XPS measurements were conducted at the BL10B beamline Photoemission End-station at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in Hefei, China. In brief, the beamline is connected to a bending magnet and covers photon energies from 100 eV to 1,000 eV. The end-station consists of four chambers, that is, an analysis chamber, a preparation chamber, a quick sample load lock chamber and a high-pressure reactor. The analysis chamber, with a base pressure of <5 × 10
−10
torr, is connected to the beamline and equipped with a VG Scienta R3000 electron energy analyser and a twin anode X-ray source. After sample treatment, the reactor was pumped down to high vacuum (<10
−8
torr) for sample transfer. In the current work, the sample was first reduced with the flowing 10% H
2
in Ar at 400 °C for 1 h followed by treatment in syngas (24% CO, 72% H
2
, 4% Ar) (20 ml min
−1
) at 260 °C for another 1 h at the ambient pressure in the high-pressure reactor. Next, the sample was transferred to the analysis chamber for XPS measurements in the Fe 2
p
and Rh 3
d
region without exposing to air.
DRIFTS of CO chemisorption measurements
DRIFTS of CO chemisorption was performed on a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector and a low-temperature reaction cell (Praying Mantis Harrick). After loading a sample into the cell, it was reduced under 10% H
2
in Ar at 360 °C (the highest temperature that we can reach) for 2 h. After cooling the sample to room temperature in Ar, a background spectrum was collected. Subsequently, the sample was exposed to 10% CO in Ar (20 ml min
−1
) for approximately 30 min until saturation. Next, the sample was purged with Ar (20 ml min
−1
) for another 30 min to remove the gas-phase CO, after which the DRIFT spectrum was collected with 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm
−1
.
In situ DRIFTS of CO hydrogenation
In situ DRIFTS was performed on the same instrument described above. After loading a sample into the cell, it was reduced in 10% H
2
in Ar at 360 °C for 2 h. Then, the sample was cooled to 260 °C in Ar, and a background spectrum was collected. Next, the sample was exposed to 10% CO in Ar (20 ml min
−1
, 0.1 MPa) at the same temperature. After a 20 min reaction, the inlet was switched to Ar for another 20 min to remove the gaseous CO. Next, the inlet was subsequently switched to 10 H
2
in Ar (20 ml min
−1
). Moreover, DRIFTS spectra were recorded to monitor the changes in the intensities of different surface species during the entire process.
Catalyst evaluation
The conversion of syngas was carried out in a stainless-steel tubular fixed-bed reactor (Anhui CHEM Machinery Technology) equipped with a quartz lining with an inner diameter of 10 mm. In a typical reaction, 100 mg of Rh-based catalyst mixed with 1 g of quartz sand (30–60 mesh) was loaded into the reactor and reduced in 10% H
2
in N
2
(30 ml min

) at 400 °C for 2 h. After reduction, the sample was cooled to 260 °C, and then, syngas (24% CO, 72% H
2
) with 4% Ar as an internal standard was introduced into the reactor and pressurized slowly to 2.5 MPa. The data were collected after at least 2 h on stream. Products were analysed by an online GC (Panna A91 PLUS). A capillary column (PLOT-Q) connected to a flame ionization detector (FID) was used to analyse CH
4
, C
2
–
4
paraffins and oxygenated products; a TDX-01 packed column connected with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to analyse CO, CO
2
, Ar and CH
4
. CH
4
was taken as a reference bridge between the FID and TCD.
CO conversion (X(CO)) was calculated on a carbon atom basis, that is,
$${\mathrm{X}}\left({\mathrm{{CO}}}\right)=\frac{{\mathrm{CO}}_{\mathrm{in}}\,-{\mathrm{CO}}_{\mathrm{out}}}{{\mathrm{CO}}_{\mathrm{in}}}\times 100 \%$$
(1)
where CO
in
and CO
out
in equation (
1
) represent the moles of CO at the inlet and outlet, respectively.
The CO
2
selectivity (S(CO
2
)) was calculated according to
$${\mathrm{S}}\left({{\rm{CO}}}_{2}\right)=\frac{{{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}}_{\mathrm{out}}}{{\mathrm{CO}}_{\mathrm{in}}-\,{\mathrm{CO}}_{\mathrm{out}}}\times 100 \%$$
(2)
where CO
2outt
in equation (
2
) represents moles of CO
2
at the outlet.
The selectivity
S
for each organic product
i
was determined on the basis of the number of C atoms by equation (
3
), where
n
i
in equation (
3
) represents the moles of product
i
at the outlet and
C
i
is the carbon number of product
i
. The carbon balance over the Rh-based catalysts was greater than 98%.
$${S}_{i}=\frac{{n}_{i}{C}_{i}}{\sum {n}_{i,\,j}{C}_{i,\,j}}\times 100 \%$$
(3)
The STY of EtOH was calculated according to
$${\mathrm{STY}}\left({\rm{EtOH}}\right)=\frac{{F}_{\mathrm{CO}}S\left({\mathrm{EtOH}}\right)}{2\times W}\times 46$$
(4)
where
F
CO
denotes the molar number of converted CO molecules per unit time (mmol
(C)
h
−1
) and
w
denotes the weight of the catalyst.
Computational methods
All spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)
60
. Projector augmented wave
61
potentials and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional
62
were used. The kinetic energy cut-off was specified to be 400 eV. Electronic optimizations were converged to 10
−4
eV per atom, and the geometry optimizations were considered to be converged until the forces on each ion were less than 0.05 eV Å
−1
. The optimized lattice parameters for bulk
t
-ZrO
2
are
a
=
b
= 3.66 Å and
c
= 5.25 Å, which are in line with the experimental values of
a
=
b
= 3.61 Å and
c
= 5.21 Å (ref.
63
). The strongly correlated 4
d
orbital of Zr was treated with the GGA +
U
correction with
U
eff
= 4 eV, which has been suggested in other theoretical works. The calculated equilibrium lattice constants for FCC Rh are
a
=
b
=
c
= 3.82 Å, which are consistent with the experimental values of 3.80 Å (ref.
64
).
The most stable
t
-ZrO
2
(101) facet with one isolated hydroxyl group and one oxygen vacancy was used to simulate the pristine defective, hydroxylated
t
-ZrO
2
surface according to the EPR and DRIFTS measurements (Supplementary Figs.
4
and
31
), where a
p
(4 × 3) supercell slab with a two-layer oxide thickness was used. The adsorbates and the topmost oxide are relaxed. The stepped Rh(211) surface is modelled using a
p
(3 × 2) slab with five atomic layers, including 60 Rh atoms. During optimization, the adsorbates and the top three layers of Rh atoms are relaxed. The neighbouring slabs were separated by a 15 Å vacuum to avoid interactions between them. Monkhorst–Pack
k
-point meshes of 1 × 2 × 1 and 2 × 3 × 1 were used to sample the Brillouin zones of the
t
-ZrO
2
(101) and Rh(211) supercell surface slab models, respectively.
The improved force reversal method
65
was used to identify the transition states (TS) via vibrational analysis until all the forces were less than 0.05 eV Å
−1
. Some of the TSs were determined by climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB)
66
and dimer methods
67
. The adsorption energy is calculated as
E
ads
=
E
adsorbate/slab
−
E
slab
−
E
adsorbate
, where
E
adsorbate/slab
and
E
slab
are the total energies of the slab with the adsorbate and the clean surface, respectively, and
E
adsorbate
is the energy of the adsorbate in the gas phase. The reaction energy and barrier were calculated by Δ
E
=
E
FS
−
E
IS
and
E
a
=
E
TS
−
E
IS
, where
E
IS
,
E
FS
and
E
TS
are the energies of the corresponding initial state, final state and transition state, respectively. The structure of Rh
20
/
t
-ZrO
2
(101) was obtained by a genetic algorithm.
