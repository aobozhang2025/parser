Abstract
Carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) are widely accepted as stable, cost-effective photovoltaics. However, C-PSCs have been suffering from relatively low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) due to severe electrode-related energy loss. Herein, we report the application of a single-atom material (SAM) as the back electrode in C-PSCs. Our Ti
1
–rGO consists of single titanium (Ti) adatoms anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in a well-defined Ti
1
O
4
-OH configuration capable of tuning the electronic properties of rGO. The downshift of the Fermi level notably minimizes the series resistance of the carbon-based electrode. By combining with an advanced modular cell architecture, a steady-state PCE of up to 20.6% for C-PSCs is finally achieved. Furthermore, the devices without encapsulation retain 98% and 95% of their initial values for 1,300 h under 1 sun of illumination at 25°C and 60 °C, respectively.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the emerging third generation photovoltaics have experienced rapid development over the past 10 years and achieved a certificated high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 25.5% so far
1
. However, the stability issue remains the main obstacle slowing down the large-scale application of PSCs
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
. Studies in recent years have revealed that the most widely used Ag or Au back electrodes in traditional PSCs are one of the main sources leading to the deterioration of cell performance as they corrode easily, where the metallic bonds (Ag–Ag or Au–Au) are likely to be broken by the iodide from the perovskite layer underneath
6
,
9
,
10
. Replacing metal back electrodes with carbon-based ones has been validated to be a good strategy
11
,
12
,
13
. The hydrophobic nature as well as the stable covalent bond structure endows carbon-based back electrodes with excellent moisture resistance and chemical stability, avoiding the corrosion as mentioned above
13
. In general, the stability of Carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) is much better than that of traditional PSCs
7
,
12
,
13
,
14
. Despite being widely accepted as the stable, cost effective and large-scale processable photovoltaics, C-PSCs have been suffering from severe energy loss caused by the carbon electrode itself and the carbon–perovskite or carbon–spiro-OMeTAD interface
14
,
15
,
16
. As a consequence, the PCEs of C-PSCs are generally much lower than those of traditional PSCs
12
,
13
,
14
, mostly in a wide range between 10 and 18% as statistically summarized from relevant reports (Supplementary Fig.
1
and Supplementary Table
1
)
17
,
18
. The key to increase efficiencies to the same level as thermal evaporation metal-based PSC is to minimize the energy loss originating from the retarded rate of charge transport and transfer, which comes from the large sheet resistance of a carbon electrode, the poor interfacial contact and the mismatched band alignment between carbon electrode and adjacent functional layer
15
,
19
,
20
. For example, we have reported a type of C-PSC structure incorporating a highly conductive substrate (such as conductive glass or metal foil) as a charge collector that cooperated with a carbon electrode to jointly speed up charge transport, by which the energy loss related to horizontal transport was reduced notably
14
.
As a unique two-dimensional (2D) carbon material, graphene has been regarded as a good back contact candidate for C-PSCs owing to its excellent electrical properties (such as high conductivity and tunable energy level)
14
,
15
,
21
. Over the past few years, back electrodes based on graphene or its composites have been intensively exploited for C-PSCs
15
,
21
,
22
,
23
. However, the PCEs of corresponding devices have only been around 10–12% in most previous reports (Supplementary Fig.
2
)
15
,
16
,
21
,
22
,
23
. Tuning the electrical properties of graphene, such as by heteroatom doping (such as N, O, S, P), has been applied to boost the PCE of C-PSCs
16
,
24
. An example reported by Zhu and coworkers in 2018 indicated that, owing to the increased charge-extraction efficiency and transport capability, the N-doped graphene framework as the back electrodes enabled the PCE of C-PSCs to be enhanced from 9.0% to 10.3% with respect to the undoped sample
16
. In recent years, the increasing theoretical prediction and experimental demonstration show that the electrical properties of graphene, for example, the work function, can be well regulated by the decoration of metal nanoparticles or metal salts
25
,
26
. However, the inhomogeneity of the distribution of metal species and their ambiguous bonding configurations with the graphene pose a serious obstacle to clearly identifying the precise structure at atomic level and to further establishing the structural correlation with electrical properties.
Featuring atomically dispersed metal atoms and well-defined coordination structures on solid substrates, single-atom materials (SAMs) have emerged as an exciting class of materials with many appealing advantages for heterogeneous catalysis (in this field, they are usually termed single-atom catalysts)
27
,
28
,
29
,
30
,
31
. However, so far SAMs have scarcely been applied or investigated in the photoelectric field
30
,
31
.
Herein, we report the application of SAM as the back contact in all solid-state solar cells. Our SAM of Ti
1
–rGO consists of single titanium (Ti) adatoms anchored by surface oxygen atoms on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in a well-defined configuration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the evident charge transfer between rGO and Ti adatoms, which leads to notable variations in the electronic structure with regard to the bare rGO, consistent with the subsequent experimental validation. As a result, the downshift of Fermi level notably minimizes the series resistance of the carbon-based transport layer minimizing the energy loss. By combining with an advanced modular cell architecture in which fluorine-doped SnO
2
(FTO) is used as a charge collector, a high steady-state PCE up to 20.6% is finally achieved by our Ti
1
–rGO-based C-PSCs, evidently higher than that (17.5%) of the control device based on the bare rGO. Furthermore, the Ti
1
–rGO-based C-PSC without encapsulation cells retain 98% and 95% of their initial PCE values during light soaking with full solar intensity under maximum power point tracking for 1,300 h under nitrogen at 25 and 60 °C, respectively.
Coordination structure of a Ti atom in Ti
1
–rGO
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows that unlike the ideal graphene, the residual oxygen on rGO is still abundant (roughly 10 at.%) even after a thermal reduction treatment at 550 °C (Supplementary Fig.
3a
). The high-resolution XPS C 1 s spectrum (Supplementary Fig.
3b
) reveals that the residual oxygen exists in the form of mixed oxygen-containing species, such as hydroxyl (–OH), epoxide (C–O–C) and carboxyl (C–OO). These oxo species provide potential anchoring sites for Ti adatoms according to the strong interaction between Ti and O atoms. Accordingly, the Ti
1
–rGO SAM sample was prepared via a simple chemisorption route (Fig.
1a
).

Figure
1b,c
shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the as-synthesized Ti
1
–rGO samples. It can be clearly observed that the Ti
1
–rGO appears as an ultrathin, wrinkled and interlaced sheet, similar to the rGO sample (Supplementary Fig.
4
), which suggests that both Ti
1
–rGO and rGO samples retain the excellent flexibility of graphene
14
. The selected area electron diffraction pattern (the inset of Fig.
1c
) reveals that the Ti
1
–rGO sample mainly consists of layered graphene. In the TEM measurement, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping of Ti
1
–rGO was also performed on a small region. The EDX mapping of C, O and Ti confirms that these elements are uniformly distributed across the entire sample (Supplementary Fig.
5
). Subsequently, the dispersion of Ti atoms on the rGO was confirmed by the high-angle annular dark field–scanning TEM (HAADF–STEM). The bright spots in HAADF–STEM image (Fig.
1d
) correspond to Ti atoms and are homogeneously distributed throughout the entire Ti
1
–rGO sample. All the above analyses indicate the successful synthesis of rGO-supported single Ti atom material.
To circumvent the limited discrimination ability of the HAADF signal, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) was used with simultaneous HAADF signal to investigate the local bonding of individual Ti atom
32
. The EELS mapping of Ti
1
–rGO was acquired on a region around the centre of one isolated Ti atom from the large-area HAADF image. As presented in Fig.
1e
, it is apparent that the position of Ti atom (as depicted by the red arrow in the Ti–L
2,3
EELS map) corresponds exactly to that of the carbon vacancy, which shows that the Ti adatom is anchored into a carbon-vacancy defect of Ti
1
–rGO SAM. Besides, O distribution in the EELS map appears slightly gathered around the Ti atom, which indicates that the Ti atom most probably coordinates with oxygen atoms on rGO directly. Furthermore, the respective EELS spectrum for C, O and Ti elements around the Ti atom centre demonstrates the presence of C and O signals, indicative of the formation of Ti–O–C bonding (Supplementary Fig.
6
).
The synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended XAFS (EXAFS) spectroscopy are used to further identify the coordination structure concerning Ti atom in Ti
1
–rGO (ref.
33
). As presented in Fig.
2a
, the Ti K-edge XANES spectra show that the absorption edge energy of Ti
1
–rGO lies between that of TiC and TiO
2
, corroborating that the oxidation state of Ti species in Ti
1
–rGO is about +4, which is further supported by XPS and XANES analysis (Supplementary Note
1
, Supplementary Fig.
7
and Supplementary Table
2
). Using the established metal oxidation versus
E
0
relationship, the Ti average valence state in the Ti
1
–rGO sample is estimated to be roughly +3.70 (Supplementary Fig.
7d
).

Quantitative evidence on the bonding characteristics of the Ti atoms in Ti

–rGO in Fig.

demonstrates that the main peak located at
R
≅
1.44 Å is close to that of TiO
2
reference, which can be ascribed to the Ti–O/C coordination. Besides, the copresence of a well-separated FT peak at
R
≅
2.42 Å much resembles those of pyridine or pyrrolic N atom-coordinated M–N
4
moiety in the previously reported M–N–C SAMs
34
,
35
. To interpret, we considered two separate Ti–O/C
1
and Ti–C
2
scattering paths. On the basis of the quantitative EXAFS curve-fitting analysis (Fig.
2c,d
and Supplementary Table
2
), the average Ti environment in Ti
1
–rGO comprises first-shell Ti–O (coordination number
N
= 4.9 ± 0.4,
R
= 1.94 ± 0.02 Å) and second shell Ti–C (
N
= 3.5 ± 0.6,
R
= 3.00 ± 0.04 Å). Considering the difficulties of EXAFS analysis in discriminating the C/O neighbours and the definite structural configuration, XANES simulations and DFT calculations on Bader charge analysis were further carried out to precisely interpret the definite atomic-site Ti

structure (Supplementary Note

, Supplementary Figs.

–

and Supplementary Table
4
). By contrast, the TiO
4
–OH can better reproduce the main features and give a relatively closer match with the experimental spectrum (Fig.
2e
), which is also supported by subsequent Bader charge analysis (Fig.
2f
).
Specifically, the calculated Ti valence state (+3.82) of the proposed TiO
4
–OH is much closer to that (+3.70) derived from the XANES analyses. On the other hand, the coordination number
N
Ti-C
= 3.5 at the second shell is slightly lower than that (
N
= 4.0) of the theoretically predicted structure, which could be due to the large structural disorder in our case or defects. As far as we concerned, this underestimation for
N
second-shell
of the photo-absorber is also often encountered in EXAFS fitting analysis of SAMs
34
,
36
. By virtue of combined theoretical and experimental study, our findings nonetheless indicate that isolated TiO
4
–OH moiety species were dominantly formed on the rGO support. By consulting the aforementioned EELS results, we therefore propose the formation of such a specific moiety is because Ti adatoms can be anchored by oxygen atoms at the rGO vacancy defect.
Electronic properties of Ti
1
–rGO electrode
First, the influence of introducing atomic titanium on the electrical property of the rGO electrode was theoretically investigated by DFT calculation. As displayed in Fig.
3a
, the energy band structure based on a rGO structure model (inset of in Fig.
3a
) shows a band gap of 0.3 eV (energy bands are discontinuous near the Fermi level) leading to non-metallic behaviour, which is disadvantageous for conductivity. Fortunately, there is a shift of the Fermi level into the valence band for Ti
1
–rGO (Fig.
3b
) leading to a metallic behaviour and, concomitantly, to better conductivity. The electrostatic potential along the
z
axis and detailed parameter calculated for rGO and Ti
1
–rGO in Fig.
3c,d
and Supplementary Table
5
predict that the Ti single atom loaded on rGO will lead to a substantially increase in the work function (
W
F
) from 4.04 eV (rGO) to 4.79 eV (Ti
1
–rGO).

, the Fermi levels of rGO and spiro-OMeTAD show an energy mis-alignment of 200 meV, which could result in a

loss whereas those of Ti

–rGO and spiro-OMeTAD are well aligned avoiding any significant voltage loss during interfacial hole transfer from spiro-OMeTAD to Ti

Performance and stability of Ti
1
–rGO-based C-PSCs
The various improved electrical properties of Ti
1
–rGO motivate us to scrutinize whether the improvement in basis properties of Ti
1
–rGO electrode material can be translated into performance enhancement of the entire C-PSCs device. To this end, we used rGO and Ti
1
–rGO as the electrode materials of modular C-PSC with advanced architecture, respectively, which were assembled by stacking a semicell A (FTO/electron extraction layer (ETL)/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/graphene) and charge collector B (FTO/graphene) with very a small mechanical pressure (around 4.7 kPa, Supplementary Figs.
12
and
13
). As schematically illustrated in Fig.
4a
, such an architecture has been proved to possess numerous advantages, such as being easily assembled, disassembled, repaired and upgraded and so on
14
. More importantly, the modular C-PSCs is more advantageous by virtue of using a highly conductive collector to accelerate horizontal charge transport as aforementioned
14
. In the present study, we aim to use SAM to further reduce the energy loss caused by mismatched band alignment between perovskite and carbon electrode.

oc
) of 1.059 V, a short-circuit current density (
J
sc
) of 26.0 mA cm
−
2
, a fill factor of 78.5% and a PCE of 21.6%, which surpasses that of champion rGO-based C-PSC (17.7%) and is closer to the PCE (23.5%) of Au-PSCs (Supplementary Fig.
14
). Note that the Ti
1
–rGO-based C-PSC presents an elevated fill factor of up to 78.5%, in comparison to 69.3% for the control rGO-based C-PSC, as a result of the improved electrical properties of Ti
1
–rGO as we show further below. To exclude hysteresis effects in the PCE determination we measured the steady-state maximum power points (ss-MPPs), that is, a time-dependent MPP measurement, has been carried out until the MPP stabilized (Fig.
4e
). The detailed parameters of the ss-MPPs can be found in inset of Fig.
4e
. For the rGO device we obtained a stabilized PCE of 17.5% and for the Ti
1
–rGO device 20.6%. The latter is a high PCE for a C-PSC.
To evaluate the reason behind the device performance difference of rGO and Ti
1
–rGO-based perovskite solar cells we performed
J
sc
–
V
oc
measurements, which have been used to determine the series resistance of solar cell devices
38
,
39
. Figure
4f
shows the
J
sc
–
V
oc
curves of the rGO and Ti
1
–rGO devices. The
J
sc
–
V
oc
curves of both devices are nearly the same, which indicates that the main performance difference between the two devices comes from a different series resistance. To illustrate this further, we depict the reverse sweep
JV
curves and the
J
sc
–
V
oc
curves (Supplementary Fig.
15
). For the rGO device the
JV
sweeps deviate significantly from the
J
sc
–
V
oc
traces whereas for Ti
1
–rGO they nearly overlap. To quantify this behaviour, we calculate the series resistance at MPP. With the voltage difference Δ
V
between V
MPP
and the
J
sc
–
V
oc
curve at
J
MPP
(inset of Fig.
4f
) the series resistance at MPP is
R
s
(MPP) = Δ
V
/
J
MPP
. For the rGO device the series resistance is 7.0 Ω cm
−
2
and for the Ti
1
–rGO device 1.3 Ω cm
−
2
. This shows that the series resistance of the rGO layer is significantly larger than that of the Ti
1
–rGO layer and this is the main reason for the performance difference.
To verify the universality of carbon electrode in different perovskite cell architectures, we also applied the rGO and Ti
1
–rGO contact layers to another perovskite solar cell architecture using low-temperature processed SnO

as perovskite layer (labelled as perovskite

)
40
. The device architecture is FTO/SnO
2
/perovskite
2
/spiro-OMeTAD/rGO or Ti
1
–rGO. A high PCE up to 19.8% is achieved by our Ti
1
–rGO-based device, evidently higher than that (16.8%) of the control device based on the bare rGO (Supplementary Note
4
, Supplementary Figs.
16
and
17
and Supplementary Table
6
). Those results are similar to that of the device with TiO
2
as ETL, which further demonstrates the wide application of Ti
1
–rGO as high-performance electrode materials.
Here, an important fact worth noting is that the hole transport layer (HTL), such as spiro-OMeTAD used in our C-PSCs, is indispensable to minimize charge recombination. We fabricated Ti
1
–rGO-based and rGO-based HTL-free C-PSCs (see detailed results and analysis in Supplementary Fig.
18
, Supplementary Table
7
and Supplementary Note
5
). The PCEs of both Ti
1
–rGO-based and rGO-based HTL-free devices are evidently inferior to that of the one containing HTL due to a major loss in fill factor and
V
oc
. This can be ascribed to the metallic nature of Ti
1
–rGO or rGO due to which the hole extraction is not as selective as that in the case using HTL, and the back-transfer of electron cannot be blocked effectively, in turn leading to serious charge recombination at the (Ti
1
–rGO)/perovskite or rGO/perovskite interface. Therefore, HTL is thought to be essential to achieve high efficiency C-PSCs. Meantime, the comparison between the highest PCEs of semicell A and a modular C-PSCs (8.6% versus 21.6%) provides very strong experimental support to validate the necessity of charge collector B (see detailed results and analysis in Supplementary Fig.
19
, Supplementary Table
8
and Supplementary Note
6
).
In addition, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
20
, the device using cheap Al foil as a substrate in charge collector B still realized a high PCE up to 20.9%, providing many options in terms of the conductive substrate in charge collector B and being favourable to further reducing production cost.
Furthermore, in terms of an exceptional electrode material, stability of Ti
1
–rGO is also our focus. The operational stability data obtained with Ti
1
–rGO-based C-PSCs and conventional thermal evaporation Au-based PSCs (Au-PSCs) at MPP under the same condition (1 sun irradiation and in N
2
atmosphere) were measured to reflect the stability of the electrode materials. As illustrated in Fig.
4g
and Supplementary Fig.
21
, the PCE at MPP of Au–PSC rapidly decayed from 21.8% to 14.3% after 1,100 h continuous irradiation at 25 °C, with only 65% of the initial value being retained. By contrast, the operational stability of Ti
1
–rGO-based C-PSC without encapsulation is excellent while its PCE at MPP can maintain 98% (20.2%) of its initial value (20.7%) after continuous irradiation for 1,300 h at 25 °C. Even at 60 °C, the PCE at MPP of Ti
1
–rGO-based C-PSC can maintain 95% (19.7%) of its initial value (20.6%) after continuous irradiation for 1,300 h, indicating that Ti
1
–rGO can well resolve the instability issue caused by the corrosion of the precious metal electrode. It can be seen that the efficiency and stability of modular C-PSCs have been simultaneously improved by comparison to our previous work
14
. More importantly, this study signifies that SAMs will be excellent candidates to serve as an electrode or interfacial layer in all solid-state photovoltaics, which will arouse wide attention in future studies.
Conclusions
In summary, we report the application of SAM with a well-defined structure as back contact for high-performance perovskite solar cells. DFT calculations indicate the evident charge transfer between rGO and Ti adatoms, which leads to a substantially improved conductivity of the Ti
1
–rGO charge transport material. As expected, by combination with an advanced modular cell architecture, a steady-state PCE of up to 20.6% is achieved based on this unique back contact material. Moreover, the Ti
1
–rGO-based C-PSC without encapsulation displays an excellent stability while its MPP tracking under in full sun still retain 98% and 95% of their initial values for 1,300 h (1 sun, in N
2
atmosphere) at 25°C and 60 °C, respectively. This work not only provides an avenue to engineer efficient and stable electrode materials for C-PSCs, but also deepens the understanding of the correlation between electronic device properties and chemical structure.

Preparation of Ti
1
–rGO and rGO
The Ti
1
–rGO SAM sample was prepared via chemisorption route. First, 400 mg of graphite oxide was dispersed into 120 ml of isopropanol. Then, 20 μl of organic Ti salt (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)) was added into the above solution with continuous magnetic stirring, followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 1 h and magnetic stirring for 20 h. Afterwards, the above dispersion solution was centrifuged and the resulting precipitation was dried at 85 °C in vacuum for 24 h. Thereafter, the obtained powder was calcinated at 550 °C for 2 h in a high-purity N
2
atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the fluffy black powder was Ti
1
–rGO SAM. Likewise, rGO could be obtained by the same steps without adding organic Ti salt.
Fabrication of modular C-PSCs
Here, 10 mg of carbon material (rGO or Ti
1
–rGO) was dispersed into 20 ml of isopropanol solution, followed by ball-milling for 12 h. The dispersion slurry for spraying was obtained. FTO glasses were etched with zinc powder and 4 M HCl, rinsed with cleaning fluid, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol, respectively.

When the FTO glass was preheated to 450 °C, the compact TiO

). The precursor solution of the compact TiO
2
layer (c-TiO

) was diluted 600 μl of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) and 400 μl of acetyl acetone with 9 ml of ethanol. After spray pyrolysis, the FTO/c-TiO

was sintered at 450 °C for 10 min before cooling down to room temperature. After that, mesoporous TiO

(mp-TiO

and 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s with an acceleration rate of 2,000 r.p.m. s

(0.2 M) were dissolved in 1 ml of mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1 volume ratio), and then stirred at 60 °C for 2 h. Next, 1 M CsI DMSO solution was added to the above perovskite precursor solution with a volume ratio of 5:95. Subsequently, 120 μl of perovskite solution was spin coated on the ETL via a two-step spin-coating programme with 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 6,000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. Then 300 μl of antisolvent (α,α,α-trifluorotoluene) was dropped on the spinning substrates 20 s before the end of programme, followed by annealing at 85 °C for 45 min.
The spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was obtained via adding 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD powder, 29 μl of TBP, 17.5 μl of Li-TFSI acetonitrile solution (520 mg ml
−1
) into chlorobenzene (1 ml). Afterwards, 50 μl of the spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin coated on the above perovskite films at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The semicell was obtained successfully. Then 500 μl of carbon slurry based on rGO or Ti
1
–rGO was sprayed on the above semicells (FTO/ETL/perovskite/HTL) and FTO substrates on a hotplate at 85 °C to accelerate solvent evaporation. The obtained semicell A (FTO/ETL/perovskite/HTL/carbon) and charge collector B (FTO/carbon) were then assembled into modular C-PSC by being stacked together using retaining clips, and the overall thickness of graphene on two carbon electrodes was compressed to about 2 μm.
Characterizations
The STEM images of Ti
1
–rGO SAM sample were acquired using a STEM (JEOL ARM-200F) equipped with an aberration corrector (CEOS CESCOR) at the probe side, which was operated at the accelerating voltage of 80 kV. The dwell time per pixel was set to 10–16 μs. The morphologies of samples were characterized by SEM (SU8220) and STEM (F-20, FEI). A double Si(111)-crystal monochromator was adopted for energy selection. The energy was calibrated by the Ti foil.
JV
characteristics of modular C-PSCs were conducted on a digital source meter (Keithley 2450) at the scan speed of 100 mV s
−
1
. The simulated AM 1.5G sunlight (irradiance equivalent to 100 mW cm
−2
) calibrated by standards Si reference cell (Si photodiode (FDS1010-CAL from Thorlabs) with a KG5 filter, calibrated by Newport) was generated by a solar simulator (Newport Sol 3A). We continuously verify our measurements with PV certification laboratories (Fraunhofer ISE). The modular C-PSCs were masked with a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.09 cm
2
during
JV
measurement. The stable output of photocurrent and PCE were detected with a digital source meter (Keithley 2450) at a certain bias. The IPCE spectrometry was performed using a commercial apparatus (Aekeo-Ariadne, Cicci Research s.r.l.) with a 300-W Xenon lamp. Stability of the cells were recorded under a white light-emitting diode lamp with biologic MPG2 potentiostat and N
2
atmosphere. The spectral mismatch between AM 1.5G and the simulated sunlight was calibrated with a Schott K113 Tempax filter.
STEM–EELS measurements and data analysis
The Ti
1
–rGO powder was uniformly dispersed by sonication in high-purity ethanol, then the solution was dropped onto a 400-mesh lacey-carbon gold grid for the EELS mapping in the STEM mode (STEM–EELS). Before the STEM–EELS measurements, the grid was annealed at 100 °C in a high vacuum chamber of roughly 10
−
6
mbar overnight to completely remove the ethanol residual as well as any adsorbed vapour. The JEOL JEM ARM-200F equipped with the cold field-emission gun and the ASCOR fifth-order probe-side corrector was applied for the STEM–EELS experiments under 60 kV of accelerating voltage to avoid sample damage. The 30-mrad convergence semi-angle and roughly 120-pA probe current were selected for the optimized information transfer and single-atom sensitivity
41
. An energy dispersion of 0.25 eV per channel and 91-mrad collection semi-angle in the Gatan Enfinium ER spectrometer were set up with corrected stigmatism up to the third order. Each STEM–EELS map was acquired using 1 ms dwell time (near 1,000 spectra per second) and 0.25 Å pixel size to maintain a relatively low electron dose. The zero-loss peak and core-loss edges were simultaneously recorded for the absolute energy scale. The simultaneous annular dark field signal was acquired using a 93-mrad inner collection semi-angle. The signal-to-noise ratio of the single-pixel spectrum in the STEM–EELS dataset under as-described experimental conditions is low but adequate to distinguish the Ti–L
3
and –L
2
edges (fine structures visible when averaged across the whole sampled region). The spectrum background was subtracted using the method of local background averaging and linear combination of two power laws to benefit from the redundant sampling
42
. Instead of the direct integration of the Ti edges, we carried out principal component analysis first to search for the reference spectrum of Ti
1
, then non-negative least-square fitting of the spectra dataset by the reference spectrum generated the Ti concentration map of enormously improved contrast.
X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements and data analysis
The Ti K-edge XAFS spectra were collected at BL11B beamline in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Notably, here we adapted a common practice of multiple scans for the XAFS measurements of Ti
1
–rGO and the average of four scans were collected. Some details of the XAFS measurements and data analysis were as follows: the hard X-ray was monochromatized with Si(111) double-crystal monochromator and the harmonic rejection mirror was used to remove monochromator harmonics. The as-prepared Ti
1
–rGO sample was first pelletized as disc of 10 mm and the XAFS data were collected in fluorescence mode (Lytle detector) in the energy range from −200 below to 800 eV above the Ti K-edge. The acquired EXAFS data were processed according to the standard procedures using the ATHENA module implemented in the IFEFFIT software packages
43
. The

were FT to real (

) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. The EXAFS curve-fittings were performed using the ARTEMIS module of IFEFFIT
44
. Effective backscattering amplitudes
F
(

k
) of all fitting paths were calculated with the ab initio code FEFF8.0 (ref.

Computational models and methods
Ti
1
–rGO and rGO computational models were constructed based on 6 × 6 × 1 supercells of graphene, and the box size was 14.76 × 14.76 × 16.70 Å. Neighbouring slabs were separated through a vacuum of 15 Å to avoid interaction. The DFT calculations were performed with projector-augmented wave potentials and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional was implemented by the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package
46
,
47
. Relaxations were performed using a conjugate-gradient algorithm. The selected energy convergence was 1 × 10
−4
eV atom and force convergence was 0.05 eV Å. The cut-off energy was set to 400 eV. A Monkhorst–Pack point sampling of 4 × 4 × 1 was adopted. The occupancy of the one-electron states was revealed using Gaussian smearing (SIGMA, 0.05 eV).
J

V
oc
measurement technique
The starting point of the
J
sc
–
V
oc
technique is the single-diode approximation with negligible shunt resistance:
$$J\left( {V,L,R_{\mathrm{s}}} \right) = J_0\left( {1 - {\mathrm{e}}^{\frac{{q(V + R_{\mathrm{s}}J)}}{{nk_{\mathrm{B}}T}}}} \right) + J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}(L)$$

Here,

the device temperature.
J
sc
(

) and
V

(
L
) are measured for a series of light intensities
L
, which yields a pseudo
JV
curve
\(J_{{\mathrm{s}}c}^ \ast (V)\)
, where
\(J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}^ \ast (V) \equiv J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}(L)\)
with
V
=
V
oc
(
L
). For
R
s
= 0, from equation (
1
) the following relationships are derived:
$$\begin{array}{l}J\left( {V_{{\mathrm{oc}}}\left( L \right),L,R_{\mathrm{s}} = 0} \right) = 0 \to J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}\left( L \right) = J_0\left( {e^{\frac{{qV_{{\mathrm{oc}}}(L)}}{{nk_{\mathrm{B}}T}}} - 1} \right)\\ J\left( {V,1{\mathrm{sun}},R_{\mathrm{s}} = 0} \right) = J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}\left( {1{\mathrm{sun}}} \right) - J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}^ \ast (V)\end{array}$$
(2)
J
(
V
, 1 sun,
R

JV
curve of the device with zero series resistance. In this work we call
J
(
V
,1 sun,
R
s
= 0) the
J
sc
–
V
oc
curve. At
J
MPP
we have the following relationships for the
JV
and the
J
sc
–
V
oc
curves, where for the latter
V

is by definition the voltage at
J
MPP
:
$$\begin{array}{l}J_{{\mathrm{MPP}}} = J\left( {V_{{\mathrm{MPP}}},1{\mathrm{sun}},R_{\mathrm{s}}} \right) = J_0\left( {1 - {\mathrm{e}}^{\frac{{q\left( {V_{{\mathrm{MPP}}} + R_{\mathrm{s}}J_{{\mathrm{MPP}}}} \right)}}{{nk_{\mathrm{B}}T}}}} \right) + J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}\left( {1{\mathrm{sun}}} \right)\\ J_{{\mathrm{MPP}}} = J\left( {V_0,1{\mathrm{sun}},R_{\mathrm{s}} = 0} \right) = J_0\left( {1 - {\mathrm{e}}^{\frac{{qV_0}}{{nk_{\mathrm{B}}T}}}} \right) + J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}\left( {1{\mathrm{sun}}} \right)\\ \to V_{{\mathrm{MPP}}} + R_{\mathrm{s}}J_{{\mathrm{MPP}}} = V_0 \to R_{\mathrm{s}} = (V_0 - V_{{\mathrm{MPP}}})/J_{{\mathrm{MPP}}}\end{array}$$
To determine
R
s
at MPP we have to determine the voltage difference Δ
V
=
V
o
–
V
MPP
of the real
JV
curve and the
J
sc
–
V
oc
curve at
J
MPP
and divide it by
J
MPP
.
Note that this technique is not restricted to devices that follow the singe-diode characteristics. In fact, the
J
sc
–
V
oc
method can be used for any solar cell that follows a characteristics of the form
J
(
V
,
L
,
R

) =
J
dark

) +
J

(

). One can also show that this method can even be applied if there is a non-negligible shunt resistance.
