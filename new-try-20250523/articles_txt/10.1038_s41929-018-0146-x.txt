Abstract
Single-atom catalysts exhibit intriguing properties and receive widespread interest for their effectiveness in promoting a variety of catalytic reactions, making them highly desired motifs in materials science. However, common approaches to the synthesis of these materials often require tedious procedures and lack appropriate interactions between the metal atoms and supports. Here, we report a simple and practical strategy to access the large-scale synthesis of single-atom catalysts via direct atoms emitting from bulk metals, and the subsequent trapping on nitrogen-rich porous carbon with the assistance of ammonia. First, the ammonia coordinates with the copper atoms to form volatile Cu(NH
3
)
x
species based on the strong Lewis acid–base interaction. Then, following transportation under an ammonia atmosphere, the Cu(NH
3
)
x
species are trapped by the defects on the nitrogen-rich carbon support, forming the isolated copper sites. This strategy is readily scalable and has been confirmed as feasible for producing functional single-atom catalysts at industrial levels.

. Various synthetic strategies, including physical and chemical approaches, have emerged in recent years as enabling platforms to access SACs. The physical methods, such as mass-selected soft-landing
17
and atomic layer deposition
3
,
18
, suffer from low yields and high costs that are not favourable for large-scale production. The chemical routes involve tedious synthetic processes, including the adsorption of metal precursors, followed by reduction and stabilization on defect-rich supports
19
,
20
,
21
. The reported chemical synthesis routes are also relatively difficult to scale up because of the complex operating steps and sensitive conditions. Furthermore, under a high reactive temperature, aggregation and sintering of small nanoparticles and single atoms on the support is inevitable to some extent, which greatly hinders the practical applications of SACs. Therefore, the development of a practical and straightforward strategy for the synthesis of SACs with high thermal/chemical stability and ease of mass production is particularly attractive in the field.
In a recent interesting and pioneering example, Datye and co-workers described the preparation of platinum single atoms supported on CeO
2
by thermal diffusion from platinum nanoparticles
4
,
22
. In contrast with the synthesis of SACs from nanoparticles, studies of the direct fabrication of SACs from cheap and readily available bulk metal materials have rarely been reported.
Here, we describe a facile gas-migration strategy to directly transform bulk materials into single atoms onto a support with great potential for large-scale production. A schematic of the reaction is shown in Fig.
1a
: copper foam and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) were placed separately in a porcelain boat. The formation mechanism of copper single atoms supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu-SAs/N-C) is proposed in Fig.
1b
. First, the ZIF-8 was subjected to a pyrolysis process under an argon atmosphere at 1,173 K, forming pyrolysed ZIF-8 with empty zinc nodes and abundant defect sites. Under an ammonia atmosphere, ammonia molecules haul the surface copper atoms out of copper foam to form volatile Cu(NH

)
x
species based on strong Lewis acid–base interactions. Then, the Cu(NH
3
)
x
species were trapped by the defects of the nitrogen-rich carbon support, generating the isolated Cu-SAs/N-C catalysts. In addition, a series of M-SAs/N-C (M = Co or Ni) could be fabricated using this gas-migration method, demonstrating its generality to access a variety of functional SACs.

Results
Synthesis and structural characterization of Cu-SAs/N-C
The initial ZIF-8 exhibited a narrow size distribution (200 nm; Supplementary Fig.
1
) and a typical crystal pattern (Supplementary Fig.
2
). The pyrolysis process for ZIF-8 was carried out under an argon atmosphere in the presence of copper foam. As shown in Fig.
2a,b
, the structure of pyrolysed ZIF-8 retained its rhombododecahedral shape and corresponding size distribution. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Fig.
3
) reveal that the zinc atoms were volatilized under high temperature (1,173 K), without observable heavier metal atoms on the nitrogen-doped carbon support. This suggests that the argon gas was unable to haul the copper atoms out of the bulk copper foam, probably due to its fully filled outermost valence orbital. Correspondingly, the colour of the samples evolved from white to black (Supplementary Fig.
4
). When the argon atmosphere was switched to an ammonia atmosphere, the resultant Cu-SAs/N-C maintained its initial shape, but the boundary became more fluctuant (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Fig.
5
). The ring-like selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern depicts its low crystallinity (Fig.
2d
, inset). The copper, nitrogen and carbon elemental mappings of Cu-SAs/N-C reveal that copper and nitrogen were homogeneously dispersed over the whole architecture (Fig.
2e
).

The aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images of Cu-SAs/N-C confirm that the copper atoms were atomically dispersed on the support (Fig.
2f
and Supplementary Fig.
6
). Homogeneously dispersed single copper sites can clearly be observed according to the different intensity profiles (Supplementary Fig.
7
). The actual loading of copper was calculated to be 0.54% by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Supplementary Table
1
). The above results strongly support successful emitting of copper atoms from the bulk metal and trapping by the nitrogen-rich carbon.
By substituting ZIF-8 with graphene oxide as the defect-rich support, we observed that the isolated copper single atoms could be homogeneously dispersed on the graphene sheets. The SAED (Fig.
2g
, inset) results confirm the poor crystallinity of copper single atoms supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (Cu-SAs/N-G). Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was further employed to investigate the distribution of copper, nitrogen and carbon (Fig.
2h
). The nitrogen element was introduced into graphene through ammonia treatment at a high temperature
23
,
24
. The aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images of Cu-SAs/N-C confirm that the copper atoms were atomically dispersed on the support (Fig.
2i
). Abundant nitrogen functional groups on the graphene oxidation sheets served as effective defective sites for capturing copper atoms to form the Cu-SAs/N-G catalyst. The different intensity profiles further suggest the uniform dispersion of copper atoms for Cu-SAs/N-G (Supplementary Fig.
8
).
Atomic structure analysis of Cu-SAs/N-C by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS)
Copper foam maintains its typical crystal pattern after NH
3
treatment (Fig.
3a
), implying that only a small proportion of the surface atoms are dragged by the strongly coordinating NH
3
. No copper characteristic peaks were observed for Cu-SAs/N-C in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig.
3b
), further demonstrating its poor crystallinity. When the evaporation treatment was extended to 5 h, copper nanoparticles were generated on the nitrogen-doped carbon (Supplementary Fig.
9
), indicating the aggregation of copper single atoms. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the chemical valence states of the samples (Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Fig.
10
). For Cu-SAs/N-C, the copper 2
p
3/2
peak is at 933.0 eV, which is situated between Cu
0
(932.4 eV) and Cu
2+
(934.6 eV)
25
, suggesting the ionic Cu
δ
+
(0 <

< 2) nature of copper in Cu-SAs/N-C. This is in good agreement with previously reported results showing that the valence of copper species in Cu-SAs/N-C is between Cu(

) and Cu(

Extended XAFS (EXAFS) was performed to elucidate detailed structural information for the copper SAC. The EXAFS spectrum of R space for Cu-SAs/N-C exhibits a dominant Cu–N coordination at 1.48 Å (Fig.
3d
). For Cu-SAs/N-G, the main peak at 1.48 Å possesses a lower intensity, which suggests a different Cu–N coordination environment (Supplementary Table
2
). Additionally, no Cu–Cu characteristic peaks can be detected for either sample, implying that the isolated copper atoms were dispersed on these supports. As for copper foil, a main peak of Cu–Cu coordination was observed at 2.24 Å. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra show the intensity of the line for Cu-SAs/N-C situated between those for the copper foil and CuO (Fig.
3e
), further revealing its typical electronic structure (Cu
δ+
, 0 <
δ
< 2). This observation agrees with the XPS results. Based on these findings, the proposed local structure of Cu-SAs/N-C involves a coordination environment of one copper atom coordinated by four nitrogen atoms (Fig.
3f
and Supplementary Fig.
11
).
Experimental evaluation of oxygen reduction catalysis
A Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was performed and the results show that Cu-SAs/N-C possessed a specific surface area of 832 m
2
g
−1
and a highly open porous structure compared with pyrolysed ZIF-8 (Supplementary Fig.
12
). Based on the BET and ICP-AES results (Supplementary Table
1
), the surface coverage of copper atoms was calculated to be 0.06 atoms nm
−
2
. These merits suggest the potential applicability of Cu-SAs/N-C for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is an important half-reaction in energy-conversion devices
26
. Next, a steady-state linear sweep voltammetry technique was used to measure the ORR performance of samples. To exclude the influence of the N–C support, a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst was prepared by thermal treatment of ZIF-8 (a pure zinc-containing metal–organic framework) under argon. As expected, the pyrolysed ZIF-8 showed extremely poor activity towards the ORR (Fig.
4a
). This confirmed that the exceptional activity of Cu-SAs/N-C catalysts mainly stems from the N–C supported single-metal sites. Furthermore, Cu-SAs/N-C exhibited better ORR activity than Cu-SAs/N-G and commercial Pt/C catalysts in a comparison of the half-wave (
E
1/2
) potentials (Fig.
4a
and Supplementary Fig.
13
). For example, the
E
1/2
of Cu-SAs/N-C is 0.895 V, which is superior to those of Pt/C (0.87 V), Cu-SAs/N-G (0.74 V), copper nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu-NPs/N-C; 0.77 V) and cobalt single atoms supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Co-SAs/N-C; 0.85 V). We measured the values of specific activity (
j
specific
) at 0.9 V for Pt/C and Cu-SAs/N-C, which are normalized to the corresponding electrochemical specific surface areas (ECSAs) and BET surface area. The
j
specific
value obtained for Cu-SAs/N-C was 0.005 mA cm
−2
, indicating lower intrinsic activity than Pt/C (0.22 mA cm
−2
). The
j
specific
value for Pt/C matches the typical values for the commercial Pt/C catalyst

,

,

,

. Cu-SAs/N-C (0.68 Hz) showed a higher turnover frequency (TOF) than Pt/C (0.19 Hz), and outperformed most of the reported non-precious metal catalysts in terms of both
j
specific
and TOF (Supplementary Table
3
). Based on pioneering works
31
,
32
, several catalysts with different loadings (45–408 μg cm
−2
) were used to exclude the influence of electrode film thickness on ORR activity (Supplementary Fig.
14
). We noted that the kinetics current density scaled up with increased catalyst loading. Moreover, selectivity to H
2
O was retained at low catalyst loading.

Koutecky–Levich plots (Fig.
4b,
inset) show the first-order reaction kinetics of Cu-SAs/N-C, with nearly parallel fitting lines reflecting the O
2
concentration. This observation also indicates a potential independent electron transfer rate. Further analysis of the Koutecky–Levich plots (Fig.

, inset) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) testing show the near-four-electron ORR pathway for Cu-SAs/N-C (Fig.

). The kinetic current density (
j

) at 0.9 V and a lower Tafel slope of 63 mV dec

(Supplementary Fig.

) further confirmed the excellent activity of Cu-SAs/N-C. Importantly, no obvious activity decay was observed in
E
1/2
after 5,000 continuous potential cycles (Fig.
4d
).
Inspired by Mukerjee’s work
33
, the hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) and linear sweep voltammetry on an RRDE in O
2
-saturated acid and alkaline media were studied to better understand the performance of the Cu-SAs/N-C catalyst. As shown in Fig.
4e
and Fig.
4a
, the Cu-SAs/N-C catalyst exhibited a lower onset potential (0.83 V) for ORR in 0.1 M HClO
4
than in 0.1 M KOH (0.99 V). Furthermore, no observable diffusion-limited region was identified in 0.1 M HClO
4
, indicating kinetic control despite the high overpotential. The onset potential and potential of the mixed kinetic-diffusion region for the HPRR of Cu-SAs/N-C exhibited better performance in alkaline media than in acid media (Fig.
4f
). Furthermore, the H
2
O
2
yield in alkaline media was much lower than in acidic media during ORR on Cu-SAs/N-C (Supplementary Fig.
16a
), in line with the HPRR result. The weak selectivity of the four-electron process for Cu-SA/N-C at 0.1 M HClO
4
was further confirmed by RRDE testing (Supplementary Fig.
16b
). Together, these results demonstrate that the Cu-SAs/N-C catalyst in alkaline media is more favourable for four-electron reduction of O
2
than in acidic media, with minimal occurrence of the outer-sphere electron transfer mechanism in alkaline media
33
,
34
. Careful examination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), HAADF-STEM and XRD results (Supplementary Fig.
17
) confirmed that isolated copper atoms remained present following the durability tests. The EXAFS result of the Cu-SAs/N-C catalyst after ORR testing (Fig.
4g
) displays a main peak at 1.48 Å, further confirming that isolated copper atoms remained on the supports. Additionally, the fitting curve demonstrates that its coordination structure (Cu–N
4
) was preserved after ORR testing (Supplementary Table
2
). Together, these results provide strong evidence of the robust electrochemical stability of the Cu-SAs/N-C catalyst.
To explore the thermal stability of Cu-SAs/N-C, high-temperature treatment was carried out. HAADF-STEM results show that Cu-SAs/N-C maintained isolated copper sites after 973 K treatment in argon for 1 h (Supplementary Fig.
18
). XRD results show no observable characteristic peak for copper, further verifying the stability of single dispersed copper sites (Supplementary Fig.
19
). In sharp contrast, severe aggregation was observed for Cu-NPs/N-C under high temperature (Supplementary Figs.
18
and
19
). These results demonstrate the superior electrochemical and thermal stability of Cu-SAs/N-C prepared by this method. Additionally, copper SACs can easily be scaled up to produce excellent yields, fulfilling the requirement for large-scale production (Fig.
4h
). For example, the result in Supplementary Fig.
20
shows an essentially identical catalytic performance of the as-prepared copper SACs despite the significantly different amounts of precursors used.
Synthesis and structural characterization of Ni/Co-SAs/N-C
To test the generality of the gas-migration method, we employed different metal foams (metal = Co or Ni) to fabricate single-metal/N-C catalysts. HAADF-STEM images clearly show individual bright dots in Ni-SAs/N-C (Fig.
5a,b
) and Co-SAs/N-C (Fig.
5c,d
). XRD (Supplementary Fig.
21
) and HAADF-STEM (Supplementary Figs.
22
–
25
) results show that the atomically dispersed nickel and cobalt atoms were stabilized on nitrogen-doped carbon.

Conclusion
In summary, a gas-migration/NH
3
-mediated strategy that transforms bulk transition metals into metal SACs was developed and validated. Ammonia molecules serve as a medium to haul out copper atoms and anchor them to the volatilized zinc nodes of the ZIF-8 when treated at high temperature. The resultant Cu-SAs/N-C catalyst can endow superior ORR performance and exceptional electrochemical and thermal stability. The generality of this approach and critical role of the ammonia molecules were also confirmed. These new findings provide valuable guidance for the direct preparation of SACs from non-precious bulk metals, and show great potential for scaling up SACs towards industrial applications.
Methods
Chemicals
All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification, except copper foam. The copper, nickel and cobalt foams were washed with dilute HCl, distilled water and acetone, and dried in a vacuum at 353 K before use. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO
3
)
2
·6H
2
O), 2-methylimidazole and copper foam were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent. The commercial Pt/C catalyst contains ~3 nm platinum nanoparticles with 20wt%.
Synthesis of ZIF-8
Following a typical procedure, 0.558 g Zn(NO
3
)
2
·6H
2
O was dissolved in 20 ml methanol and subsequently added to 20 ml methanol containing 0.616 g 2-methylimidazole under ultrasound for 10 min at room temperature. The ZIF-8 was then grown under static at 308 K for 12 h. The precipitates were centrifuged, washed with methanol and dried in a vacuum at 338 K for overnight.
Synthesis of Cu-SAs/N-C
Following a normal procedure, the copper foam and powder of ZIF-8 (100 mg) were separately placed on a porcelain boat. The porcelain boat was heated in a tube furnace to 1,173 K (at 5 K min
−1
) in a stream of argon (10 ml min
−1
) for 1 h and then NH
3
(10 ml min
−1
) for 1 h to yield Cu-SAs/N-C. The yield of Cu-SAs/N-C was about 26 mg. The detailed scale-up process is shown in the
Supplementary Video
. The copper content was measured as 0.54 wt% based on ICP-AES analysis. For comparison, the copper foam and ZIF-8 were separately placed on the porcelain boat and heated to 1,173 K (at 5 K min
−1
) in a stream of argon (10 ml min
−1
) for 2 h to yield pyrolysed ZIF-8. Syntheses of Ni-SAs/N-C and Co-SAs/N-C were the same as for Cu-SAs/N-C, but using nickel foam or cobalt foam, respectively. Cu-NPs/N-C was prepared by extending the evaporation time to 5 h.
Synthesis of Cu-SAs/N-G
Copper foam and fluffy graphene oxide powder (50 mg) were placed separately on a porcelain boat and heated to 1,073 K (at 5 K min
−1
) for 1 h in a stream of NH
3
(10 ml min
−1
) to yield Cu-SAs/N-G. The copper content was measured as 1.26 wt% based on ICP-AES analysis.
Material characterizations
A Rigaku MiniFlex600 was used to measure powder X-ray diffraction patterns. TEM was performed using a Hitachi HT7700. High-resolution TEM testing was carried out using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN. HAADF-STEM images and corresponding EELS were obtained on a JEOL JEM-ARM200F TEM/STEM system. XPS was performed using Al Kα radiation (PHI 5000 Verasa, ULAC-PHI). For the core-level spectra, the carbon 1
s
feature located at 285.0 eV was used to calibrate the binding energies. Elemental analysis of copper in the solid samples was detected by ICP-AES (Optima 7300 DV). XAFS spectra at the copper K edge were collected at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (beamline 1W1B station) in China.
Electrochemical measurements for ORR
The samples (Cu-SAs/N-G, Cu-SAs/N-C, Co-SAs/N-C and 20 wt% Pt/C) were fabricated by mixing catalyst powder (4 mg) with a mixture (480 μl ethanol, 480 μl H
2
O and 40 μl 5% Nafion solution (Sigma–Aldrich)) under ultrasonic conditions for 20 min. In 0.1 M KOH solution, the loadings of non-precious catalyst and Pt/C were 90 and 102 μg cm
−2
, respectively. A three-electrode system was used to conduct the electrochemical measurements on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E). A glassy carbon rotating-disk electrode (RDE) of 5 mm in diameter coated with the catalyst ink served as the working electrode. Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. A graphite rod was used as the counter electrode to avoid any possible pollution of platinum. All potential values were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)
35
, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
26
. All current densities were corrected for the ohmic drop (that is, the iR drop) according to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results (Supplementary Fig.
27
)
28
.
Before the measurement, a stream of N
2
/O
2
flow was delivered to the electrolyte for 30 min to obtain an N
2
/O
2
-saturated solution. The net ORR curves were obtained by subtracting the background capacitance from those recorded with O
2
-saturated KOH. The background capacitance was recorded with the same potential range and scan rate, but in the N
2
-saturated KOH. TOFs of the Pt/C and Cu-SAs/N-C were calculated based on the mole number of active platinum atoms and copper single sites, respectively. The TOF values were obtained based on the equation:
$${\mathrm{TOF}} = \frac{{J \times a}}{{4 \times m \times F}}$$
(1)
where
J
represents the current density measured at 0.9 V,
a
is the surface area of the glassy carbon disk electrode (0.196 cm
2
), 4 is the number of electrons transferred during O
2
reduction,
m
is the mole number of active platinum atoms or copper single sites on the electrode, and
F
is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol
−1
).
The RDE measurement was performed at a sweep rate of 10 mV s
−1
with different rotating speeds (900 to 2,500 r.p.m.). The electron transfer number (
n
) and kinetic current density (
J
k
) were obtained according to the Koutecky–Levich equation:
$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{{J_{{\rm{l}}}}} + \frac{1}{{J_{{\rm{k}}}}} = \frac{1}{{B\omega ^{\frac{1}{2}}}} + \frac{1}{{J_{{\rm{k}}}}}$$

where
J
is the current density measured from the ORR,
J
k
is the kinetic current density,
J
l
is the limiting current density,
ω
represents the angular velocity of the disk,
C
0
is the bulk concentration of O
2
(1.2 × 10

),
D
0
is the diffusion coefficient of O
2
in 0.1 M KOH (1.9 × 10

s
−1
) and
V
is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01 cm
2
s
−1
). The accelerated durability tests of Cu-SAs/N-C and Pt/C were performed by applying potential cycling between 1.0 and 0.6 V versus RHE for 5,000 cycles (O
2
-saturated 0.1 M KOH, 50 mv s
−1
, room temperature).
For the RRDE tests, the disk electrode was scanned negatively (10 mV s
−1
). Meanwhile, a high potential (1.20 V versus RHE) was applied on the ring electrode, leading to the electro-oxidation of H
2
O
2
, which occured during the oxygen reduction process. The hydrogen peroxide yield (H
2
O
2
(%)) and electron transfer number (
n
) were calculated based on the following equations:
$${\mathrm{H}}_2{\mathrm{O}}_2\,\left( {\mathrm{\% }} \right) = 200 \times \frac{{\frac{{{I}_{\mathrm{r}}}}{{N}}}}{{{I}_{\mathrm{d}} + \frac{{{I}_{\mathrm{r}}}}{{N}}}}$$
(4)
$${n} = 4 \times \frac{{{I}_{\mathrm{d}}}}{{{I}_{\mathrm{d}} + \frac{{{I}_{r}}}{{N}}}}$$
(5)
where
I
d
is the disk current,
I
r
is the ring current and
N
= 0.4 is the current collection efficiency of the platinum ring.
