Abstract
Brønsted acid sites on the oxide overlayers of metal–metal oxide inverse catalysts are often hypothesized to drive selective C–O bond activation. However, the Brønsted acid site nature and dynamics under working conditions remain poorly understood due to the functionalities of the constituent materials. Here we investigate the formation and the dynamics of Brønsted acid and redox sites on PtWO
x
/C under working conditions. Density functional theory-based thermodynamic calculations and microkinetic modelling reveal a complex interplay between Brønsted acid and redox sites and potentially fast catalyst dynamics at comparable timescales to the Brønsted acid catalysed dehydration chemistry. Combining in situ characterization and probe chemistry, we demonstrate that the density of Brønsted acid sites on the PtWO
x
/C inverse catalyst could be modulated by up to two orders of magnitude by altering the reaction parameters and by the chemistry itself. We elicit an order of magnitude increase in the acid-catalysed dehydration average reaction rate by periodic hydrogen pulsing.

and the ring-opening of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol

6
. These multifunctional catalysts consist of metal sites, redox sites and Brønsted and Lewis acid sites.
It has been suggested that the Brønsted acid sites activate the secondary C–O bond and stabilize the cationic intermediates towards the formation of diols from biomass-derived substrates such as glycerol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol
2
,

,
6
,
8
,
13
. Establishing structure–activity relationships is complicated by the intimate coupling of Brønsted acidity and catalyst reducibility. Specifically, in situ Brønsted acid formation is often accompanied by partial reduction of the oxide, leading to redox centres (vacancy formation)
14
. Such redox centres have been proposed to activate the primary hydroxyl groups in aromatic compounds
5
,
15
,
16
; others have attributed the activity to Brønsted acid sites on partially reduced WO
x
(ref.
14
). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the dynamics and coupling of acid and redox sites under various reaction environments. Aside from the ambiguity on the active sites of these materials, the active sites are taken to be stationary.
In this Article, we investigate Brønsted acid site dynamics on the core–shell metal/metal oxide PtWO
x
/C inverse catalyst as a case study. The catalyst is synthesized by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, microkinetic modelling (MKM) and experimental kinetics with probe molecules, we elucidate the structure of the WO
x
overlayer, the catalyst phase behaviour and the dynamics of the acid sites under various working conditions. Unlike the metal and the oxide that are not acidic under our conditions, we demonstrate Brønsted acid catalysis by the synergy of the elements and identify water dissociation, hydrogen spillover and oxide reduction as crucial contributors to the dynamics and density of Brønsted acid sites, leading to profound changes in the dehydration rate of probe reactions. While the acidity of these materials can be strong compared to microporous aluminosilicate zeolites, their site density is modulated by the chemistry, the operating conditions, the catalyst pretreatment and the longitudinal position in a reactor. The fundamental insights provide methods for modulating the sites in the selective C–O bond activation paving numerous routes to catalyst design. Using the dehydration of
tert
-butanol as a case study, we demonstrate that periodic pulsing of hydrogen allows the PtWO
x
/C catalyst to achieve alternate states with about one order of magnitude higher activity than under constant hydrogen feed.

Morphology, coordination and oxidation state of WO

Establishing a representative structural model is important. Although tetrahedral WO
x
clusters on various oxide surfaces have been reported
5
, the structure of WO
x
on noble metals under reductive conditions has not been explored. We investigated three structural models: a monolayer on Pt(111) with W atoms coordinating to five oxygen atoms (Fig.
1a
), as previously reported
17
; a tetrahedral W

cluster with two terminal W centres and a bridge W centre

shows simulated X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra (W L

3
O
9
cluster model shows an intense pre-edge feature, characteristic of tetrahedral W(VI) centres—this feature is absent from the monolayer model
18
,
19
. Our experimental W L

XANES spectra display a similar intense pre-edge feature at 12,095 eV for PtWO
x
/C-1R and a smaller pre-edge peak for WO
x
/C-1R and WO
3
(Fig.
1e
), indicating more tetrahedrally coordinated W centres on Pt than on carbon or a bulk oxide. The smaller pre-edge peak is attributed to the distorted octahedral W centres. Reducing the W(VI) trimer to a W(IV) trimer decreases the calculated pre-edge feature, also seen in the experimental spectrum of the reduced PtWO
x
/C-1R (Fig.
1e
). The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization
6
and the XANES spectra suggest a sub-monolayer of WO
x
. Thereby, we conclude that the WO

overlayer in PtWO

Formation mechanisms of Brønsted acid sites
We have examined three formation mechanisms of Brønsted acid sites on the PtWO
x
catalyst, including H
2
dissociation on Pt followed by H diffusion and attachment to a terminal or bridge O of the WO
x
cluster (hereinafter referred to as the spillover mechanism), direct H
2
dissociation on WO
x
and direct H
2
O dissociation on WO
x
. The dissociative adsorption of H
2
on Pt has an enthalpy change of −0.95 eV and is non-activated. Upon dissociation, H diffusion from Pt onto the W
3
O
9
cluster and formation of an acidic terminal hydroxyl group (Supplementary Fig.
2a
) has an activation barrier of 0.15 eV and releases 0.08 eV of enthalpy (driving force for spillover). Various terminal sites for the OH group have been investigated; two examples are shown in Supplementary Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Fig.
3b
. Bridging W–OH–W sites (Supplementary Fig.
3c
) are energetically less favoured than terminal ones by 1.10 eV. The direct H
2
dissociation on the WO
3
monolayer has a prohibitively high barrier of 1.97 eV (transition state shown in Supplementary Fig.
2b
), consistent with experimental reports that hydrogen activation over WO
x
–C and WO
x
–ZrO
2
catalysts requires temperatures over 200 °C (refs.
6
,
20
). The transition state for proton formation by dissociative water adsorption is shown in Supplementary Fig.
2c
. The reaction is exothermic by −0.10 eV and requires only 0.27 eV of activation. H
2
O dissociation creates a proton on a terminal O site and a hydroxyl on a W site (the bridging OH is not energetically favoured).
Pt-assisted self-inhibited catalyst dynamics
Figure
2a
illustrates pathways encountered in the inverse-catalyst dynamics under various working conditions. As we show below, the extent of these surface reactions governs the active site densities. The facile Pt-assisted reduction of WO
3
on several oxides below 400 °C was demonstrated using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
21
,
22
. By contrast, bulk WO
3
(without Pt) remains fully oxidized at the same conditions
23
. Figure

trimer, including H

reduction, the reverse WO

hydration and the first-principles predicted energy profile of the cycle. Pt activates H
2
and protonates W
3
O
x
(Supplementary Fig.
4
). Additional H spillover can reduce W
3
O
x
by H
2
O elimination (Supplementary Fig.
5
), forming an oxygen vacancy. The reduction of W
3
O
9
to W
3
O
8
is thermodynamically downhill and requires minor activation (0.3 eV). The reverse process of W
3
O
8
oxidation entails H
2
O adsorption followed by the notably activated H
2
O dissociation (0.93 eV). In summary, catalyst re-oxidation is energetically harder than reduction.

is −0.08 eV; for the protonation of W

9
H
2
to W
3
O
9
H
3
it is 0.43 eV (reactions 64 and 67, respectively, Supplementary Table
1
). This trend holds for reduced clusters as well. For example, protonation of W
3
O
5
by H spillover becomes endothermic (reaction 5, Supplementary Table
1
); H prefers binding to Pt rather than W
3
O
5
. As a result, and depending on conditions, not all terminal oxygens are protonated. The protonation slows down as it proceeds, that is, it is self-inhibited.
In summary, H spillover first protonates the terminal oxygens of the catalyst and eventually eliminates them in the form of water, creating redox centres, whereas water hydroxylates and re-oxidizes the catalyst. Interestingly, the protonation and reduction are self-inhibited; WO
x
does not become either fully reduced or fully protonated. Instead, it dynamically responds to the reaction conditions, controlling site identity and density, as discussed below. The protonation, reduction and oxidation kinetics depend on the degree of catalyst protonation and oxidation.
Phase diagram and dynamic behaviour
To examine the active sites under working conditions, we calculated the ab initio phase diagram (Fig.
2c
). In the absence of hydrogen, W
3
O
9
remains oxidized (the black region in Fig.
2c
) and does not possess either Brønsted acid or redox sites. With increasing hydrogen pressure, the catalyst is first partially reduced to W
3
O
7
H
1
over a broad temperature range, then protonated to W
3
O
7
H
3
at low temperatures or reduced to W
3
O
5
at high temperatures with a concomitant decrease in Brønsted acid density (Fig.
2d
) and an increase in redox centre density (Fig.
2e
). The degree of protonation and reduction is consistent with the DFT energy profiles (Fig.
2b
).
To unravel the catalyst dynamics, we built a discrete state-based microkinetic model
24
to simulate the catalyst state when it is exposed to different conditions. When the catalyst is not trapped in a metastable state, the long-time kinetic behaviour (Fig.
3a
) coincides with the thermodynamic behaviour, as happens here (Fig.
2c
). High H
2
O partial pressure leads to more Brønsted acid sites at high temperatures because equilibrium favours the dissociative adsorption of H
2
O (Supplementary Fig.
7
).

Figure
3a
shows the predicted predominant catalyst state as a function of time when the catalyst is exposed to different environments starting from the fully oxidized state, W
3
O
9
. At lower temperatures, Brønsted acid sites form quickly by hydrogen spillover and mild reduction occurs below 140 °C. Further catalyst reduction occurs slowly at 150–200 °C and accelerates above 200 °C, due to the higher energy barriers for the reduction of W
3
O
7
H
1
to W
3
O
5
. This analysis has several implications. First, the in situ formation of Brønsted acid sites is rapid. Second, a gradual increase in redox site density at the expense of Brønsted acidity is anticipated at 140–250 °C. Third, above 250 °C, a swift reduction of WO
3
leads to a significant loss of Brønsted acidity.
Expectedly, the kinetic behaviour varies with the initial catalyst state. Figure
3b
depicts the dynamics starting from a reduced state, W
3
O
5
. Unlike W
3
O
9
, which suffers rapid reduction under high H
2
partial pressure, W
3
O
5
undergoes reduction at a slower rate. First, the W
3
O
5
domain is replaced with W
3
O
7
H
1
at 120–250 °C; below 120 °C the catalyst is oxidized to W
3
O
7
H
3
after 1,000 s. Up to this point, the kinetic catalyst state agrees with the thermodynamic one except when no H
2
is present. It takes 10
6
s to overcome the kinetic barriers and fully oxidize W
3
O
8
H
x
to W
3
O
9
. A slightly reduced catalyst would not become fully oxidized at relevant timescales.
To better understand the catalyst dynamics upon exposure to H
2
and H
2
O, we plot the time-dependent Brønsted acid site density and oxidation state at three temperatures (Fig.
4
). Upon exposure to H
2
, the Brønsted acid density increases rapidly at short times owing to fast H spillover from Pt. Consistent with the phase diagram, the maximum Brønsted acid density is anticorrelated with temperature. Interestingly, after reaching a maximum, the Brønsted acid site density decreases due to the partial reduction of WO
x
(Fig.
4b
). When H
2
is turned off, the Brønsted acid site density decreases sharply at first and then gradually at lower temperatures (<125 °C). By contrast, at 175 °C, the Brønsted acid site density first increases, owing to the re-oxidation of the redox centres by H
2
O and eventually decreases via backward H spillover to Pt and H
2
desorption. Overall, the complex dynamic catalyst behaviour is found to be controlled by rapidly forming Brønsted acid sites, slower catalyst reduction by H
2
and even slower re-oxidation by H
2
O. As the amounts of H
2
and H
2
O change along the reactor, as well as with time and temperature, the catalyst protonation and oxidation state will change dynamically. Clearly, a static picture of acidity does not hold for these materials.

In situ catalyst characterization under reducing conditions
To assess the computational predictions, we investigated the stability and the electronic state of PtWO
x
/C-1R at various reduction temperatures and hydrogen partial pressures. CO chemisorption reveals that roughly 32% of the Pt surface is covered by WO
x
clusters (Supplementary Note
1
) and most of those clusters remain on Pt after reduction and annealing treatments at 400 °C. The W L
3
edge energy of PtWO
x
/C-1R is 10,209.8 eV (Fig.
5a
), close to that of WO
3
(10,209.4 eV). Mild reduction at 250 °C with 0.1 bar of H
2
leads to a white line intensity decrease and a slight edge energy reduction (0.2 eV), suggesting a W(VI) oxidation state (Fig.
5a
). Reduction at 400 °C further reduces WO
x
to a state between 4+ and 5+, estimated based on the W L
3
edge energy (Supplementary Fig.
10
). By contrast, WO
x
/C-1R is not reduced (Supplementary Fig.
11
). XANES at the Pt L
2
edge indicates a readily reduced Pt/C to metal at 250 °C and a slightly oxidized Pt on PtWO
x
/C-1R even at 400 °C, as indicated by the somewhat higher white line peak at 13,276.5 eV (Supplementary Fig.
12
). The results suggest charge transfer from Pt to the WO
x
overlayer with a stable, partially reduced WO
x
overlayer. Experimental results are qualitatively consistent with model predictions (Fig.
2c,e
).

In situ XPS was also conducted over WO

/C-1R, PtWO

/C-1R and 10%PtWO

/C-15R. Due to the high WO
x
loading of 10%PtWO
x
/C-15R, its W 4
f
signal was much stronger than that of PtWO
x
/C-1R, allowing a reliable fit of the spectra. Before reduction, all catalysts were treated under reduced pressure at 250 °C. At 250 °C, WO
x
/C-1R undergoes minimal changes (Fig.
5b
), whereas W(V) of 10%PtWO
x
/C-15R increases slightly (Fig.
5c
). At 400 °C, W(VI) doublets of the WO
x
/C-1R still dominate; by contrast, the W(V) doublet contribution of the 10%PtWO
x
/C-15R increases significantly. The spectrum of PtWO
x
/C-1R resembles that of 10%PtWO
x
/C-15R (Supplementary Fig.
13
). Noble-metal-promoted reduction of WO
x
to partially reduced 5+ and 4+ states above 400 °C was reported previously
25
,
26
and is supported by TPR results (Supplementary Fig.
14
). XPS results are qualitatively consistent with the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data and demonstrate the importance of Pt in modulating the oxidation state of the WO
x
overlayer by facilitating partial reduction only.
Exposing the dynamics of acidity using alcohol dehydration
We have used the dehydration of 2-propanol to correlate the catalyst state with activity. All samples were pre-reduced at 250 °C for 1 h to remove any PtO
x
. Over the metallic sites of Pt/C, 2-propanol undergoes almost exclusively dehydrogenation to produce acetone (Fig.
6a,b
), consistent with previous work
10
. Pt and C show negligible dehydration activity. On the other hand, WO
x
dehydrates 2-propanol to propene (Fig.
6b
). PtWO
x
/C-1R exposes multifunctional behaviour: WO
x
Brønsted acid sites dehydrate 2-propanol; Pt dehydrogenates 2-propanol to acetone and H
2
and subsequently hydrogenates propene—with the produced H
2
—to propane. The substantially lower dehydrogenation activity compared to Pt reveals a large fraction of Pt sites covered with WO
x
, in agreement with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) results (Supplementary Fig.
15

To eliminate the complication from the in situ
-
formed hydrogen (from 2-propanol dehydrogenation) causing online catalyst reduction, we investigated
tert
-butanol dehydration (Fig.
6a
). We compared the PtWO
x
/C-1R catalysts, reduced at 250 and 400 °C, with the untreated (fresh) catalyst. Figure
6c
depicts a monotonic decrease in dehydration rate with increasing reduction temperature by nearly eight times due to the reduction of W(VI) to W(V) and W(IV) (XANES data; Fig.
5a
) and the lowering of the Brønsted acid site density, consistent with the predicted phase behaviour (Fig.
2c
).
To disentangle the interplay of redox and Brønsted acid sites, we annealed the catalyst at 400 °C in a mixture of N
2
and He. The annealed catalyst is less active than the fresh one (Fig.
6d
), due to the loss of OHs by dehydration, but more active than the reduced catalyst. The surface OH groups are partially regenerated by steaming the annealed catalyst in 0.1 bar steam at 400 °C (grey square in Fig.
6d
). The initial dehydration activities of the pretreated catalysts (Fig.
6d
) are in satisfactory agreement with the Brønsted acid site densities measured by reactive gas chromatography with
tert
-butylamine (Supplementary Fig.
16
). For PtWO
x
/C-1R, this acid quantification technique is preferred over Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine because of the low Brønsted acid site density of PtWO
x
/C-1R and the strong absorption of infrared by the carbon support. The adsorbed pyridine cannot be observed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy even after a tenfold dilution with KBr (Supplementary Fig.
17
). On the other hand, reactive gas chromatography is not affected by the opacity of the support, is Brønsted acid site specific and is capable of measuring Brønsted acid site density below 1 µmol H
+
g
catalyst
−1
(ref.
27
).
Water co-feed experiments (Fig.
6d
) over the annealed catalyst at 140 °C indicate, counterintuitively, an increased initial dehydration rate, despite water product enhancing the reverse, equilibrium-limited dehydration reaction. The lack of an induction period suggests that water rapidly hydroxylates the WO
x
and regenerates OHs (Supplementary Fig.
18
). Increasing the steam partial pressure from 0.05 to 0.15 bar slightly decreases the initial dehydration activity due to either the competitive adsorption of water on the active sites or the reverse reaction. The inhibiting effect of steam is also illustrated by its removal after 8 h on stream (Supplementary Fig.
18
).
The in situ formation of Brønsted acid sites by co-feeding hydrogen is illustrated in Fig.
6e
. While catalyst reduction adversely affects the activity, on the fresh catalyst, hydrogen generates Brønsted acid sites; its partial pressure correlates positively with the dehydration activity (Fig.
6e
). On the annealed catalyst, hydrogen increases the initial rate threefold (Fig.
6f
). By contrast, although annealed WO
x
/C-1R shows comparable dehydration activity (Supplementary Fig.
19
), hydrogen exposure has no promotional effect, confirming the pivotal role of Pt in forming Brønsted acid sites by hydrogen spillover. The reduced catalyst (Fig.
6f
) shows distinct dynamic behaviour under different environments. In hydrogen, Brønsted acid sites form at short times, but the catalyst is gradually reduced at longer times and becomes inactive when the hydrogen is turned off after 8 h (Supplementary Fig.
20
). Without hydrogen, the catalyst is initially less active but becomes more active with time on stream due to the in situ generated water via the reverse pathway shown in Fig.
2b
. These dynamic changes occur at longer timescales of hours.
Tuning activity by periodic pulsing of H
2
The fundamental insights from pretreatment and co-feed studies are consistent with the dynamic behaviour of the WO
x
overlayer depicted in Fig.
2b
and Fig.
3
. Water hydroxylates the oxide and generates Brønsted acid sites, slowly oxidizes the reduced WO
x
overlayer at 140 °C and retards the dehydration reaction by promoting its reverse. Hydrogen generates Brønsted acid sites by spillover at shorter times but slowly reduces the catalyst at longer reaction times. This dynamic behaviour of WO
x
can be leveraged to increase the reaction rate by pulsing hydrogen (Fig.
7a
).

Figure

shows time-on-stream data for the reduced PtWO
x
/C-1R. After an initial increase in the rate when exposed to hydrogen, the catalyst is deactivated in the first 2 h. When the hydrogen is switched off after 2 h, the activity of the catalyst decreases immediately but gradually increases due to re-oxidization by the in situ formed water. Since the oxidized WO
x
overlayer can sustain a higher Brønsted acid density from hydrogen spillover, the dehydration activity substantially increases when H
2
is re-introduced after 4 h. This trend repeats itself. Periodic hydrogen pulsing allows the catalyst to reach alternate states with a much higher acid site density that cannot be sustained at steady state. The average dehydration rate over the last 4 h is more than 8 times higher than that with constant co-fed hydrogen (Fig.
7c
). One may expect more than one order of magnitude increase in catalyst activity upon optimizing the frequency of periodic pulsing.

, but their active sites and dynamics have remained elusive. While catalyst reduction by H
2
is typical, in many of these reactions, hydrogen and water are reactants and/or products and alter the mode of action of the catalyst. Computational modelling, in situ catalyst characterization and dehydration probe reactions reveal a complex interplay of water dissociation, hydrogen spillover and catalyst reduction in controlling the Brønsted acid and redox site density of PtWO
x
/C-1R, a prototypical inverse catalyst. The time-scales of various elementary steps are quite different, giving rise to complex dynamic behaviour with time-on-stream or location in a chemical reactor. Brønsted acid sites on PtWO
x
/C-1R are more active than the acid sites in microporous materials such as zeolites (Supplementary Fig.
21
). Different from typical Brønsted acid catalysts with localized protons near the oxygens adjacent to the metal atoms with charge imbalance, whose site density is constant, the site density here changes with reaction conditions and location in a reactor. Excitingly, the chemistry itself can regulate the active sites and change the rate and selectivity for various pathways.
Unlike hydrogen or other reducing agents, in situ generated water or steaming creates Brønsted acid sites on the WO
x
overlayer by direct, modestly activated dissociation without lowering the oxidation state of W, as revealed by XPS (Supplementary Fig.
22
). Water can also slowly re-oxidize the catalyst, forming W–OH centres and thus increasing the acid density. Finally, it inhibits dehydration by promoting its backward reaction. Although direct hydrogen dissociative adsorption on WO
x
is unfavourable below 400 °C, Pt readily dissociates H
2
and facilitates the rapid formation of Brønsted acid sites by spillover. It can also dehydrogenate a substrate and form hydrogen in situ. Pt stabilizes the WO
x
overlayer inverse structure, by allowing partial but not complete reduction due to self-inhibition and enables charge transfer to WO
x
even at 400 °C, as shown by the EDX (ref.
6
) and Pt L
2
XANES spectra (Supplementary Fig.
12b
). Finally, hydrogen enables a slower reduction of WO
x
that increases the density of redox centres and decreases the Brønsted acid site density.
The temperature has a dominant effect on the distribution of active sites. The in situ XANES (Fig.
5a
) and reduction studies (Fig.
6c
) show that reducing the catalyst at high temperatures lowers the oxidation state to W(V) and W(IV), preventing the generation of Brønsted acid sites by hydrogen spillover. High-temperature annealing in an inert atmosphere facilitates surface dehydroxylation, lowering the Brønsted acid density again without significantly reducing the oxide. At low temperatures, hydrogen spillover and hydroxylation by water (Fig.
3d
) significantly increase the number of Brønsted acid sites due to low energy barriers without significantly changing the oxidation state.
At intermediate temperatures, slow reduction of PtWO
x
not only causes loss of protons but also lowers the activity of WO
x
by cleaving the W=O bond, which is essential for stabilizing and delocalizing the charge-compensating electron
28
. This slow reduction is observed using a time-dependent XANES study (Supplementary Note
2
). The state of MO
x
can easily be tuned by changing the ratio of metal to the metal oxide
21
,
29
,
30
, the dispersion of M, the surface density of MO
x
(refs.
22
,
31
), the distance between M and MO (Supplementary Note
2
), the support reducibility, the reaction temperature and the hydrogen pressure. In situ XPS characterization (Supplementary Fig.
24
) shows that reducible metal oxides, such as WO
x
, can easily be re-oxidized in air to restore the Brønsted acidity.
The preferred Brønsted acid site formation pathway depends on operating conditions, such as the hydrogen and water partial pressures and the WO
x
coverage on Pt. As the coverage of WO
x
approaches one monolayer, Brønsted acid sites could form by water dissociation only, as the hydrogen dissociation will be hindered by unavailable Pt sites and its high activation energy barrier on the WO
x
overlayer. Our study demonstrates that the Brønsted acid site density can significantly be modulated by changing the pretreatment conditions (temperature, hydrogen pressure, steam pressure) and by periodic hydrogen pulsing, leading to a significant activity increase. The idea could in principle be extended to other biomass reactions producing high-value terminal diols and aromatics, where acid sites have been proposed to play a crucial role. The fundamental insights from this study could enable the development of more efficient inverse catalysts. While these catalysts are far from static and are inherently complex, simple ab initio thermodynamic and microkinetic models in conjunction with probe reactions and characterization form a blueprint for understanding and manipulating the Brønsted versus redox properties of the catalyst and the underlying chemistry.
Methods
DFT calculations
Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using VASP (ref.
32
). Exchange and correlation effects were approximated with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation energy functional
33
and the core electrons were calculated using the projector augmented wavefunction. For the W
x
O
y
cluster/Pt(111), we put a W
3
O
x
cluster on Pt(111) slabs of 4 layers. In order to eliminate periodic image interactions, we used a big Pt(111) slab (5 × 4) to support one trimer. For the (WO
3
)
n
monolayer/Pt (111), we used a (4 × 2) Pt(111) slab to support the (WO
3
)
4
2D monolayer structure (Fig.
1a
). For each calculation, the bottom two layers of the Pt slab were fixed at the bulk position while the top two layers with the supported oxide cluster and adsorbates were fully relaxed. We applied a Monkhorst–Pack mesh
34
. The
k
-points were (3 × 2 × 1) and (2 × 4 × 1) for the 5 × 4 slabs and the monolayer supercells, respectively. Transition state searches were carried out using the climbing-image VTST NEB method
35
. For geometry optimization calculations, the cut-off energy was set to 520 eV and the energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10
−5
eV and 0.01 eV Å
−1
, respectively. In the NEB calculations, the force criterion was set to 0.025 eV Å
−1
. We used pMuTT (ref.
36
), together with the DFT-calculated reaction energies and vibrational frequencies, to simulate a phase diagram.
Simulated phase diagrams
Thermodynamic phase diagrams were generated using the PhaseDiagram function in pMuTT (ref.

State-based MKM

was performed using the CHEMKIN package. A batch reactor was chosen to study the reduction kinetics of WO
x
/Pt using H
2
/H
2
O mixed gas at different temperatures. Two sites were considered in this model: the Pt(111) site and the WO
x
site. The Pt site is responsible for H
2
activation, while the tungsten oxides can be hydrogenated and hydrated to generate hydroxyl groups. H-spillover from Pt to WO
x
sites can also reduce the oxide by forming H
2
O. Due to the huge set of structures of all possible hydrogenated/hydrated tungsten oxides, we did not calculate all activation energies in the reaction network using DFT. Instead, we estimated them using Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationships developed herein from a smaller subset of DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig.
25
). To keep the chemical potential of H
2
and H
2
O constant during the reaction, we chose a small surface area to volume ratio of 10
−20
cm
−1
for the batch reactor. For the calculations starting with fully oxidized W
3
O
9
clusters, the reaction time for every condition in MKM was set to 36,000 s. For the re-oxidation of W
3
O
5
clusters, the MKM reaction times were set to 10
6
s. The Brønsted acid density heatmaps were generated by calculating the OH group coverages at each reaction condition at long times. The heatmaps were smoothed by interpolation.
XANES simulation
XANES simulation of W atoms was carried out using FDMNES (refs.
37
,
38
), where the convoluted L
1
edge spectra of all W atoms in each supercell were calculated using the muffin-tin approximation with a radius of 4.0 Å. To account for broadening effects (for example, core–hole lifetime), a Lorentzian energy-dependent convolution was applied to the calculated spectrum. The energy range was set to −20 to 80 eV relative to the Fermi level. The simulated spectra were aligned with the experimental spectra of W standards (WO
3
and WO
2
) using the first inflection point.
Catalyst synthesis

, Vulcan XC-72R) was added to the solution and it was kept at room temperature for 12 h. After drying the catalyst in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h, the resulting powder was reduced in a 7-mm-inner diameter quartz tube with 60 ml min

vapour was then introduced to approximately 0.3 g catalyst, which was evacuated and held at 200 °C before the deposition, for 1.5 min. Next, the catalyst chamber was evacuated for 5 min to remove excess precursors. The catalyst was then exposed to air for 6 min to oxidize the adsorbed W(CO)
6
precursor. After completing all ALD cycles, the catalyst was treated twice by rapid thermal annealing (400 °C, 1 min) to ensure the complete removal of ligands. Samples prepared using

The carbon black samples, used as the reference for reaction and characterization, were prepared similarly by impregnation without salts, reduction and finally rapid thermal annealing. The actual Pt and W loadings were determined using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (PerkinElmer, Optima 5300V) by Galbraith Laboratories.
Kinetics experiments
Kinetics experiments were performed using a fixed-bed reactor at near ambient pressure. The reactor was a quartz tube placed in the middle of a resistance furnace. For a typical experiment, the catalyst bed was fixed between two inert quartz beds. The catalyst bed was placed in the constant temperature zone of the furnace to minimize the axial temperature gradient. The temperature of the catalyst bed was measured using a thermocouple covered by a quartz sleeve. Three mass flow controllers were used to feed a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen and helium at specified ratios. The typical flow rate of the gas mixture was 100 ml min
−1
at room temperature.
The alcohol flow rate was adjusted by controlling the temperature of the bubbler and the flow rates of the carrier gas (nitrogen, 99.999% purity) and the balance gas (helium, 99.999% purity). All the pipelines containing alcohol and water were heated to above 150 °C to avoid condensation. The reactor outlet was connected to a gas chromatograph (Agilent, 7890A) equipped with a Plot-Q column and a flame ionization detector. For a typical experiment, the catalyst was pre-reduced with a 100 ml min
−1
H
2
–He mixture (10% H
2
) at 250 °C for 1 h with a ramping rate of 10 °C min
−1
. The reactor was then purged with He for 1 h before the reaction.
In situ XAS
XAS measurements were performed on beamline 5BM-D at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Spectra collected in transmission mode were recorded using ionization chambers. Samples were pressed into pellets and loaded into a three-well sample holder. The sample holder was then placed in a tubular reactor with two Kapton windows at the ends for in situ reduction studies. After purging the reactor with a flowing hydrogen–helium mixture (10% hydrogen) and acquiring the spectra of the fresh samples, the reactor was heated to the desired reduction temperature. The XAS spectra of the reduced samples were collected in situ at the desired reduction temperatures under a flowing hydrogen–helium mixture after 1 h reduction. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were recorded at the W L

edge and Pt L
2
edge and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were recorded at the W L
3
edge. The XAS spectra of PtWO
x
/C-1R were also collected before and after reduction at 250 °C in fluorescence mode. The measurements were performed using a Linkam cell and a Vortex-ME4 silicon drift detector. The time-dependent XANES spectra for PtWO
x
/C-1R at W L
1
and W L
3
edges were recorded on the Quick X-ray Absorption and Scattering (QAS) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) II, Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Fluorescence spectra were measured using a passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector. The spectra of reference foils were measured using ionization chambers. XAS data processing was performed using the Athena (0.9.26) program following standard procedures
40
. The first maximum of the first derivative of the raw XAS data was selected to be the edge energy.
In situ XPS
The near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) experiments were performed at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Catalyst samples were scanned with a laboratory-based spectrometer (Phoibos NAP 150, SPECS Surface Nano Analysis). The instrument was equipped with a monochromated Al Kα (1,486.6 eV) photon source and a differentially pumped hemispherical analyser (SPECS Phoibos). Each powder sample was pressed to a cleaned thin Cu foil and transferred into the main chamber. Pt 4

spectra were collected during all procedures. Each sample was heated to 250 °C under reduced pressure for 1 h to remove adsorbed surface species. During in situ reduction and the following oxidation studies, hydrogen or oxygen were introduced into the main chamber through a variable leak valve. The pressure of the main chamber was maintained at 0.5 mbar. XPS data analysis was performed using CasaXPS version 2.3.23. The peak model parameters are shown in Supplementary Table

Brønsted acid site quantification
The Brønsted acid site density of PtWO
x
/C-1R was measured under different gaseous environments using reactive gas chromatography
27
, equipped with H
2
or He to simulate reducing or annealing treatment environments, respectively. Initially, 20 mg of catalyst was sandwiched between two plugs of deactivated glass wool (Restek, 24324) and placed within a quartz inlet liner (Agilent, 5062-3587). The catalyst-containing liner was placed in the inlet of a gas chromatograph (Agilent, 7890B) equipped with an HP-PlotQ column (Agilent, 19091P-Q04) and a flame ionization detector. Unless otherwise noted, the catalyst was pre-treated in situ at 400 °C under a flow of H
2
, pure He or 10% H
2
O/He mixture to reduce, anneal or steam the catalyst, respectively. The pre-treated catalyst was then saturated at 140 °C with 10 consecutive 1 µl pulses of
tert
-butylamine, delivered at a rate of 1 µl min
−1
using an automated liquid sampler. The saturated catalyst was then purged in 1,000 sccm of He to remove any weakly bound
tert
-butylamine. The catalyst temperature was then ramped up to 400 °C at 10 °C min
−1
and held for 30 min, with the chromatography column held at 30 °C to trap desorbing butenes resulting from the Hofmann elimination of
tert
-butylamine adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites. The temperature of the chromatography column was then ramped to 270 °C eluting any trapped isobutene which was then quantified and taken as a direct measure of the Brønsted acid site density.
