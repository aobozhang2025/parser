Abstract
Atomically thin two-dimensional alloys are interesting for electrocatalysis but suffer from poor functional robustness and wide active-site heterogeneity. Here the synthesis of an unconventional hexagonal close-packed-phase intermetallic Pd-based multi-metallene, on which isolated Ru–O
3
atomic sites are homogeneously dispersed, overcomes these obstacles. This structure exhibits excellent hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity, durability and anti-CO poisoning performance. The mass activity and exchange current density reach 11.5 mA μg
−1
and 1.0 mA cm
−2
, respectively, showing some of the fastest reaction kinetics reported for Pd-based HOR catalysts. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical investigations confirm that the intensified ligand effect derived from orderly atomic arrangement tends to strengthen the adsorption of hydroxyl and water, while the homogeneous Ru–O
3
sites contribute to weakened binding of HOR-involved intermediates (
*
H,
*
OH and
*
H
2
O), leading to a favourable reaction pathway. This work demonstrates the importance of high-valence Ru and surface O species in enhancing the synergetic process and water reorganization.

Addressing the sluggish kinetics of the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) to realize worthwhile intrinsic catalytic activity is necessary in improving state-of-the-art anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs)
1

. Subject to over-strong hydrogen binding energy (HBE), especially under an alkaline environment, platinum group metals (PGMs) suffer from an unfavourable desorption process and have a high energy barrier in the Volmer step

5
. Introducing oxyphilic alloying elements to either modulate the electronic structure of host PGMs (refs.

has proved effective in stimulating smooth hydrogen detachment, accelerating the reaction kinetics. However, most current HOR catalysts lack sufficient capacity to provide multi-catalytic sites for reconciling the binding energy of hydrogen and hydroxyl species. In addition, they do not take interfacial water reorganization energy into consideration
11
and therefore fail to achieve promising catalytic behaviours.
Endowed with ultrathin two-dimensional scale-induced high surface area, the ligand effect and inherent lattice strain as well as the quantum size effect, emerging metallene materials exhibit an extraordinary ability for electronic structure regulation to achieve outstanding intrinsic activity
12
,
13
,
14
. Unfortunately, they are constrained by inferior stability derived from foreign element leaching and mechanism ambiguity caused by non-uniformity of active sites. Constructing orderly atomic arrangements not only helps increase the catalytic stability, but also provides homogeneous isolated active sites, presenting greater capability to influence the
d
-band centre
15
,
16
,
17
. Given the ideal potential of ruthenium (Ru) to balance the binding energy between hydrogen and hydroxyl
18
,
19
, precisely controlling the distribution and coordination configuration of identical Ru-based active sites serves as an attractive topic for HOR (refs.
20
,
21
,
22
). Nonetheless, precise synthesis of such intermetallic metallene materials with multiple active sites including a tailored single-type Ru moiety is challenging.
In this Article, we realize uniform distribution of Ru atoms on the surface of a Pd-based metallene material via a Pt-induced auto-catalysis deposition method. The as-obtained penta-metallene (PMene-Ru
0.18
) exhibits the unconventional metastable hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting verifies that surface Ru atoms have an isolated Ru–O
3
coordination environment, which serves as the key promotor for HOR performance. As a result, PMene-Ru
0.18
presents a high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and fast HOR kinetics, with a mass activity of 11.5 mA μg
−1
(
j
k, m
) and an exchange current density of 1.0 mA cm
−2
(
j
0, s
), surpassing Pt/C by 32.5 and 5.2 times, respectively. It also shows excellent stability and anti-CO poisoning performance. In situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further show that the origin of the HOR kinetics is derived from two-tier adsorption tunings: the hcp intermetallics induces reinforced hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) and water binding energy (H
2
OBE) while Ru–O
3
sites contribute to weakened adsorption of all the relative intermediates. This work highlights an intermetallic multi-element metallene material that balances the binding energy of all-round intermediates and offers a platform to study the role of the oxyphilic Ru moiety in an alkaline HOR.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
A PdIr metallene, with a downshifted
d
-band and weakened HBE relative to those of crude Pd and Ir, was chosen as the model catalyst in this study
23
,
24
. Unfortunately, impeded by the large diffusion resistance caused by Ir atoms, successful alloying of exotic Ru was found to be difficult even under a CO atmosphere at 220 °C (Supplementary Fig.
1a
). Additional Pt precursor was applied to realize the introduction and enrichment of Ru on the surface of the metallene, since Pt is reported to induce under-temperature reduction of mononuclear noble metal acetylacetonates through the auto-catalytic effect
25
(Supplementary Fig.
1b
). We find that a PdIr bimetallene (BMene) is obtained without Pt precursor, regardless of the addition of Ru or Mo precursors. By contrast, after introducing proper amounts of Pt(acac)
2
, Mo and Ru atoms can be introduced through the galvanic-like auto-catalytic reaction to give a quaternary PdIrMoPt metallene (QMene) and a pentabasic PdIrRuMoPt metallene (PMene) (
Methods
and Supplementary Fig.
1c
).
High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, Fig.
1a
) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Supplementary Fig.
2a,b
) images of PMene-Ru
0.18
confirm its uniform hexagonal morphology and ~35 nm average diameter. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
2c,d
) measurement of PMene-Ru
0.18
verifies its sub-nano thickness to be approximately 0.9 nm. Such ultrathin thickness is further proved by its side-view TEM and HAADF-STEM images, with typically 4–5 atomic layers and preferential crystallographic orientation along the close-packed planes (Supplementary Figs.
3
and
4
). High-resolution HAADF-STEM images of PMene-Ru
0.18
(Fig.
1c
, Supplementary Fig.
5a,b,d,e,g,h
and Supplementary Fig.
7a
) show that it has a prominent hcp-type atomic arrangement with obvious heavy element enrichment on the edge of the metallene measured to be classic face-centred cubic (fcc)-{220} facets. Combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
6
) mappings, the existence of marginal Ir skin and uniform distribution of multiple elements throughout the metallene can be deduced. The composition of PMene-Ru
0.18
was further found to be Pd:Ir:Ru:Mo:Pt = 46:18:18:14:4 using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) (Supplementary Fig.
2e
and Supplementary Table
1
).

To gain insight into the structure of PMene-Ru
0.18
, the magnified HAADF-STEM image (Fig.
1e
) and corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT, Fig.
1f
and Supplementary Fig.
5c,f,i
) patterns were studied. A dominant alternating arrangement can be seen with bright heavier atoms occupying the vertex of the hexatomic ring wherein the dark lighter atoms are situated at the centre, implying an hcp intermetallic phase for PMene-Ru
0.18
. A
d
-spacing of 0.24 nm was measured for two adjacent heavy-atom columns (Supplementary Fig.
7a
), which is smaller than that for classic hcp structures. An apparent boundary separates the lattice into an fcc-{111}-exposed side and an hcp-{0001}-oriented interior body (Supplementary Fig.
7b–d
), a classic structure that can also be seen in other similar two-dimensional systems
26
,
27
. Despite the fcc-Ir shell, the FFT pattern of the whole individual metallene (Fig.
1f
) presents a typical hcp feature, with external reciprocal spots representing two groups of {210} and one group of {110} facets, while the extra inner ones index {100} and {1-10} planes. Consistent with the
d
-spacing measurement, the FFT pattern also indicates smaller interplanar spacings (~0.24 nm/~0.14 nm) for {100}&{1-10}/{210}&{110} facets than the standard hcp phase, for example 0.32 nm/0.22 nm for PtPb (JCPDS No. 06-0374), implying a contracted hcp lattice for PMene-Ru
0.18
. The packing density within the exposed facet was also calculated, indicating metal-level close-packed atomic distribution, which further verifies the unconventional hcp intermetallic phase of PMene-Ru
0.18
(Supplementary Fig.
8
). Additionally, substantial variation of atom positions can also be seen in Fig.
1e
as an obtuse rather than orthogonal angle emerges. This is attributed to the difference of atomic radii and complicated interaction among multiple elements. In short, these observations confirm the hcp intermetallic nature and the contracted lattice for PMene-Ru
0.18
.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of PMene-Ru
0.18
displays two characteristic peaks at 31.0 and 33.5° (Fig.
1g
). These are not consistent with any oxide impurities of Ru or Mo, suggesting a potential ordered structure within the metallene lattice, while a typical fcc alloy phase is seen for BMene (
Methods
, Supplementary Fig.
9a,b
and Supplementary Table
1
) and QMene (
Methods
, Supplementary Fig.
9c,d
and Supplementary Table
1
). To further examine the origin of these two peaks, an XRD simulation was performed to predict the possible occupation of each element (Supplementary Figs.
10
–
12
) and a hypothetical model of PMene-Ru
0.18
with a layered-ordered structure and preferential enrichment of Pd, Mo and Ru on the surface was determined (Fig.
1h
). A compressed unit cell was confirmed for PMene-Ru
0.18
with a typical hcp-type stacking sequence (Supplementary Table
2
), agreeing with the microscopy observation. Aberration corrected (AC)-TEM characterization and XRD simulation mutually demonstrate that PMene-Ru
0.18
possesses an unconventional hcp intermetallic structure with contracted lattices and a layered-ordered structure at the atomic level.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses were then carried out to investigate the electronic structure of PMene-Ru
0.18
. Compared with fresh Ru/C catalyst, carbon-supported PMene-Ru
0.18
exhibits a more positive binding energy and increased proportion of Ru
4+
(Fig.
2a
), implying a high valence of Ru. Accordingly, Pd mainly exists in the metallic state with gradually increasing binding energy, while Ir displays an opposite tendency (Supplementary Fig.
13
). X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of the Ru K edge show a higher edge energy for PMene-Ru
0.18
than for Ru foil (22,117 eV) and comparable 5
p
empty orbital density to RuO
2
(Fig.
2b
). This further implies that Ru atoms in PMene-Ru
0.18
present high oxidation states of +1.96 (inset of Fig.
2b
), in good agreement with the outcome of +1.83 estimated by the XPS integral area. This value is half of that in RuO
2
(IV).

Fitting was then performed with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data for both Ru K edge (Supplementary Fig.
14
and Supplementary Table
3
) and Pd K edge (Supplementary Fig.
15
and Supplementary Table
4
). The Fourier transform (FT)-EXAFS results suggest that only the trace Ru–Ru metallic bond can be detected for PMene-Ru
0.18
and the dominant existing form of Ru is the prolonged Ru–O pairs (Fig.
2c
). The Ru–O(–M) (M = other elements like Pd, Ir or Mo) bonds in PMene-Ru
0.18
were assessed to be 2.17 Å, much longer than the Ru–O(–Ru) bonds of ~1.96 Å in RuO
2
. Similar asymmetric and extended bonds can be seen for displacement of heteroatoms in oxide systems
28
,
29
. The coordination number (CN) of the Ru–O scattering path of PMene-Ru
0.18
was fitted to be ~3 (Supplementary Table
3
). This is half of that in RuO
2
and agrees well with the valence outcomes and prediction of the formation of a half oxidation layer comprising of uniform Ru–O
3
sites on the surface of PMene-Ru
0.18
, which is thin enough to allow H penetration and HOR catalysis
30
,
31
,
32
. The correlative wavelet transformation (WT)-EXAFS pattern of PMene-Ru
0.18
shows a centralized strong intensity region at short
R
range (1–2 Å), resembling neither metallic Ru foil nor completely oxidized RuO
2
, suggesting isolated properties of Ru–O
3
atomic sites (Fig.
2d
). By contrast, Pd in all three metallenes remains in the metallic state (Supplementary Fig.
16a
) and has similar tensile strain (Supplementary Fig.
16b–d
). The CN (Pd–Pd) also shows no reasonable trend in variation (Supplementary Fig.
16e
), therefore excluding the regulation of HOR activity through strain and CN effects.
XPS O 1
s
spectra were collected and differentiated to further validate the surface Ru–O coordination (Supplementary Table
5
)
33
,
34
,
35
. As shown in Fig.
2e
, all three metallenes hold a certain percentage of surface coordinated oxygen (M–O), which exhibits much higher O 1
s
binding energy than the reported values for lattice oxygen. In the wake of Ru introduction, the proportion of M–O for PMene-Ru
0.18
rises to 46.0% relative to that of QMene (36.0%). Given the reduction of Ir binding energy as well as the similar Mo content, this elevated ratio can be mainly ascribed to the newly formed Ru–O bonds. Moreover, the surface oxidation degree was also calculated here to verify the exclusive distribution of O species on the surface of PMene-Ru
0.18
, also providing evidence for the abundant formation of Ru–O
3
sites derived from partial surface oxidation (Supplementary Fig.
17
). In general, EXAFS fitting outcomes and XPS O 1
s
spectra collaboratively suggest the existence of isolated Ru–O
3
atomic sites in PMene-Ru
0.18
, which may be distributed on the surface of the metallene and participate in HOR catalysis.
XPS valence band (VB) spectra were then used to analyse the
d
-band structures for all three metallenes. Benefitting from the multiple ligand effects and the introduction of Ru–O
3
sites, PMene-Ru
0.18
has a downshifted
d
-band centre of −3.82 eV (Fig.
2f
), with an almost 0.5 and 0.3 eV shift compared with the corresponding pure metals (Supplementary Fig.
18
) and BMene/QMene samples, respectively. Such an obvious shift also relates to the reinforced electronic interaction due to the intermetallic structure. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests were then conducted to check their HBEs since the under potential deposition of hydrogen (H
upd
) peaks are indicators of hydrogen binding ability
7
,
36
. CVs of PMene-Ru
0.18
measured in 0.1 M KOH show that the H
upd
peak displays an apparent left shift (Fig.
2g
) to reach ~0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), in good agreement with the prediction of the
d
-band centre that PMene-Ru
0.18
possesses the most weakened HBE. The peak of Ru–
*
H adsorption usually occurs below 0.2 V versus RHE (Supplementary Fig.
19
)
37
. Hence, the as-measured signal may forecast the participation of other
*
H-adsorbed sites instead of Ru. CVs of PMene-Ru
0.18
in acid medium also support the same conclusion (Supplementary Fig.
20a
). CO-stripping experiments for PMene-Ru
0.18
show that both CO-oxidation peaks collected in acid and alkali commence and reach a maximum under a gradually left-shifted potential (Fig.
2h
and Supplementary Fig.
20b
), implying the most enhanced OHBE and the best detachment ability of CO for PMene-Ru
0.18
(ref.
6
).
Electrocatalytic performance towards alkaline HOR
The ECSAs of Pt/C and PtRu/C catalysts were determined to be 66.5 m
2
g
−1
and 66.3 m
2
g
−1
, respectively, by applying the H
upd
regions (Supplementary Fig.
21
). For metallenes, the underpotential deposition of copper (Cu
upd
) method was chosen considering the multi-element composition, where PMene-Ru
0.18
has an ECSA as high as 94.5 m
2
g
−1
(Supplementary Fig.
22
). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were then recorded in 0.1 M H
2
-saturated KOH solution from −0.1 to 0.6 V versus RHE (Fig.
3a
). All metallene catalysts show limiting diffusion current platforms with no obvious decay, unlike when metallic Ru serves as the primary active site (Supplementary Fig.
19e
)
38
,
39
,
40
,
41
. This indicates participation of PGMs as adsorption sites
42
and the non-metallic form of surface Ru for PMene-Ru
0.18
(refs.
43
,
44
). Compared with commercial catalysts and BMene/QMene samples, PMene-Ru
0.18
presents a more rapidly rising onset current co-controlled by diffusion and the reaction dynamics, implying its fast HOR kinetics. Mass-normalized micro-polarization region curves (Fig.
3b
) and Tafel slopes (Supplementary Fig.
23
) further confirm that PMene-Ru
0.18
has excellent catalytic dynamics, demonstrating the importance of structural conversion to intermetallics and the introduction of Ru–O
3
sites towards high-efficiency HOR catalysis.

PMene-Ru

presents fast kinetics with

and

k, s
of 12.18 mA cm
−2
, exceeding Pt/C by 32.5 and 22.9 times, respectively (Fig.

and Supplementary Table

). Exchange current density (
j
0
) was then calculated by fitting the Butler–Volmer equation within the micro-polarization region and normalized by the total mass of noble metals and ECSA, respectively (
Methods
and Supplementary Table
7
). As shown in Fig.
3d
, PMene-Ru
0.18
possesses remarkable values with
j
0, m
of 0.94 mA μg
−1
and
j
0, s
of 1.00 mA cm
−2
. The high exchange current density of PMene-Ru
0.18
implies predominant reversibility of HOR, also verified by the large transfer coefficient (Supplementary Table
7
), indicating that the HOR process has faster kinetics than HER in all the metallene systems. A well-tuned electronic structure, high ECSA and Ru–O
3
-assisted synergetic reaction pathway provide PMene-Ru
0.18
with some of the best specific and mass activities reported for Pd-based HOR electrocatalysts (Fig.
3e
and Supplementary Tables
8
and
9
).
The Levich plot between geometric area-normalized current density and

shows that PMene-Ru
0.18
has a slope of 4.65 cm

s
−1/2
(Supplementary Fig.

), close to the theoretical value of 4.78 cm
2
mA
−1
s
−1/2
, indicating a two-electron transfer for HOR on PMene-Ru
0.18
(ref.
45
). PMene-Ru
0.18
also exhibits excellent stability with negligible decay after a 5,000-cycle accelerated durability test (ADT, Fig.
3f
), a process during which the valence states of various elements and especially, the significant Ru–O
3
coordination mode, remain stable (Supplementary Figs.
25
and
26
and Supplementary Table
3
). An anti-CO poisoning ability with only 19% loss during the chronoamperometry measurement was also observed for PMene-Ru
0.18
, which represents an improvement over the commercial PtRu counterpart (Fig.
3g
).
Mechanism study and theoretical investigation
To show the function of Ru–O
3
atomic sites towards enhanced HOR electrocatalysis, PMene-Ru
0.1
and PMene-Ru
0.4
were prepared with similar morphology and size to PMene-Ru
0.18
(
Methods
, Supplementary Fig.
27
and Supplementary Table
1
). XRD patterns suggest gradually distinct characteristic peaks with increased Ru concentration (Fig.
4a
), suggesting a more prominent intermetallic nature. Ru K edge XANES spectra (Supplementary Fig.
28a
) and EXAFS fitting (Supplementary Fig.
28b
and Supplementary Fig.
29
) of all three PMenes illustrate that with the increase of Ru content, higher valence and an increased proportion of Ru–O configuration emerge gradually. Interestingly, introduction of a small amount of Ru tends to leave a larger amount of metallic Ru (Fig.
4b
), which probably refers to an incipient or incomplete auto-catalytic process because a high residue of Pt can also be detected in PMene-Ru
0.1
. By contrast, both PMene-Ru
0.18
and PMene-Ru
0.4
contain exclusively Ru–O bonds with approximate CN of about 3.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, Supplementary Fig.
30
) data demonstrate that the extra O atoms from PMene-Ru
0.18
to PMene-Ru
0.4
originate from the reductive uncoordinated oxygen sites. Furthermore, similar fitting results can be found for Pd in all three PMenes, again, excluding the influence of strain and coordination effects (Supplementary Fig.
31
). More advanced, general analysis of XPS spectra of Pd 3
d
, Ir 4
f
, Ru 3
p
and Mo 3
d
(Supplementary Fig.
32
) indicates that only the binding energy of high-valence Ru experiences significant change when adjusting its content (Fig.
4c
), wherein other elements remain in similar states, indicating the decisive role of Ru–O
3
sites. XPS O 1
s
spectra of three PMenes further confirm the lower Ru–O proportion in PMene-Ru
0.1
and decreased unsaturated surface coordinated oxygen (M–O
*
) in PMene-Ru
0.4
(Fig.
4d
).
The ECSAs of PMene-Ru
0.1
and PMene-Ru
0.4
were calculated using the Cu
upd
methods (Supplementary Fig.
33
). XPS-VB spectra confirm that the most downshifted
d
-band centre is PMene-Ru
0.18
among all three PMenes (Fig.
4e
). CV and CO-stripping curves of different PMenes show more weakened HBE and apparently enhanced OHBE over PMene-Ru
0.18
/PMene-Ru
0.4
than those of PMene-Ru
0.1
(Supplementary Figs.
34
and
35
), demonstrating the crucial effect of Ru–O
3
sites rather than metallic Ru for the electrochemical property regulation of the catalyst surfaces. The HOR LSVs, micro-polarization regions (Supplementary Fig.
36
) and the fitted
j
k
/
j
0
values (Supplementary Tables
6
and
7
) of three PMenes show a volcano trend between HOR activity and Ru–O
3
content rather than a monotonically increasing relationship, with PMene-Ru
0.18
achieving the highest performances (Fig.
4f
). This indicates that Ru–O
3
cannot be the only active site involved in HOR catalysis.
To further verify the hypothetical role of Ru–O
3
and ensure an authentic pathway along the HOR reaction coordinate, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out on representative models. Considering the sophisticated active sites on the surface of multi-element PMene-Ru
0.18
, extended high-potential HOR LSV curves were recorded to help deduce the possible H-adsorbed location since the characteristic break-down potential at which Faradic current starts to decay can to some extent reflect the chemical nature of active sites
46
,
47
. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
37a
, we extended the regular sweeping window from 0.6 to 1.5 V (versus RHE) and observed gradually increasing adsorption peaks of Pt–
*
H and Pt–
*
OH for the PtRu/C catalyst with the decrease of metallic Ru-related Ru–
*
H and Ru oxidation peaks as the number of scans increased. This indicates the definite participation of surface Ru atoms as original
*
H-adsorbed active sites under formal HOR conditions in the PtRu system. Its low break-down potential (0.63 V versus RHE) further confirms this deduction. Metallenes, in contrast, exhibit no obvious Ru–
*
H peak, implying that there are fewer metallic Ru atoms on the surface or they are not included in the hydrogen capture procedure (Supplementary Fig.
37b
). Either apparent M–
*
H (M = Pt or Pd) peak situated at ~0.3 V versus RHE of BMene and QMene or higher break-down potential at about 0.8 V versus RHE demonstrates that a PGM, suggested to be Pd here, serves as a main H-adsorbed site in all metallene materials. We applied the H
upd
peak potential and the CO oxidation peak potential as descriptors for HBE and OHBE, respectively and correlated them with the intrinsic HOR kinetics (represented here as
j
k, s
). As a result, non-linear trends were obtained for each descriptor (Supplementary Fig.
38
), showing poor consistency with the classic volcano prediction and thus indicating an independent dual determination from both HBE and OHBE (ref.
46
).
Based on the above analysis, we built four typical models, calculated the adsorption energies of
*
H,
*
OH and
*
H
2
O with proper selection of active sites for each and selected the
*
OH-involved synergistic mechanism for the HOR pathway. The four conceptual models include quinary intermetallics with O (QI+O, using an XRD-simulated model with extra added surface O atoms corresponding to PMene-Ru
0.18
, Supplementary Fig.
39
), quinary intermetallics without O (QI, Supplementary Fig.
40
), quinary fcc-alloy with O (QA+O, Supplementary Fig.
41
) and quinary fcc-alloy without O (QA, Supplementary Fig.
42
), allowing us the opportunity to assess the function of the hcp intermetallic structure and Ru–O
3
configuration separately. Firstly, the Bader charges of surface Pd sites were calculated, both with and without extra O species connected to adjacent Ru atoms, to evaluate their H-adsorption behaviours. As shown in Fig.
5a
, the formation of Ru–O
3
induces reduced electron density around the Pd site that increases its Bader charge from −0.275
e
in QI to −0.004
e
in QI+O, in good agreement with the XPS data. This further leads to an impaired Pd–H bond (elongated from 1.846 to 1.877 Å), indicating that the introduction of Ru–O
3
sites weakens the hydrogen adsorption ability of the less negative Pd site through a reduced Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, the OHBEs of each model were also obtained, from which one can perceive a properly enhanced OHBE for QI+O compared with that of QA+O (Supplementary Fig.
43
and Supplementary Table
10
).

The free-energy trend along each reaction coordinate was also investigated to examine the HOR mechanism on PMene-Ru
0.18
(Fig.
5b
). Subject to rather high nucleophilicity, Pd atoms in both QA and QI suffer from over-strong hydrogen adsorption, the HBEs of which get effectively weakened only when surface oxygen species are introduced so as to meet QA+O and QI+O. As for the crucial synergistic step, the surface O species inevitably provide a repulsion force against
*
OH groups to account for the weakened hydroxyl adsorption. The intensified electronic interaction originates from the intermetallic atomic arrangement and this regulates the
d
-band structure of QI+O, resulting in a moderately strengthened OHBE. The optimal H
2
OBE can also be attributed to the influence of reinforcement from intermetallics-induced adsorption and reduction from Ru–O
3
site-derived adsorption. Such a two-tier tuning guarantees that QI+O has the smallest energy barrier of ~0.45 eV for its favourable water formation, 0.07 and 0.36 eV lower than those of QI and QA, respectively. Contrarily, the potential-determining step (PDS) of QA+O is the step of
*
OH adsorption, a thermodynamically unfavourable process with a high energy barrier up to 0.65 eV. This indicates it is less likely to undergo the bi-functional pathway. As such, a reconciled balance on adsorption was achieved between different HOR-involved intermediates so that poisoning of active sites by either too strong
*
H intermediates or over-intensified
*
OH/
*
H
2
O species is avoided.
In situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was used to verify the adsorption behaviours of PMene-Ru
0.18
. In Fig.
5c
, a dominant Ru–
*
OH adsorption peak was detected at 776 cm
−1
at 0.05 V versus RHE and this gradually red-shifted to 769 cm
−1
at 0.4 V versus RHE for PMene-Ru
0.18
(ref.
48
), while a stronger Ru–
*
OH binding was probed for PtRu nanosheets at 775–781 cm
−1
(Fig.
5d
). Moreover, the strengthened adsorption of H
2
O was also confirmed for PMene-Ru
0.18
by its blue-shifting H–O–H stretching vibration peaks
49
from 1,647 to 1,658 cm
−1
, much higher than those of PdRu
0
red-shifting from 1,636 to 1,628 cm
−1
. Such spectroscopy outcomes agree well with previous DFT calculations, both of which are supportive of our mechanistic proposals. We summarize the promotion mechanism of HOR catalysis on PMene-Ru
0.18
in Fig.
5e
, where the intrinsic hcp intermetallic nature plays vital roles in strengthening OHBE and H
2
OBE. The tailored surface Ru–O
3
atomic sites help weaken the adsorptions of all the related intermediates including
*
H,
*
OH and
*
H
2
O, two of which mutually contribute to a preferential reaction pathway with the lowest energy barrier.
In summary, we report the synthesis of a Pd-based multi-element penta-metallene with sub-nano thickness and an unconventional hcp phase via an auto-catalytic method. The intermetallic structure and uniformly distributed isolated Ru–O
3
atomic sites mutually realize the optimally balanced modulation of intermediate binding energy. In situ SERS spectra and DFT calculations demonstrate a two-tier tuning from the intermetallics-induced strong ligand effect and intrinsic repulsion between oxygen moieties, leading to intensively weakened HBE and moderately enhanced OHBE and H
2
OBE. As a result, the as-made PMene-Ru
0.18
provides excellent HOR performance, with fast kinetics and excellent durability and anti-CO poisoning ability. This is promising for lowering the noble metal loading of fuel cell devices.

and 5 ml OAm were added into a 15 ml glass vial and stirred in an oil bath at 50 °C for 1 h. The as-obtained dark-purple solution was then heated to 220 °C with a slow heating rate (3–4 °C min
−1
) and this was maintained for 3 h. After the solution was cooled down to room temperature, the black product was collected by centrifugation at 8,900
g
and washed twice with cyclohexane for further processing. For PMene-Ru
0.1
and PMene-Ru
0.4
, the same procedures were followed except that the amount of Ru(acac)
3
was changed from 3.8 mg to 1.9 mg and 7.5 mg, respectively.
QMene was synthesized following a similar procedure without the addition of Ru(acac)
3
. For BMene, the same method was applied without the addition of both Pt(acac)
2
and Ru(acac)
3
.
Preparation of Mene/C catalysts
The as-prepared BMene, QMene and PMene-Ru
x
(
x
= 0.1, 0.18, 0.4) catalysts were loaded onto carbon supports for electrochemical tests. Typically, the cyclohexane dispersion of different Menes was mixed with a certain amount of Vulcan XC-72 in ethanol/cyclohexane mixture (volume ratio ≈ 1:4) under ambient sonication for 1 h. The product was then collected by centrifugation at 11,125
g
, washed twice with ethanol and dried at 60 °C for 1 h without any other postprocessing.
XAFS experiments and EXAFS data processing
XAFS measurements were carried out at the BL14W1 and BL11B beamlines of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) as well as at the 1W1B beamline at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). A Lytle detector was used to collect fluorescence signals for the element Ru. The EXAFS data analysis was performed using Athena and Artemis software packages according to the standard data analysis procedures. FT-EXAFS spectra were obtained with a similar
k
region as shown in this profile (Fig.
2c
) so as to acquire comparable CNs. Finally, wavelet transform (WT)-EXAFS images were obtained from
k
3
-weighted EXAFS data using the Morlet function in a Fortran program.
Electrochemical measurements
To get homogeneous catalyst ink of 1 mg ml
−1
, as-obtained Mene/C products were subsequently dispersed in a mixture of ultrapure water, isopropanol and Nafion D-521 solution (volume ratio = 1:1:0.04) by sonication for 1 h. A three-electrode system (glass carbon with a diameter of 5 mm coated with catalyst ink as the working electrode, carbon as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode in saturated KCl solution calibrated to be 1.008–1.011 V versus RHE as the reference electrode) and a specifically designed cell with good sealing performance were used to conduct alkaline HOR tests on a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The metal loading (total noble metal, including Pd, Ir, Ru and Pt) on the electrode of every test was controlled to be approximately 10 μg cm
−2
.
For electrochemical assessments, fast CVs (500 mV s
−1
, 0.05–1.1 V, in 0.1 M N
2
-saturated KOH solution) were conducted to activate the catalysts until stable surface states were obtained and then slow CVs at 50 mV s
−1
for the same potential region were recorded. HOR polarization curves were recorded from −0.1 to 0.6 V versus RHE in 0.1 M H
2
-saturated KOH solution at a sweep rate of 10 mV s
−1
and a rotation speed of 1,600 r.p.m. All HOR curves were 95%-iR-compensated (where iR is Ohmic drop) before applying the Koutecky–Levich equation
$${j}_{{\rm{k}}}=({j}_{{\rm{d}}}\times j)/({j}_{{\rm{d}}}-j)$$
(1)
where
j
d
represents the limiting current density, recorded as the average value under 0.4–0.5 V versus RHE and
j
represents the measured current density at 50 mV versus RHE. ECSAs of Pt/C and commercial PtRu/C catalysts were calculated using their hydrogen under potential deposition (H
upd
) peak (0.05–0.4 V versus RHE, desorption only) tested in 0.1 M HClO
4
while those of Mene/C samples were calculated through their Cu
upd
integrated area (
i–t
: 0.3 V versus RHE, 100 s).
The accelerated durability test (ADT) was recorded by cycling between 0 and 0.3 V versus RHE at 100 mV s
−1
for 5,000 cycles in 0.1 M H
2
-saturated KOH solution at 1,600 r.p.m. For the CO-stripping measurements, high-purity CO gas was bubbled into 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M HClO
4
solution for 20 min at a constant potential of 0.1 V versus RHE before stripping curves were collected in N
2
-saturated solutions at 20 mV s
−1
. For anti-CO performance assessment, the same procedures were performed as above except that the LSV curves were replaced by a chronoamperometry test (
i-t
) performed at 0.1 V versus RHE at 1,600 r,p.m. in 0.1 M H
2
per 1,000 ppm CO-saturated KOH.
The theoretical K–L slope of each Levich plot, represented by
B
L
, was calculated according to the following equation
$${{{B}}}_{\mathrm{L}}=0.62{{{n{\mathrm{F}}D}}}_{0}^{2/3}{\nu }^{-1/6}{{{C}}}_{0}$$
(2)
where
B
L
is the Levich constant,
n
is the theoretical electron transfer number (2), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol

),
D
0
represents the diffusion coefficient of H
2
in 0.1 M KOH (3.7 × 10

−1
),
ν
is the electrolyte kinematic viscosity (0.01009 cm
2
s
−1
) and
C
0
is the bulk concentration of H
2
solubility (7.33 × 10
−4
mol dm
−3
). The constant 0.62 is adopted when the rotation speed of
ω
is expressed in rad s
−1
. The practical K–L slope was obtained by applying different rotating rates (
ω
) to obtain the HOR LSV curves and then referring to the equation
$${j}^{-1}={j}_{\mathrm {k}}^{-1}+{({{{BC}}}_{0})}^{-1}{\omega }^{-1/2}$$
(3)
Two related factors about HOR, namely exchange current density (
j
0
) and transfer coefficient
α
, can be obtained by fitting the Butler-Volmer equation
$${j}_{\mathrm {k}}={j}_{0}\times \left\{{\rm{e}}^{\left(\alpha {\mathrm{F}}\eta /{\mathrm{R}}{T}\right)}-{\rm{e}}^{\left[\left(\alpha -1\right){\mathrm{F}}\eta /\left.{\mathrm{R}}{T}\right)\right]}\right\}$$
(4)
where R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol
−1
K
−1
),
T
is the Kelvin temperature (298.15 K) and
η
accounts for overpotential.
In situ Raman experimental setup
The electrochemical Raman measurements were carried out on a Horiba Jobin Yvon HR evolution system, with a gas-cooled light source of 532 nm excitation wavelength and a 50× Olympus microscope objective (Olympus, 0.50 numerical aperture). A multi-channel charge-coupled device (1,024 × 256 pixels) was used and the Raman frequency was calibrated with a Si wafer during each experiment. In situ electrochemical Raman experiments were used with a resolution of 3 cm
−1
.
Computational details for XRD simulation and DFT calculation
The simulation of XRD patterns for all the optimized models was performed with the VESTA program using Cu radiation (
λ
= 1.5406 Å) in the 2
θ
range 5–45°. The DFT calculations were carried out using VASP (refs.
50
,
51
) while the exchange–correlation function was described within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
52
,
53
parameterized by the Perdew–Burke-Enzerhof (PBE) functional. The cut-off energy for the plane wave basis was set to 450 eV. The convergence criteria for electronic structure and geometry relaxation were 5 × 10
−5
eV and 0.02 eV Å
−1
, respectively. The structures of QI+O/OI were based on the results of XRD simulations demonstrated above. The hcp-(0001)/fcc-(111) facet was constructed by cutting the bulk model along the 0001/111 direction and four layers were selected, in which the top two atomic layers were allowed to relax. A vacuum spacing of 20 Å was added in the
z
-direction to avoid the interaction between the slab and its repeated motif. This leads to reasonable relaxation of the as-applied XRD-simulated model, causing its lattice to expand along the
c
axis. The Monkhorst–Pack method was used for sampling the Brillouin zone with a 3 × 3 × 1 mesh.
