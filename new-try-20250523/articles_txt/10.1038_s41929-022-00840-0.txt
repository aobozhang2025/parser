Abstract
Copper-based catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO
2
to methanol have attracted much interest. The complex nature of these catalysts, however, renders the elucidation of their structure–activity properties difficult. Here we report a copper-based catalyst with isolated active copper sites for the hydrogenation of CO
2
to methanol. It is revealed that the single-atom Cu–Zr catalyst with Cu
1
–O
3
units contributes solely to methanol synthesis around 180 °C, while the presence of small copper clusters or nanoparticles with Cu–Cu structural patterns are responsible for forming the CO by-product. Furthermore, the gradual migration of Cu
1
–O
3
units with a quasiplanar structure to the catalyst surface is observed during the catalytic process and accelerates CO
2
hydrogenation. The highly active, isolated copper sites and the distinguishable structural pattern identified here extend the horizon of single-atom catalysts for applications in thermal catalytic CO
2
hydrogenation and could guide the further design of high-performance copper-based catalysts to meet industrial demand.

Main
The excessive use of fossil fuels in recent decades has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of CO
2
in the atmosphere, which has caused serious damage to the natural environment. Hence, the related C1 chemistry has become an important research area because one of the most challenging scientific issues is to find alternative energy sources to replace petroleum in the 21st century
1
. In particular, the industrial conversion of excess CO
2
into high-value-added chemicals and energy fuels can not only effectively mitigate the greenhouse effect, but also represents a sustainable use of natural resources

3
OH catalysis from CO
2
is of great commercial value. Therefore, in the past few decades, much research has been performed to find catalysts with good performance, including metal–metal oxides (Cu/ZnO/Al

Among CO
2
hydrogenation catalysts, copper catalysts have attracted much attention because of their excellent catalytic activity and stability for CH
3
OH synthesis
19
,
27
. However, the actual active sites for various products in copper-based catalysts are difficult to pinpoint due to the complex coordination structure of copper species. The diversity of valence states of copper species and the particularity of hydrogenation reactions means that copper mostly exists in mixed valence states during these reactions. There are conflicting reports in the literature showing that either Cu
0
, Cu
+
or Cu
δ
+
may be active sites
18
,
19
,
28
,
29
. Moreover, the physical size of copper nanoparticles also profoundly affects the catalytic performance
17
,
30
,
31
,
32
,
33
. These different factors have a great impact on the coordination structure of copper itself, which makes it difficult to study the actual active copper sites for CO
2
hydrogenation. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the active sites of copper catalysts, there is still much controversy about the structure–performance correlation between catalyst and reaction
18
,
32
,
34
,
35
,
36
.
For the above reasons, catalysts with stable and uniform sites are necessary for the study of related catalytic structure–activity relationships. The single-atom catalyst is an ideal model for active sites study due to its uniform metal sites which are embodied in the homogeneous catalyst
37
,
38
,
39
. However, such work is rarely reported because it is difficult to construct effective and stable active sites in the thermal catalytic hydrogenation of CO
2
to CH
3
OH (refs.
33
,
40
,
41
,
42
). Here we synthesized an efficient Cu
1
/ZrO
2
single-atom catalyst to realize the CO
2
hydrogenation reaction to CH
3
OH at relatively low temperature (180 °C). Compared to typical Cu/ZrO
2
catalysts, the monoatomic dispersed Cu
1
/ZrO
2
displayed a higher turnover frequency (TOF) for CH
3
OH and 100% CH
3
OH selectivity. Starting from the structure of the monatomic catalyst model, the relationship between the structure of active copper sites and the formation of methanol or CO is explored in depth.
Results
The design of copper catalysts with different structure models
A series of Cu/ZrO
2
catalysts with different copper loadings (1–15 wt%) were synthesized by a modified co-precipitation and impregnation method. The copper-based amorphous/monoclinic ZrO
2
with different amounts of copper (
x
wt%) were named CAZ-
x
and CMZ-
x
, respectively. The actual copper concentration in various Cu/ZrO
2
samples was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Supplementary Table
1
). As shown in Supplementary Fig.
1a
, all the Cu/a-ZrO
2
catalysts with different copper loading amounts exhibited an amorphous state of ZrO
2
and no X-ray diffraction peaks of CuO species, suggesting that the copper species were highly dispersed on a-ZrO
2
(ref.
43
). The similar specific surface areas and pore structures also indicated a high degree of dispersion of copper species (Supplementary Table
2
). Notably, a-ZrO
2
transformed to tetragonal phase without adding Cu
2+
precursor during the same co-precipitation procedure (Supplementary Fig.
1b
). The change in phase indicated that a strong interaction effect existed between copper and ZrO
2
. The broad Raman spectroscopy peak at 523 cm
−1
also confirmed amorphous zirconia was formed in Cu/a-ZrO
2
catalysts with various copper loadings (Supplementary Fig.
2
)
44
.
To confirm the hyperfine structure of the Cu/a-ZrO
2
catalysts at the atomic scale, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were used. The HAADF-STEM images of CAZ-1 (Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.
3
) showed that the sample consisted of a-ZrO
2
with no copper species nanoparticles on it. Elemental mapping (Fig.
1d
) also confirmed highly dispersed copper sites were located in the CAZ-1 catalyst, consistent with the XRD and HAADF-STEM results. For copper loading amounts of up to 15 wt%, the copper species remained highly dispersed on the ZrO
2
substrate (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
4
). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy in R space and corresponding wavelet transform (WT) spectra supplied more important information about the structure of the catalysts, as shown in Fig.
1g,h
and Supplementary Fig.
5a
. Only one apparent peak at 1.92 Å corresponding to the first coordination shell of Cu–O scattering could be detected in CAZ-1 and CAZ-15. This provided evidence that copper sites were atomically dispersed in CAZ-1 and CAZ-15 because no Cu–(O)–Cu or Cu–Cu metallic bonds were observed
45
. It is difficult to completely exclude copper single atoms by just increasing the copper loading in CAZ-
x
catalysts due to the unique molecular interactions between copper and a-ZrO
2
. Therefore, catalysts containing 15 wt% copper were synthesized with CuO nanoparticles over monoclinic ZrO
2
substrate (CMZ-15) and bare Q50 (SiO
2
) (CS-15), and served as reference catalysts. The obvious X-ray diffraction peaks at 35.5° and 38.7° (Supplementary Fig.
6a,b
) and the Raman peak at 291 cm
−1
(Supplementary Fig.
2
) correspond to the existence of CuO nanoparticles
46
. The highly agglomerated CuO particles were also observed in the CMZ-15 (15-30 nm) and CS-15 (
∼
0.6 μm) catalysts from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and correspoding elemental mapping (Fig.
1c,f
and Supplementary Fig.
7a
–j
). Moreover, an additional smaller peak corresponding to CuO at 2.81 Å was observed in EXAFS and WT spectra (Fig.
1g
, Supplementary Fig.
5b
), ascribed to Cu–(O)–Cu scattering at the second shell, confirming the formation of CuO particles
47
. In summary, the copper species existed as single atoms and large CuO particles in the CAZ-
x
(
x
= 1–15 wt%) series catalysts and CMZ-15 samples, respectively.

Catalytic performance for CO
2
hydrogenation
The catalytic performance of Cu/ZrO
2
catalysts for hydrogenation of CO
2
to CH
3
OH was evaluated at 180 °C and 3 MPa with CO
2
/H
2
mixed gas (CO
2
:H
2
= 1:3). Prior to reaction, CAZ-
x
(
x
= 1–15 wt%) catalysts were pretreated at 230 °C for 10 h under an argon atmosphere. CAZ-1, CMZ-15 and CS-15 were pretreated at 300–370 °C under a hydrogen atmosphere to form metallic copper particle species. The CO
2
conversion over all the catalysts was controlled to less than 10% to study their intrinsic activity, which was far lower than the CO
2
equilibrium conversion under reaction conditions (29.7% at 180 °C; Supplementary Fig.
8
). As shown in Fig.
2a,b
and Supplementary Table
3
, using CAZ-1 resulted in the detection of only CH
3
OH, and no by-products, and this catalyst preferentially produced CH
3
OH with a TOF
Cu
value of up to 1.37 h
−1
. We have therefore synthesized a ‘homogeneous’ active site catalyst with excellent stability for CH
3
OH production from CO
2
hydrogenation. However, CO
2
could not be activated by CAZ-1-r (CAZ-1 pre-reduced by H
2
at 370 °C to form large copper particles), CMZ-15 and CS-15 catalysts, according to the high aggregation of copper species into large particles, confirmed by the X-ray diffraction results (Supplementary Figs.
6a,b
and
9
) and H
2
temperature programmed reduction (TPR) (Supplementary Fig.
10b
). Therefore, the highly dispersed, isolated copper species might be the actual active sites for CH
3
OH synthesis from CO
2
at low temperatures. Compared with the Cu/ZrO
2
catalysts reported previously in the literature, the CAZ-1 with single-atom copper sites in this work offers advantageous catalytic performance for methanol synthesis (Supplementary Table
4
). As the copper amount increases in the CAZ-
x
catalysts (Fig.
2c
), CO starts to be produced from CAZ-4 catalyst, indicating additional active sites were formed in these high-copper-loading catalysts (Supplementary Fig.
11
) during the reaction process. It was inferred that the copper clusters or small nanoparticles that form on CAZ-
x
catalysts (>4 wt% Cu) played a crucial role in accelerating reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction since no activity was observed over CAZ-1-r, CMZ-15 and CS-15 catalysts with large metallic copper particles. These catalysts exhibited excellent intrinsic activity in the low loading range (<2 wt% Cu). A good linear growth relationship of CO
2
conversion was observed for CAZ-1, CAZ-1.5, CAZ-2 and CAZ-2.5, with only CH
3
OH being produced (Supplementary Fig.
12a
). The ratios of R

/R

(R

2
conversion/actual copper loading,
x
= 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4) for CAZ-1.5/CAZ-1, CAZ-2/CAZ-1, CAZ-2.5/CAZ-1 and CAZ-4/CAZ-1 are 0.99, 0.96, 0.97 and 0.67, respectively, indicating that the active copper sites were uniformly dispersed and exposed on the catalysts’ surface in the single-atom state in CAZ-
x
(
x
= 1–2.5). However, the increasing trend of conversion rate decreased for copper contents higher than 4 wt% (R
4
/R
1
= 0.67), since the copper clusters could not provide CO
2
activation ability as strong as that of isolated active copper sites, and hence the CO selectivity was much lower than the CH
3
OH selectivity. When the copper loading amount was more than 8 wt%, the surface of the catalyst was filled up with copper clusters and isolated Cu
δ+
sites at the same time as large particles of Cu
0
—which have no CO
2
activation ability—gradually formed (Supplementary Fig.
12b
), resulting in no further increase of the CO
2
conversion due to the saturation of surface-active sites.

Further evidence for this mechanism is provided by the catalytic performance and ICP-OES results (Supplementary Table
1
) of CAZ-15-H (where CAZ-15-H is CAZ-15 pretreated with HNO
3
for 20 h), where the large copper nanoparticles were partially removed. The catalytic performance was similar to that of CAZ-8–15 and the actual copper loading amount was close to that of CAZ-8, indicating that the effective active sites of copper species on a-ZrO
2
surface comprised about 7–8 wt%. In addition, we also proved that the active sites in the catalyst were in a very stable structure that even strong acid could not break. CAZ-1 was also tested in the CO
2
conversion reaction continuously for 100 h to evaluate its catalytic stability (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Fig.
13a,b
). After an induction period of a couple of hours, the catalyst with isolated active copper sites gave both very stable CO
2
conversion and target product selectivity, demonstrating that the catalyst possesses an extremely stable structure in the CO
2
hydrogenation reaction. Furthermore, fresh and used CAZ-1 catalysts had similar weight loss and heat absorption/exothermic trends, indicating that CAZ-1 has a stable structure with no carbon deposition on its surface during low-temperature reaction (Supplementary Fig.
14
).
Surface electronic state and coordination structure
The electronic state and short-range coordination environment of the catalysts were investigated to study their relationship to the catalytic performance. The Cu 2
p
species for CAZ-1 and CAZ-1-U (where U signifies used) were located at about 931.9 eV, and their Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) (Supplementary Fig.
15a,b
) signals were located at 916.5 eV, indicating the presence of Cu
+
in the samples before and after the reaction
48
. For the CAZ-15 sample, the content of Cu
2+
species decreased significantly after the reaction (from 66% to 32%; Supplementary Table
5
and Supplementary Fig.
15a,b
), indicating that the Cu
2+
was partially in situ reduced to Cu
0
during the reaction (Supplementary Fig.
12b
). The coexisting Cu
0
clusters or small particles and Cu
δ+
species in CAZ-15 convert CO
2
to CO and CH
3
OH, respectively.
Because the accuracy of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was insufficient while the copper species were highly dispersed with low loading amounts
49
,
50
,
51
,
52
,
53
, the valence state of catalysts was confirmed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements for more accurate investigations (Fig.
3a–d
and Supplementary Fig.
16a–c
). In comparison to the copper foil, the absorption edges for CAZ-1 and CAZ-1-U shifted to higher energy, indicating that the copper atoms were in an oxidized state (Fig.
3a
). Peaks A (Cu
2+
, 8,978 eV, 1
s
→ 3
d
), B (Cu
2+
, 8,985 eV, 1
s
→ 4
p
) and C (Cu
2+
, 8,997 eV, 1
s
→ 4
p
) were similar to those of CuO in the XANES spectrum (Fig.
3b
), but the details were different (the intensity of these peaks, especially peak D at 9,010.8 eV, represent multiple scattering of Cu
2+
). This indicated that the valence of copper species in fresh and used CAZ-1 were close to 2+ (refs.
45
,
51
,
54
). To reflect the true valence information of copper species in CAZ-1 during the reaction process, an in situ XAS test was performed. As shown in Fig.
3a–c
, the absorption edge and first derivative of CAZ-1 (in situ) was between Cu
+
and Cu
2+
, suggesting the oxidation state of Cu
δ
+
(1 <
δ
< 2) species. Based on the XANES spectra of copper foil, Cu
2
O and CuO, the valence of Cu
δ
+
(in situ) was estimated to be
∼
1.4 according to our linear fitting results, as shown in Fig.
3d
. Therefore, it was deduced that the valence of copper species in CAZ-1 and CAZ-1-U was close to 2+ but would be decreased to
∼
1.4+ during the CO
2
hydrogenation reaction. Although the fresh CAZ-15 also gave a similar XANES spectra as CAZ-1, the copper species would be changed into a different state during the reaction process, leading to their distinctly different catalytic performances (Supplementary Fig.
6c,d
and Fig.
2c
). As for CMZ-15, an apparent pre-edge peak at 8,984 eV was detected, which confirmed that the CuO particle was embodied in CMZ-15 (Supplementary Fig.
6c, d
)
55
, corresponding to the X-ray diffraction results (Supplementary Fig.
6a
).

The EXAFS fitting data for Cu/ZrO
2
are shown in Fig.
3e–g
, Supplementary Fig.
16d–j
and Supplementary Table
6
. The copper species in CAZ-1 remained monodispersed after the reaction, and the average Cu–O coordination numbers before and after the reaction were 2.84 and 2.72, respectively. Combined with the results of theoretical calculations (Cu
1
–O
3
has the lowest surface potential; Supplementary Fig.
17
), these data indicate that the local structure of CAZ-1 comprised one isolated copper atom coordinated with about three oxygen atoms (Cu
1
–O
3
units) in a quasiplanar structure with an angle of about 11° between the copper and oxygen atoms on the a-ZrO
2
surface (Fig.
3h
). Furthermore, in situ EXAFS was used to study the structure of CAZ-1 under operando conditions. The fitted data indicated that reduction of the copper species in CAZ-1 to metallic copper was difficult under the reaction conditions, which was consistent with the results of H
2
-TPR (Supplementary Fig.
10a, c
), indicating that the copper species were still distributed in a single-atom state. The Cu–O coordination number slightly decreased to 2.56 during the reaction, accompanied by a slight decrease in the valence state. Meanwhile, the Cu–O bond became slightly longer under the reaction conditions (increasing from 1.92 to 2.05 Å; Supplementary Table
6
), indicating that the Cu
1
–O
3
sites were activated under the reaction conditions.
The active sites for copper-based catalysts
It was hypothesized that isolated Cu
1
–O
3
sites might favour CO
2
conversion to CH
3
OH. Because no copper particles were detected in the spent CAZ-1 (Fig.
4a
and Supplementary Fig.
18a
), we concluded that isolated Cu
1
–O
3
active sites in Cu/ZrO
2
were in fact stable. However, the local copper particles with 0.21 nm spacing of the Cu(111) planes
16
,
56
,
57
,
58
detected in CAZ-15-U by HRTEM (Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Fig.
18b
) revealed that copper species were partially aggregated and reduced during the catalytic process, consistent with the X-ray diffraction results (Fig.
4c
). H
2
-TPR was also performed to elucidate the evolution of the copper species under a reduced atmosphere (Supplementary Fig.
10
). The TPR results indicated that reduction of the Cu
δ+
species in CAZ-1 was difficult: only one peak at 360 °C appeared, which was much higher than the actual reaction temperature, indicating the stability of Cu
1
–O
3
active sites. As the copper content increased from 1 wt% to 15 wt%, this reduction peak shifted to lower temperatures, demonstrating that the interaction between the copper species and ZrO
2
carrier gradually weakened. The explanation for this behaviour is that the copper species is more easily aggregated and thereby further reduced as its loading amount increased. The X-ray diffraction results (Fig.
4c
and Supplementary Fig.
12b
) also supported this hypothesis: no copper particle diffraction peaks were detected and the crystal structure remained in the amorphous state for used CAZ-1 catalyst. In contrast, two obvious sharp peaks (43.3° and 50.4°)
59
,
60
appeared in used CMZ-15 and CS-15, suggesting the formation of copper from CuO reduction (Supplementary Fig.
6
), which was corroborated by TEM (Supplementary Figs.
19
and
20
). Furthermore, in situ X-ray diffraction was employed to investigate the dynamic evolution of Cu
δ+
species in Cu/a-ZrO
2
under a hydrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig.
4d
, no signal of Cu
0
was observed in CAZ-1 catalyst with increasing temperature (30 → 180 → 230 → 300 → 350 °C). However, for CAZ-15, two faint signals at 43.3° and 50.4° appeared, and the intensity of these gradually increased as the temperature increased from 180 to 350 °C in a hydrogen atmosphere. Therefore, the Cu
2+
species in CAZ-15 were partially reduced at 180 °C and high temperatures could further increase their degree of reduction. H
2
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) (Supplementary Fig.
21
) showed peaks at
∼
420 °C that were assigned to sites of H
2
absorption at copper species and a-ZrO

substrate. Compared with CAZ-1, the corresponding peak in CAZ-15 migrated to a higher temperature (415 °C → 430 °C), possibly caused by the greater number of supplied adsorption sites on the CAZ-15 surface, indicating that the structure of copper species in CAZ-15 was more complex and non-unique. Based on the above results, it was concluded that the dispersion of copper species in CAZ-1 was still in the single-atom state; copper single atoms with partially reduced clusters or nanoparticles coexisted in CAZ-15 during the reaction. As for CMZ-15 and CS-15, both the X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Fig.
6
) and TEM (Supplementary Figs.
19
and
20
) results indicated that almost all the copper species on the surface were reduced to larger copper particles during the reaction.

Copper loading amounts of less than 2 wt% in CAZ-
x
catalysts yielded CH
3
OH as the only product because isolated Cu
1
–O
3
units play a crucial role in CH
3
OH synthesis (Fig.
2c
). As the copper loading amount was increased to 4 wt%, a small amount of CO was produced because a small number of reduced copper clusters or nanoparticles were formed during the reaction (Supplementary Fig.
11
), which might be active sites for the RWGS reaction. Increasing the copper content to 8 wt% also increased the proportion of CO in the products due to more copper clusters or small nanoparticles being formed. Overall, the evidence suggested that single-atom copper species with isolated Cu
1
–O
3
units and copper clusters or small nanoparticles were the active sites for generating CH
3
OH and CO, respectively. However, it was found that when the copper loading amount was further increased to 12 and 15 wt%, the CO
2
conversion and product distribution did not change further. Large particles of copper formed as the copper content further increased, but these do not activate CO
2
at low temperatures, consistent with the reaction results with CMZ-15 and CS-15 catalysts (Fig.
2a,b
). In addition, the more obvious copper bulk structure in X-ray diffraction (Fig.
4c
), and the lower-temperature H
2
-TPR copper reduction peak (Supplementary Fig.
10c
), together indicated that more metallic copper particles were generated by reducing Cu
2+
species over CAZ-15 during the reaction.

species migration during the reaction
Capturing the evolution of active metal species during reactions is essential for the in-depth understanding of active sites, especially in reactions involving hydrogen. A number of studies have shown that the gases used in the pretreatment or reaction process greatly affect the structure of catalysts, including active species migration
33
,
34
and surface reconstruction
61
,
62
. A similar effect also existed in our Cu/ZrO
2
catalyst system, where the reaction gas promoted the migration of Cu
δ
+
species from bulk to the surface of the support. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is an extremely sensitive method for analysing the dispersion of elements on a catalyst surface, and can detect the top 1–3 atomic layers of elements on such a surface (Fig.
5a,b
). Figure
5
compares fresh and used catalyst: more bright red spots were detected in Fig.
5b
, suggesting more copper species appeared on the surface of CAZ-1-U. Semiquantitative analysis of the copper surface (Fig.
5c
) also showed that the surface of CAZ-1-U contained more copper species, indicating that these species migrate to the surface during the reaction. These results were also supported by XPS analysis (Supplementary Fig.
22
): the intensity of Cu 2
p
spectra for CAZ-1-U and CAZ-15-U were much stronger than for fresh catalysts, indicating that copper species were becoming enriched on the surface of used catalysts after the reaction. Meanwhile, Cu/Zr ratios calculated by XPS further confirmed the above conclusion. The surface Cu/Zr ratios of fresh CAZ-1 and CAZ-15 samples were 0.0012 and 0.24, and the corresponding ratios for used catalysts were 0.0018 and 0.38 (Supplementary Table
5
), clearly indicating that there were more active copper sites on the surface of the catalysts after the reaction. Moreover, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy with CO absorption (DRIFT-CO) was used to verify the copper migration and supplied further important evidence. The catalysts were adsorbed to saturation in CO atmosphere before the desorption experiment was carried out with argon. The absorbed peak at 2,102 cm
−1
was assigned to linear adsorption of CO on the copper species (Supplementary Fig.
23a,b
)
46
,
63
. For the fresh catalyst, the CO concentration decreased rapidly with the argon purge time, and the surface residual concentration was close to zero at 20 min. In comparison, the desorption rate of CO on CAZ-1-U was much slower than that on the fresh catalyst, while the obvious CO signal was still observed after 20 min of gas purging. For a more intuitive comparison, the area of the CO absorption peak was normalized to 2,102 cm
−1
to give a time-dependent surface concentration attenuation spectrum with the argon purging time (Supplementary Fig.
23c
). It was concluded that the level of CO absorption on CAZ-1-U was much more than that on fresh catalyst, proving that the surface of the used catalyst contained more copper sites.

Based on the above details of the copper migration, it was inferred that a dynamic change of Cu
1
–O
3
active sites occurred during the reaction process. EXAFS data indicated that the copper species in Cu/a-ZrO
2
were mainly single atoms dispersed in the fresh catalysts, and that the copper species would migrate to the surface at a certain rate under the induction of reaction gas. This explains why the reaction had a certain initial induction period (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Fig.
13
). It was concluded that the unique Cu
1
–O
3
structure in CAZ-1 was vital for CH
3
OH synthesis at low temperatures. The copper sites in CAZ-1 remained copper single atoms with isolated Cu
1
–O
3
structure after migrating to the surface due to the small amount of copper. However, more copper sites in CAZ-15 were accumulated and in situ reduced during migration in a hydrogen atmosphere process (Fig.
4c,d
). Therefore, the migration behaviour of copper species during the reaction can be divided into three types according to the catalytic activity results. When the copper content was less than 2 wt%, the migrated copper species did not accumulate during the reaction process but were still distributed in a monodispersed state, hence only CH
3
OH was produced and CO
2
conversion was enhanced linearly with increasing copper loading. When the copper loading was 4–8 wt%, the copper species migrated to the surface and partially agglomerated, and the activity showed that CO
2
conversion and CO selectivity increased while CH
3
OH selectivity decreased due to the formed copper clusters or small nanoparticles producing CO via the RWGS reaction. Finally, when the copper loading was higher than 8 wt%, some of the copper species aggregated to form large copper particles without CO
2
activation ability, and thus the conversion of CO
2
and the product distribution were no longer changed. A schematic diagram illustrating this is shown in Fig.
5d
.
The reaction mechanism of CO
2
hydrogenation
To clarify the structure influence for absorbed species on the surface, in situ DRIFT analysis was carried out under reaction conditions. All the tests were performed at 180 °C and the assignments of all band vibration peaks are listed in Supplementary Table
7
. As shown in Fig.
6a
for CAZ-1, the active species were mainly first excited in HCO
3
*: the peaks located at 1,695 and 1,431 cm
−1
were assigned to ionic bicarbonate species i-HCO
3
* and the peaks at 1,631 and 1,226 cm
−1
to
v
as
(HCO
3
) and
v
s
(HCO
3
) of bidentate bicarbonate species b-HCO
3
* (ref.
64
), respectively. As the reaction proceeded, the HCO
3
* were slowly transformed into formate species, according to the peaks at 1,595, 1,384, 1,371, 2,736, 2,877 and 2,970 cm

which were attributed to

,

. In fact, the transformation of bicarbonates to formate appears to follow the path: HCO
3
* → CO
2
→ HCOO*. The H
2
was also necessary because no evolution of HCO
3
* to HCOO* could be detected in CAZ-1 by only absorbed CO
2
(Supplementary Fig.
24
). Meanwhile, vibration peaks at 1,072, 1,146, 2,827 and 2,935 cm
−1
for CH
3
O* were also detected, and assigned to
v
(CO)-terminal,

(CO)-bridge,
v
s
(CH
3
) and
v
as
(CH
3
)
21
,
36
,
65
. Therefore, the process of CO
2
hydrogenation to CH
3
OH in CAZ-1 followed the formate path. Furthermore, it was proved that the CH
3
OH did not came from the hydrogenation process of in-situ-produced CO via the RWGS route because the reaction results showed no catalytic activity over CAZ-1 in the CO hydrogenation process under the same reaction conditions (Supplementary Table
3
). For CAZ-15 catalyst, the CH
3
OH signal located at 1,007 cm
−1
was detected during the in situ DRIFT test
66
, which indicated the process of CH
3
OH formation was strongly promoted on CAZ-15 due to the quantity of active sites for CH
3
OH synthesis (Supplementary Fig.
25
). In fact, the CO
2
adsorption capacity of the catalysts was not significantly changed by only increasing the loading of copper species, because CAZ-1 and CAZ-15 had similar adsorption modes and adsorption amounts for CO
2
(
\(3.0\,{\mathrm{mmol}}\,{\mathrm{g}}_{\mathrm{cat}}^{-1}\)
in CAZ-1,
\(2.9\,{\mathrm{mmol}}\,{\mathrm{g}}_{\mathrm{cat}}^{-1}\)
in CAZ-15; Supplementary Fig.
26
). It was concluded that the increase in methanol production rate was not affected by the adsorption capacity in these two catalysts, but was mainly caused by the different numbers of active sites. An increased copper loading of 15 wt% resulted in the absorption of intermediate species on the surface of CAZ-15 being much more complex than that on CAZ-1. In addition to the adsorbed bicarbonate (1,621, 1,225 cm
−1
), carbonate (1,247, 1,324, 1,455, 1,505 cm
−1
), formate (1,360, 1,384, 2,864, 2,974 cm
−1
) and methoxy species (1,070, 1,146, 2,836, 2,921 cm
−1
), carboxylate signals were also captured at 1,287 and 1,756 cm
−1
(ref.
67
). The formation of CH
3
OH was accompanied by the RWGS reaction because more complex active copper sites (single-atom, cluster and particle) were provided by the reaction, leading to a decrease in CH
3
OH selectivity. As for CMZ-15 with large copper nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig.
27
), all the absorbed species were CO
3
* or HCO
3
* but no further hydrogenation intermediates were observed, demonstrating that these large nanoparticles could not produce the further hydrogenation of carbonate at low temperature, which corresponded to the results of activity testing.

Based on the above information, intensity–time shift spectra supplied the dynamic behaviour of intermediates converting on CAZ-1 and CAZ-15 in the reaction (Fig.
6b
). The peaks at 2,877 and 2,935 cm
−1
in CAZ-1 and at 2,864 and 2,921 cm
−1
in CAZ-15 were chosen to study the dynamic evolution of CH
3
O* and HCOO* under reaction conditions (180 °C, 3 MPa). The ratio of HCOO*/CH
3
O* increased over both CAZ-1 and CAZ-15 catalysts with longer reaction times, indicating that the transformation process of HCOO* to CH
3
O* was the rate-limiting step compared to the HCOO*-generating process in the synthesis of CH
3
OH from CO
2
. Furthermore, the rate of increase of HCOO*/CH
3
O* on CAZ-15 was much slower than that on CAZ-1, suggesting that the consumption of HCOO* species would be faster on the surface of CAZ-15. Because the relative rates of HCOO* formation and its further conversion to CH
3
O* were the same for each Cu
1
–O
3
site in producing methanol over CAZ-1 and CAZ-15, the only reason to explain the different rates of increase of HCOO*/CH
3
O* over these two catalysts is that CAZ-15 contains more different types of active copper sites for HCOO* conversion reactions, such as HCOO* → CO.
The excellent selectivity to CH
3
OH of CAZ-1 could be attributed to its unique Cu
1
–O
3
catalytic centre as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The structure of Cu
1
O

on amorphous ZrO
2
(Cu

) surface was obtained by using stochastic surface walking (SSW) global optimization based on global neural network potential (SSW-NN) simulation to explore the global potential energy surface of the Cu
1
O
1
/ZrO
2
system. The stability energy of Cu
1
O
1
on a-ZrO
2
was −1.53 eV, much lower than that on ZrO
2
flat (111) and terrace (112) surfaces, which have stability energies of 1.10 and 0.17 eV that point to high thermodynamic stability (Supplementary Fig.
28a–c
). The most stable structure of Cu
1
O
1
on amorphous ZrO
2
showed a special Cu
1
–O
3
quasiplanar configuration with Cu–O bond distances of 1.814, 1.920 and 1.921 Å (Supplementary Fig.
29
), which agreed well with the EXAFS results. Moreover, the large oxygen vacancy formation energy of 3.7 eV on Cu
1
O
1
/a-ZrO
2
indicated the absence of O
v
, further proving that the amorphous ZrO
2
surface can anchor and stabilize isolated copper atoms (Supplementary Fig.
28c
). Electronic structure analysis showed that these isolated copper atoms existed in the form of Cu
2+
cation (Supplementary Table
8
), consistent with the experimental XANES results before and after the reaction. When the Cu
1
O
1
/a-ZrO
2
was exposed to the reaction atmosphere with reductive H
2
gas, a hydrogen atom can strongly adsorb on an oxygen atom near a copper atom with the adsorption energy of −1.76 eV. This led to the reduction of Cu
2+
to the Cu
δ
+
(1 <
δ
< 2) cation (Supplementary Table
8
), consistent with the in situ XAS results during the reaction process (Fig.
3d
). Therefore, the Cu
δ
+
cation was used as the active site to explore the mechanism of the CO
2
reduction process.
Figure

and Supplementary Figs.
30
and
31
show the calculated lowest-energy pathway for CO
2
hydrogenation, which involves HCOO*, H
2
COO* and CH
3
O* key intermediates. The reaction started with the dissociative adsorption of an H
2
molecule on a Cu–O pair to form Cu–H and OH groups (Supplementary Fig.
32
), which was endothermic at 0.57 eV. The dissociation energy barrier of H
2
is 0.61 eV. A CO
2
molecule was adsorbed physically near the Cu–H group, resulting in a free-energy change of 0.64 eV. While there were two possible channels for CO
2
hydrogenation, that is, to HCOO* or to COOH*, our calculations showed that the formation of the COOH* group had a high barrier of 0.43 eV, but the formation of HCOO* was nearly barrierless (0.08 eV). Thermodynamically, the COOH* group was also 0.39 eV less stable than the HCOO* group. The formed HCOO* adopted a bidentate configuration with two oxygen ends linking with the zirconium and copper atoms at distances of 2.20 and 1.85 Å, respectively. This indicated that the HCOO* pathway was the only viable route for CO
2
hydrogenation.

After HCOO* formation, a second H
2
molecule dissociated on the copper and the neighbouring two-coordinated surface oxygen with an endothermic energy of 0.61 eV. The C atom of the HCOO* group could then be hydrogenated to CH
2
OO* group with a barrier of 0.70 eV and a reaction energy of 0.22 eV. After that, CH
2
OO* could easily pick up the neighbouring hydrogen atom to form CH
2
OOH* with a barrier of only 0.01 eV. The CH
2
OOH* could further break the C–O bond to form CH
2
O* and hydroxyl groups by overcoming a barrier of 1.08 eV. The generated hydroxyl groups could react with the neighbouring hydrogen atom to form a water molecule with a reaction barrier of 1.04 eV and a reaction energy of 0.50 eV. The water molecule could desorb readily (exothermic by 0.15 eV). CH
2
O* could stepwisely react with neighbouring hydrogen atoms to form CH
3
O* and CH
3
OH*. The reaction barriers for these two hydrogenation steps were 0.13 and 0.70 eV with the reaction energies being −1.66 and 0.63 eV, respectively. The desorption of CH
3
OH would further release 0.57 eV energy.
Having established the overall reaction profiles, we can now determine the reaction rate of CO
2
hydrogenation on an isolated Cu
δ
+
cation site based on microkinetics simulation. Our microkinetics numerical simulation results are shown in Fig.
7b
. At the steady state, the dominant reaction intermediates on the surface were HCOO* species, the concentration of which increased from 0 to 0.8 with increasing time. This proved that the consumption of HCOO* species was the rate-determining step, a finding that is consistent with the in-situ DRIFT spectroscopy. At 180 °C, the calculated TOF for CO
2
hydrogenation to CH
3
OH on an isolated Cu
δ
+
cation was around 2.89 h
−1
, which was about two orders of magnitude larger than the CO
2
hydrogenation to CO (0.03 h
−1
), as illustrated in Fig.
7c
, and the selectivity of CO
2
hydrogenation to methanol was near 100%. The theoretical TOF for CO
2
hydrogenation to methanol was quite close to the experimental TOF value (1.37 h
−1
).
Based on the above results, we can establish a reaction model for CO
2
hydrogenation over the CAZ-
x
series catalysts, as shown in Fig.
8
. When the copper species is distributed in a single-atom level with uniform Cu
1
–O

catalytic centres on the surface of ZrO
2
, CO
2
is converted to methanol with 100% selectivity. When the copper species exists in the form of clusters or small nanoparticles, CO
2
can only produce unwanted CO. As the copper species is in larger particles, CO
2
is hard to activate and there is almost no catalytic activity. Under typical catalytic conditions, the Cu
1
–O
3
sites in copper single atoms and the copper clusters/small nanoparticles in combination contribute to methanol and CO synthesis from CO
2
hydrogenation, while the larger copper particles are not active sites for CO

hydrogenation.

Conclusions
This work reveals the strong dependence of CO
2
hydrogenation activity and selectivity on the nature of surface copper species for Cu/ZrO
2
catalysts. The undercoordinated cationic Cu
1
–O
3
species accumulate dynamically on the catalyst surface, forming stable active sites during the catalysis process, and achieving high selectivity to CH
3
OH (100%) in CO
2
hydrogenation at 180 °C. The copper single-atom catalyst can dissociate hydrogen readily with the help of nearby oxygen atoms and activate CO
2
to generate HCOO*, a key intermediate in CH
3
OH synthesis. The HCOO* pathway is the only viable route for CO
2
hydrogenation on the isolated Cu
1
–O
3
active sites. In contrast, small copper clusters and/or nanoparticles are active sites for CO formation via the RWGS route, while large copper particles barely activate CO
2
at low temperatures. The characteristic geometry and unique activity revealed in the copper single-atom catalyst provide a deep understanding of copper-catalysed CO
2
hydrogenation, and will guide future applications of single-atom catalysts in thermal catalytic CO
2
transformations.

CO
3
was weighed and dissolved in 100 ml deionized water to make a 0.06 M solution (solution B). After dissolution was complete, a peristaltic pump was used to slowly drip the two solutions A and B into another beaker containing 100 ml of deionized water at a rate of 0.3 ml min
−1
. Throughout the dropping process, the mixture was stirred at 350 rpm while heating at 80 °C. Once the dropping was complete, stirring was stopped and the flocculent precipitate that had formed was aged at 80 °C for 2 h. After ageing, it was cooled to room temperature and washed with deionized water to pH 7, followed by drying in an oven at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the blue solid sample was ground into powder and calcined in a muffle furnace by heating at 2 °C min
−1
to 350 °C over 5 h.
Catalyst characterization
The actual loading of copper in different catalysts was determined by ICP-OES performed on an iCAP 7000 (Thermo Fisher). The test method was as follows: 10 mg of sample was dissolved in a mixed solution (2 ml HNO
3
+ 6 ml HCl+2 ml HF) overnight, then added to a 50 ml volumetric flask and diluted to the scale line. Four internal copper concentration standard solutions (1, 10, 50, 100 ppm) were analysed and used to create a standard curve (
R
2
> 0.9999) before testing all samples. X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (scan angle, 10°–90°; scan speed, 2° min
−1
; voltage, 40 kV; current, 40 mA). The Raman spectroscopy data were collected on a Thermo Fisher DXR2xi with a 532 nm light source. In situ X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out on a Rigaku Ultima 4 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) in the temperature range of 10°–80 °C with a scanning step length of 0.33 under a hydrogen atmosphere (30 ml min
−1
). The curves were recorded at 30, 180, 230, 300 and 350 °C. The morphology and elemental mapping of catalysts were measured on a JEM ARM200F thermal-field emission microscope with a probe spherical aberration (Cs) corrector working at 200 kV, and by TEM (FEI Talos F200S G2) at 200 kV. The H
2
-TPR curves of samples were collected with an AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyser (Micromeritics) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Helium at 30 ml min
−1
was used to pretreat the samples at 250 °C for 2 h to remove moisture from the surface. Then 10% H
2
/He was passed into the reactor, with the temperature increasing at 10 °C min
−1
to 700 °C, and data were recorded every 0.5 min. H
2
-TPD curves of samples were also collected on an AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyser (Micromeritics). The samples were first pretreated at 300 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min
−1
in helium for 30 min, and then cooled to room temperature and further saturated by 10% H
2
/Ar for 30 min. After purging the physically adsorbed hydrogen on the surface with helium at 50 °C for 1 h, the temperature was slowly increased to 750 °C and the thermal conductivity detector signal recorded at the same time. CO
2
-TPD measurements were performed in the same way as for H
2
-TPD except that 5% CO
2
was used as the adsorption gas.
XPS and AES data were collected on an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectroscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (200 W,
E
= 1,486.6 eV). The binding energy of all samples was calibrated to the C 1

The ex situ and in situ XAS experiments were performed at beamline BL14W1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) in fluorescence mode with a Si(111) monochromator. A Lytle detector and a silicon solid detector were used to collect ex situ and in situ XAS data, respectively. At the same time, a 6 μm nickel filter was used to filter the signal. A copper foil was taken as a reference sample and measured for energy-calibration purposes (
E
0
= 8,979 eV). The first maximum point of the first-order derivative of the XANES was defined as
E
0
. For ex situ experiments, Cu K-edge spectra were collected at room temperature (25 °C). The CAZ-1, CAZ-1-U, CAZ-15 and CMZ-15 samples were pressed into pellets without any dilution. The in situ testing for CAZ-1 catalyst was performed by using a reactor with a beryllium window. Multiple repeated scans (
∼
20 min for each scan) were applied to achieve high data quality. Multiple data scans were collected and merged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. A K-type thermocouple was placed in contact with the catalyst bed to control the temperature, and the flow rate of the gas was controlled by multiple flow controllers. CAZ-1 sample was first pressed into a 1.5 cm disc, then placed in a cell for pretreatment at 230 °C under an argon gas flow (30 ml min
−1
) for 2 h. The temperature was then lowered to 180 °C and the gas changed to CO
2
/H
2
(25/75, 10 ml min
−1
). After the pressure was stabilized at 1 MPa, the continuous spectrum was collected. EXAFS data processing (including calibration, merge, and analysis) was done with Athena/Artemis software packages
68
, based on FEFF6. Bond length (
R
), Debye-Waller factor (
σ
2
), amplitude factor (
\(S_0^2\)
) and energy shift (Δ
E
0
) were used to optimize the fitting results. The WT was performed with the HAMA Fortran package (
http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Experiments/CRG/BM20/Software/Wavelets/HAMA
). In a typical WT analysis,
k
weight
= 2, and the Morlet function was used, with
κ
= 10,
σ
= 1.
DRIFT-CO chemisorption measurements were carried on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a mercury–cadmium–telluride detector and a Harrick reaction cell. The sample was first treated in an argon atmosphere (30 ml min
−1
) at 300 °C for 30 min, then cooled to 30 °C for background collection. After that, 10% CO/Ar was passed through the sample until the adsorption was saturated, then the 10% CO/Ar was cut off and the desorption spectra recorded as 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm
−1
under an argon purge. In situ DRIFT experiments at high pressure (3 MPa) were measured on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker Vertex 70) with a mercury–cadmium–telluride detector and a Harrick reaction cell. The samples were first pretreated with helium at 230 °C or hydrogen at 250 °C for 60 min, then cooled to 150 °C and treated with CO
2
/H
2
/Ar (24/72/4) or CO
2
alone. After the pressure reached 3 MPa the background was collected. Finally, the temperature was raised to 180 °C and the spectra recorded over the absorption time.
TOF-SIMS experiments were tested on a PHI nano TOF II with Bi
3
+
as the ion species. The energy, ion current, raster size, mass range, mode and analysis time for each test were 30 keV, 2 nA, 100 μm × 100 μm, 0–1,850 μg/L, high mass resolution mode and 5 min, respectively.
The H
2
–D
2
exchange experiments were carried out in a flow reactor at 180 °C, and the formation rate of the HD product was measured by the mass signal intensity (ionic current). First, 0.1 g sample was pretreated for 1 h in different (30 ml min
−1
) atmospheres (pure a-ZrO
2
, CAZ-1-U, CAZ-15-U and pure Q50 were pretreated at 230 °C with argon, CMZ-15 was pretreated at 250 °C with hydrogen), followed by passing a mixture of D
2
and H
2
(10 ml min
−1
) through the sample. The reaction products H
2
, D
2
and HD were analysed by mass spectrometry (OmniStar). The mass-to-charge ratios using H
2
, D
2
and HD are 2, 4 and 3, respectively.
Catalytic evaluation
The catalytic performance of all catalysts was tested on a high-pressure, continuous-flow, fixed-bed reactor built by Xiamen Better Works Engineering. We mixed 500 mg of CAZ-
x
catalysts (40–60 mesh) with 2 g of quartz sand (40–60 mesh) and pretreated this mixture in an argon atmosphere at 230 °C (CAZ-1-r was reduced by H
2
at 370 °C) in a flow of 30 ml min
−1
for 10 h. CMZ-15 and CS-15 were pretreated with hydrogen at 250 °C in a flow of 30 ml min
−1
for 10 h. The temperature was then cooled to 180 °C, and CO
2
/H
2
/Ar (24/72/4, 3 MPa) was introduced. After the pressure and temperature stabilized, the gas flow was changed to 10 ml min
−1
and a Shimadzu chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a thermal conductivity detector was used to analyse products online every 30 min. The catalytic performance of catalysts was evaluated in terms of CO
2
conversion, product selectivity, TOF and space-time yield (STY). The computational formulas were as follows:
$$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2\,{{{\mathrm{conversion}}}},C_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\left( \% \right) = \frac{{X_{\mathrm{{CO}_{2},in}} - X_{\mathrm{{CO}_{2},out}}}}{{X_{\mathrm{{CO}_{2},in}}}} \times 100\% } \end{array}$$
(1)
$$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{{\mathrm{Product}}}}\,(i)\,{{{\mathrm{selectivity}}}},{\mathrm{Sel}}_i\% = \frac{{R_i \times f_{i,{\mathrm{m}}}}}{{\mathop {\sum }\nolimits_i R_i \times f_{i,{\mathrm{m}}}}} \times 100\% } \end{array}$$

(3)
$$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{{\mathrm{STY}}}}\,{{{\mathrm{of}}}}\,{{{\mathrm{methanol,}}}}\,{\mathrm{STY}}_{\mathrm{CH}_{3}{\rm{OH}}}\left( {{\mathrm{mmol}}_{\mathrm{CH}_{3}{\rm{OH}}} \, {\mathrm{g}}_{\mathrm{cat}}^{ - 1} \, {\mathrm{h}}^{ - 1}} \right) = \frac{{F_{\mathrm{{CO}_{2},{\rm{in}}}} \times C_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \times {\mathrm{Sel}}_{\mathrm{CH}_{3}{\rm{OH}}} \times 1,000}}{{W_{\mathrm{cat}}}}} \end{array}$$

DFT calculations
The reaction profiles were calculated using plane-wave DFT calculations as implemented in VASP
69
, where electron–ion interaction was represented by the projector-augmented wave pseudopotential
70
,
71
. The exchange functional utilized was the spin-polarized GGA-PBE
72
and the kinetic energy cut-off was set as 450 eV. The first Brillion zone
k
-point sampling utilizes only the gamma-point since the supercell was rather large, which was shown to provide converged energetics. The energy and force criterion for convergence of the electron density and structure optimization were set at 10
−5
eV and 0.05 eV Å
−1
, respectively.
SSW-NN simulation
The active site structure was resolved by the machine-learning-based fast global potential energy surface (PES) exploration using the SSW method as implemented in LASP code
73
. The PES of the catalyst system (containing elements Cu, Zr, O and H) was described by the global neural network (G-NN) potential, which was generated by iteratively self-learning the global PES dataset from SSW exploration. In the past few years, the SSW-NN method has been successfully applied in solving the structures of complex systems, including oxide
13
,
74
,
75
, zeolite
74
and molecule crystals
76
. The procedure for SSW-NN simulation is briefly summarized below.
First, the global dataset was built iteratively during the self-learning of the G-NN potential. These PES data came initially from the DFT-based SSW simulation and were then amended by G-NN-based SSW PES exploration. To cover all the likely compositions of the four-element Cu–Zr–O–H systems, SSW simulations were performed starting from different types of structures (including bulk, layer and cluster), compositions and atom numbers per supercell. Overall, these SSW simulations generated more than 10
7
structural configurations on the PES and a fraction of these were selected as the dataset to be computed by high-accuracy DFT calculations. The final dataset of the Cu–Zr–O–H G-NN potential contains 60,271 structures, as detailed in Supplementary Table
9
.
Second, a final G-NN potential was trained on the global dataset using the method introduced in our previous work
77
,
78
. To achieve a high accuracy for PES, we adopted a large set of power-type structure descriptors, which contained 324 descriptors for every element, including 148 two-body, 170 three-body and 6 four-body descriptors, and compatibly, the neural network had two hidden layers (324-50-50-1 net) each with 50 neurons and one output layer with one neuron, equivalent to 75,000 network parameters in total. Minimum–maximum scaling was utilized to normalize the training data sets. Hyperbolic tangent activation functions were used for the hidden layers, while a linear transformation was applied to the output layer of all networks. The limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno method was used to minimize the loss function to match DFT energy, force and stress. The final energy and force criterions of the r.m.s. errors of the G-NN potential were 6.0 meV per atom and 0.151 eV Å
−1
, respectively. The NN potential of CuZrOH.pot can be found at
www.lasphub.com/supportings/CuZrOH.pot
.
Finally, SSW-NN global optimization was utilized to obtain a reasonable model of Cu
SAC
on amorphous ZrO
2
by exhaustively searching the phase space of Cu
1
O
1
/ZrO
2
. The model was built as follows:
1.
From the most stable monoclinic ZrO
2
bulk structure, the most stable (−111) surface in a
p
(4 × 4) supercell was cleaved that contains three ZrO
2
layers with 144 atoms (48 ZrO
2
formula units).
2.
To create defects, three ZrO
2
formula units (nine atoms) were artificially removed from the m-ZrO
2
(−111) surface, and utilized to represent the locally amorphous structure (Supplementary Fig.
33
).
3.
One CuO formula unit (two atoms) was randomly added at the ZrO
2
defect sites.
4.
Starting from the Cu
1
O
1
/ZrO
2
model, more than 10,000 minima were explored by SSW-NN simulation. From that, the most stable structure of Cu
1
O
1
on amorphous ZrO
2
was obtained, which featured a special Cu
1
–O
3
quasiplanar configuration decorated at the ZrO
2
defect sites. This structure had Cu–O bond distances of 1.814, 1.920 and 1.921 Å (Supplementary Fig.
29
), which were very consistent with the EXAFS results. The stable structures were then verified by DFT calculations and then adopted for further computing the CO
2
hydrogenation pathway.
