Heterogeneous catalysis
Abstract
The surface structure of heterogeneous catalysts is closely associated with their catalytic performance. Current efforts for structural modification mainly focus on improving the catalyst synthesis details. Here we reveal an induced activation strategy to manipulate the catalyst surface reconstruction process by controlling the composition of reducing agents at the activation stage. Exposing the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al

Main
The dynamic structural evolution of heterogeneous catalysts at different stages of their lives (that is, activation, reaction and deactivation) is a common phenomenon that has received much attention
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
. For many catalysts, pretreatments are required to transform the catalytic inactive component to an active state. These treatments typically involve reduction to form metallic nanoparticles or partially reduced metal oxides
6
, sulfidation to form metal sulfides
7
or carbonization to form metal carbides
8
. At the initial reaction stage, the active sites may undergo further modifications in response to the reaction environment. For instance, metal oxides may migrate onto other locations, and metallic nanoparticles may refacet or flatten
9
. In addition, catalysts slowly evolve during the reaction, associated with phase transformation
10
, sintering
11
, decomposition into single atoms
12
or hetero-atom depositions
13
. These structural changes are typically detrimental to the catalytic performance and can ultimately lead to catalyst deactivation.

15

19
and the methanol steam reforming (MSR) reaction
20
. However, a major disadvantage of this catalyst is that the active metallic copper nanoparticles are prone to sintering due to the low Tammann temperature of copper (407 °C)
21
. Previous studies have revealed that zinc oxides can interact with metallic copper nanoparticles by migrating onto their surfaces
16
,
18
. Such a phenomenon, known as the strong metal–support interaction (SMSI), results in surface modification of the metal sites
15
,
16
and retards the sintering of copper nanoparticles as well
22
. Studies have claimed that the kinetics of the SMSI phenomena are particle-size dependent and become sluggish for large nanoparticles in most cases
23
,
24
. Therefore, the relative kinetics of copper sintering and zinc oxide migration play an essential role in determining the catalyst structural evolution.
Herein, we reveal that the SMSI kinetics of the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al

mixture at elevated temperatures. This finding intrigued us and led us to develop a method to optimize the catalyst structure via controlling the composition of the reducing agents at the catalyst activation stage. Migration of ZnO
x
onto the surface of Cu nanoparticles can be precisely manipulated and optimized, leading to improved activity and stability towards the MSR as the model reaction. Moreover, the formation mechanism and essential role of Cu–ZnO
x
interfacial sites for enhanced catalytic performance are elucidated with a series of in situ characterization studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a facile approach to improve the catalytic performance of the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al

catalyst by changing the activation conditions.
Results
Effect of activation procedures on the MSR performance
The commercial Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
catalyst was subjected to different activation treatments at 300 °C and subsequently evaluated for the MSR reaction at 225 °C. The resulting catalysts are denoted as CuZnAl-H, which is reduced in a H
2
/N
2
mixture (30 sccm) for 1 h; CuZnAl-H′, which is reduced in a H
2
/N
2
mixture (30 sccm) for 2 h; CuZnAl-R10, which is reduced in a H

2
mixture (30 sccm) for 1 h; and CuZnAl-U, which has no reduction pretreatment. There is an induction period (~1 h) upon the initiation of the MSR reaction, possibly related to the long stabilization time required by the vaporizer to generate a steady reactant flow (Supplementary Figs.
1
–
3
). For CuZnAl-H, the methanol conversion (
C
MeOH
) maximizes at 60.1% and progressively decreases to 55.1% after the 8 h reaction (Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Table
1
). Without an activation pretreatment at 300 °C, sluggish reduction of CuO can also occur during the reaction. The corresponding CuZnAl-U catalyst exhibits almost identical activities but requires a three-times-longer induction time (~3 h), which is undesirable for industrial purposes (Supplementary Fig.
4
). The slight loss of activity after a longer elapsed time during the reaction is mainly a consequence of sintering of the Cu nanoparticles, as confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), showing an increased average particle size from 12.5 to 17.3 nm (Supplementary Fig.
5a,b
and Supplementary Note
1
). A longer reduction time at higher-than-reaction temperatures aggravates particle sintering, resulting in decreased conversion for the CuZnAl-H′ catalyst

Surprisingly, both the activity and stability of the catalyst during the MSR reaction are improved after exposure to a H

mixture at 300 °C. Methanol conversion over CuZnAl-R10 reaches 67.0% with a negligible decay of 2.2% within 8 h. Also, STEM–EDS characterization reveals negligible changes in the copper particle sizes after reaction (12.4 nm; Supplementary Fig.
5c,d
). Such an activity enhancement becomes even more apparent at greater weight hour space velocity (WHSV) values with fewer diffusion limitations (Fig.
1b
). The turnover frequency (TOF), calculated based on Cu sites determined by the N
2
O reactive frontal chromatography (N
2
O-RFC), is found to be twofold higher for CuZnAl-R10 than for CuZnAl-H at the WHSV of MeOH of 60 h
–1
. During the activation, excessive exposure to the H
2
/H
2
O/CH
3
OH/N
2
mixture suppresses the reactivity: the CuZnAl-R60 catalyst exhibits a lower conversion of 64.8–61.7%. After catalysing the MSR reaction for 40 h, 90% of the initial activity is preserved for CuZnAl-R10, whereas the activity of CuZnAl-H decays by ~35% (Fig.
1c
). Moreover, the robustness of CuZnAl-R10 was evaluated by passivating the catalyst in 1%-O
2
/Ar for 30 min at room temperature and then exposing it to air for 3 h. The treated catalyst shows almost identical MSR activity to the as-activated CuZnAl-R10 catalyst (Supplementary Fig.
6
). These findings imply that varying the activation procedures of the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
catalyst can result in an irreversible structural transformation. Note that ZnO must be involved in such a reconstruction, as the supported Cu/Al
2
O
3
catalyst activated by different procedures shows almost identical activities (Supplementary Fig.
7
) and morphologies (Supplementary Fig.
8
).
Physical and chemical natures of catalyst surface after activation
Morphologies and structures of CuZnAl-H, CuZnAl-R10 and CuZnAl-R60 were investigated to understand the origin of their distinct MSR performances. All the catalysts have similar specific surface areas (68–69 m
2
g
–1
) and porosities (volume, 0.14–0.17 cm
3
g
–1
; average pore diameter, 6.4–7.3 nm), reflecting their overall structural robustness (Supplementary Figs.
9
and
10
and Supplementary Table
2
). In situ X-ray diffraction analysis reveals a complete transformation of bulk CuO to metallic Cu
0
after different activation treatments (Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
11
). The average crystallite sizes of the Cu
0
nanoparticles, based on the Cu(111) peak, are found to be ~12.5 nm. STEM–EDS results also reveal nearly identical average particle sizes for all three activated catalysts (Supplementary Fig.
5
). However, exposing the catalyst to the H
2
/H
2
O/CH
3
OH/N
2
mixture during activation decreases the copper dispersions as determined by N
2
O-RFC, which follow the trend of CuZnAl-H (20.7 ± 0.4%) > CuZnAl-R10 (16.7 ± 0.3%) > CuZnAl-R60 (13.0 ± 0.2%; Supplementary Fig.
12
). It has been reported that the formation of CuZn alloy should lead to an increase in the Cu dispersion measured by N
2
O-RFC
17
, and the SMSI phenomenon results in decreased dispersion values due to the partial coverage of Cu by an oxide overlayer
26
. Our data suggest that the latter situation might occur during the catalyst activation under a H

mixture.
The nature of active sites for the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al
2

3
catalyst has been debated for decades, and two distinct structures were proposed, including ZnO
x
migration onto metallic Cu
3
,
15
and CuZn alloy formation
27
,
28
. Formation of CuZn alloys, usually evidenced by X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis
29
,
30
, requires high temperatures of over 300 °C or high pressures over 5 MPa (Supplementary Table
3
)
28
,
29
,
30
,
31
. Consequently, the alloy structure has never been reported for Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
in the MSR reaction but only in the methanol synthesis reaction, which requires much harsher conditions. Notably, the Zn K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure of CuZnAl-R10 (Supplementary Fig.
13a
) is distinct from metallic Zn but well aligned with its oxide state. Moreover, the linear combination fitting of the CuZnAl-R10 X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectrum according to the ZnO and Zn foil reference shows that Zn is predominantly present in an oxide state (Supplementary Fig.
13b
). The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (Supplementary Fig.
13c
) and wavelet transformation extended X-ray absorption fine structure oscillations (Supplementary Fig.
13d
) of CuZnAl-R10 also show no features for the Zn–Zn or Zn–Cu bonds, which both theoretically appear at ~2.2 Å, evidencing the absence of metallic Zn or CuZn alloys after activation
30
.
Aberration-corrected STEM was further utilized for atomic-scale structure characterization. Particularly, the catalyst was activated, and all the samples were prepared in a glove box under an Ar atmosphere and then transferred to a transmission electron microscope using a vacuum transfer holder to eliminate air exposure, which might change the valence states of Cu and Zn. High-angle annular dark-field STEM images and the corresponding EDS elemental maps of the fresh catalyst (CuZnAl-U), synthesized using a coprecipitation method, show a mixture of Cu oxides and Zn oxides (Supplementary Fig.
14
). CuZnAl-H contains discrete ZnO and Cu nanoparticles (Fig.
2a
and Supplementary Fig.
15
) with minimal SMSI phenomena. However, activating the catalysts with the H
2
/H
2
O/CH

2
mixture initiates obvious dynamic reconstructions at the ZnO–Cu interface. For the CuZnAl-R10 catalyst with 10 min exposure to the reactive mixture, while ZnO nanoparticles are still present, a thin overlayer starts to form on the Cu nanoparticle surface (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Fig.
16
). Elongating the exposure time to 1 h leads to densification of the Zn-containing overlayer to reach a thickness of 1–2 nm (Fig.
2e
and Supplementary Fig.
17
). The surface reconstruction process is also visualized by in situ aberration-corrected STEM analysis. Cu/ZnO/Al

contains Cu nanoparticles with a pristine surface after exposure to 60%-H
2

2
(Supplementary Fig.

). An encapsulation overlayer occurs only after switching inlet gas to a H

/H

mixture (Supplementary Fig.
18c
). Furthermore, the thickness of such an overlayer increases with a longer exposure time (Supplementary Fig.

).

Moreover, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was performed to identify the valance states of Cu, Zn and O. Three representative regions were selected for every catalyst: region no. 1 on the ZnO nanoparticle (blue points), region no. 2 at the interface between the overlayer and the Cu nanoparticle (red points) and region no. 3 on the Cu nanoparticles (black points). For CuZnAl-H (Fig.
2b
), EELS spectrum no. 1 shows an obvious Zn L edge and O K edge that are characteristic of zinc oxides (Supplementary Figs.
19
and
20
)
32
,
33
, while spectrum no. 3 shows a strong Cu L edge with negligible O K edge, illustrating the presence of metallic copper
34
,
35
. Similarly, for CuZnAl-R10 (Fig.
2d
) and CuZnAl-R60 (Fig.
2f
), spectra no. 1 and no. 3 show zinc oxides and metallic copper, respectively. More importantly, the spectra collected at region no. 2 reveal the critical information at the Cu–ZnO
x
interface of CuZnAl-R10 (Fig.
2d
) and CuZnAl-R60 (Fig.
2f
). The Cu L edge, Zn L edge and O K edge were simultaneously identified, and these signals are assigned to Cu

< 2) and oxygen from ZnO-like species, respectively
32
,
34
,
35
,
36

37
(Supplementary Note

). Summarizing the above microscopy and EELS results, the overlayer on metallic Cu nanoparticles in CuZnAl-R10 and CuZnAl-R60 is ZnO
x
species, with Zn
δ
+
species at the Cu–ZnO
x
interface due to the inductive and reduction effects and Zn
2+
species inside the ZnO
x
. The presence of Cu

and Zn
δ

sites further rules out the possibility of CuZn alloy formation
17
,
27
.
Quantification of the Cu–ZnO
x
sites
Quasi in situ (that is, vacuum transfer after pretreatment without exposing to air) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis provides additional insights into the near-surface structure of the Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
catalysts (Supplementary Note
3
). After activation, a complete reduction of copper occurs, as evidenced by the disappearance of Cu
2+
satellite peaks and the shift of the Cu 2
p
bands to lower binding energies (Supplementary Fig.
21a
). The atomic ratio between Cu and Zn follows the order of CuZnAl-H (1.02 ± 0.2) > CuZnAl-R10 (0.92 ± 0.2) > CuZnAl-R60 (0.65 ± 0.2; Supplementary Table
4
), consistent with the progressive enrichment of ZnO
x
onto the copper surface with increasing exposure time to the H
2
/H
2
O/CH
3
OH/N
2
mixture during activation. The Auger parameter of Cu for the unreduced catalyst is different from that of the activated ones (Supplementary Table
5
), evidencing a mixture of Cu
0
and Cu
+
in the activated Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
catalysts
38
,
39
. Besides, the Auger parameters of Zn for the activated Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
catalysts show almost the same value as that of CuZnAl-U, which indicates that most of the Zn species in the activated catalysts are still present as Zn
2+
. The Cu and Zn LMM Auger spectra resolve Cu
0
(918.2–918.3 eV) and Cu
+
(916.2–916.3 eV) as well as Zn
2+
(988.9–989.0 eV) and Zn
δ
+
(991.3 eV) species (Fig.
3a,b
and Supplementary Fig.
22
)
16
,
17
. The absence of the Zn
0
signal in the Zn LMM Auger spectra again rules out the presence of CuZn alloys
27
. We quantify the atomic percentages of surface Cu
+
and Zn
δ
+
in CuZnAl-H to be 10.3% and 9.9%, respectively. The CuZnAl-R10 catalyst, with slight overlayer formation, contains increased amounts of Cu
+
(15.6%) and Zn
δ
+
(15.4%) in the near-surface region. However, excess exposure to the H
2
/H
2
O/CH
3
OH mixture slightly decreases the atomic percentages of Cu
+
and Zn
δ
+
to 14.5% and 14.3%, respectively, for CuZnAl-R60. This is possibly due to the presence of some dense ZnO
x
overlayers with a thickness beyond the probing depth of lab-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) with CO as the probe molecule at 25 °C provides additional insights into the relative abundance of interfacial sites on the catalyst’s topmost surface (Fig.
3c
). Two infrared bands at 2,104–2,106 cm
–1
and 2,094–2,098 cm
−1
are assigned to CO linearly bound to Cu
+
and Cu
0
, respectively
16
,
35
. And the band associated with surface CuZn alloy (~1,970 cm
–1
)
40
,
41
is not observed. The intensity of the Cu
0
–CO signal decreases gradually with the extent of surface ZnO
x
coverage on the Cu nanoparticles (Fig.
3c
). Nevertheless, the fraction of Cu
+
among all the Cu species follows the order of CuZnAl-R10 (79.3%) > CuZnAl-R60 (68.2%) > CuZnAl-H (42.3%; Fig.
3c
). Although a modest SMSI effect causes slight physical blockage of Cu
0
sites, the oxide overlayer formed by the SMSI effect is usually gas permeable, therefore maintaining abundant exposed Cu
+
sites at the metal–oxide interface
42
,
43
. For the CuZnAl-R60 catalyst, its dense overlayer may reduce the gas permeability and the number of accessible Cu
+
sites.
To unveil the essential role of Cu–ZnO
x
interfacial sites in determining the catalytic performance towards the MSR reaction, intrinsic activities were plotted against the number of Cu
+
and Zn
δ
+
sites, respectively. We obtain almost linear correlations between the TOF values and atomic percentages of Cu
+
and Zn
δ
+
from the quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results (Fig.
3d,e
) as well as the Cu
+
/(Cu
0
+ Cu
+
) ratio from the in situ CO DRIFTS results (Fig.
3f
). Such correlations explicitly demonstrate that the Cu–ZnO
x
interfacial sites are responsible for the improved activity. Exposure of the Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
catalyst to the H
2
/H
2
O/CH
3
OH/N
2
mixture for a reasonable time during activation introduces an optimum ZnO
x
overlayer (not too thick) with the greatest number of exposed Cu–ZnO
x
interfacial sites and the best catalytic performance. By contrast, the aggressive treatment creates a thick ZnO
x
overlayer that reduces the accessible Cu–ZnO
x
sites. The TOF of Cu/Al
2
O
3
(Supplementary Fig.
7b
) is much lower than that of Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
, further suggesting that ZnO plays a pivotal role in enhancing the MSR performance.
MSR reaction mechanism over Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
The MSR reaction pathway has been extensively investigated in the literature, with three putative pathways involving methyl formate (*H
3
COOCH), carbon monoxide (*CO) and formate (*CHOO) as the surface intermediates proposed for copper-based catalysts (Supplementary Scheme
1
)
44
,
45
,
46
,
47
,
48
. Recent theoretical and in situ DRIFTS studies support the route where surface methoxy species (*OCH
3
) sequentially transform to formaldehyde (*OCH
2
), methylene dioxygen (*CH
2
OO) and formate (*CHOO), with formate ultimately decompose to CO
2
and H
2
(refs.
45
,
49
). To elucidate the MSR reaction pathway over Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
, in situ temperature-programmed DRIFTS studies were undertaken. Adsorbed methanol (2,972, 2,915, 2,862, 2,817, 1,047 and 1,010 cm
–1
), water (1,650 and 3,367 cm
−1
) and surface methoxy species (2,937, 2,838 and 1,033 cm
−1
)
49
,
50
were present after the activated catalysts were exposed to a H
2
O/CH
3
OH/Ar mixture at 25 °C (Supplementary Fig.
23
). The catalysts were then flushed with Ar to remove weakly adsorbed molecules and heated to 250 °C at a constant rate of 5 °C min
–1
(Fig.
4a,c
and Supplementary Fig.
24a
). As the temperature increased, the surface methoxy species gradually disappeared, and new bands at 1,597–1,600 and 1,361 cm
–1
appeared from surface monodentate formate species (m-*CHOO)
49
. The in situ temperature-programmed DRIFTS results reveal that the reaction pathways over all three activated catalysts are similar and involve a *OCH
3
-to-*CHOO transformation (Fig.
4b,d
and Supplementary Fig.
24b
). Furthermore, the onset temperature for the conversion of surface methoxy species follows the trend of CuZnAl-R10 < CuZnAl-R60 < CuZnAl-H, which parallels the steady-state MSR activities (Supplementary Fig.
25
). Such a correlation suggests that the dehydrogenation of surface methoxy species is a slow step for the MSR reaction.

DFT calculations provide additional fundamental insights into the MSR reaction pathway over the copper-based catalysts. A Cu(111) surface, given its dominancy in X-ray diffraction patterns, was used to represent the Cu nanoparticles (Fig.

2
O dissociation (from 1.06 eV to 0.80 eV) are facilitated on the Cu–ZnO

site (Supplementary Tables

–

). Furthermore, the activation barriers for *CH

OOH formation, *HCOOH formation and *CHOO decomposition are also lowered. The DFT calculations thus indicate that the potential synergy at the Cu–ZnO

sites enhances the MSR reactivity mainly by accelerating the dehydrogenation of *CH

Adsorbate-induced SMSI during the activation of Cu/ZnO/Al

It is well known that the driving force for the SMSI effect is the tendency to lower the total energy of the system
53
. However, the mechanism of the accelerated SMSI between ZnO
x
and Cu nanoparticles in the presence of the MSR reactants is not fully understood. A variety of pretreatments were examined (H

), all of which yielded lower activities than those of the CuZnAl-H and CuZnAl-R10 catalysts (Supplementary Fig.

). Intrigued by recent efforts to define the adsorbate-induced structural changes for supported metal nanoparticles
43
,
53
,
54
, operando DRIFTS studies were performed to monitor the catalyst surface at the activation stage. Both methanol and adsorbed methoxy species are present during the activation by H

OH/N
2
at 300 °C (Supplementary Fig.
38a
). Note that intact methanol molecules can also adsorb on the catalyst surface as the *CH
3
OH species
55
. Therefore, surface *OCH
3
and *CH
3
OH might interact with the ZnO
x
species and facilitate their migrations on the metallic Cu
0
nanoparticles. Although the two species are also present during the activation with H
2
/CH
3
OH/N
2
, the absence of H
2
O leads to the formation of surface carbon deposits, as evidenced by the in situ Raman spectroscopy result (Supplementary Fig.
39b
), that may inhibit the interfacial reconstruction.
It is, however, challenging to elucidate such a promotion effect at an atomic level, even theoretically. Here, we propose a simplified alternative solution: to calculate the migration energy of the Zn
3
O

H

cluster on the Cu(111) surface. According to the free energy diagram of Zn
3
O
x
H
y
/Cu(111) in equilibrium with the gas environment, the Zn
3
O
2
H
2
cluster, containing both oxygen-saturated and oxygen-deficient Zn, still has the best thermodynamic stability during activation by the H
2
/H
2
O/CH
3
OH/N
2
mixture (Supplementary Fig.
40
). An activation environment that is more reductive than the reaction condition should have a higher chance of creating more oxygen-deficient Zn sites on the ZnO species. Migration of this almost axial symmetric Zn
3
O
2
H
2
cluster on the Cu(111) surface has two possible paths, with the energy barriers calculated to be 0.05 and 0.29 eV, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
41
). A cluster’s migration energy barrier is size dependent and, theoretically, should be much greater for a realistic model. Herein, we focused on the energetically more favourable path to relatively investigate the effect of adsorbed molecules.
Adsorption of *CH
3
OH and *OCH
3
on an oxygen-saturated Zn site dramatically increases the migration energy barrier to 0.24 eV and 0.18 eV, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
42b,c
). On the other hand, with the adsorption on an oxygen-deficient Zn site, the migration energy barrier of Zn
3
O
2
H
2
is increased to 0.35 eV by *OCH
3
(Supplementary Fig.
43c
) but reduced to 0.03 eV by *CH
3
OH (Supplementary Fig.
43b
). Water, adsorbed on either Zn site, has a negative effect on the migration of the Zn
3
O
2
H
2
cluster (Supplementary Figs.
42d
and
43d
). Overall, our calculations possibly suggest that the accelerated ZnO
x
migration on metallic Cu nanoparticles is attributed to the intact methanol molecules adsorbed on the oxygen-deficient Zn sites. Indeed, a reduction of the migration barrier from 0.05 eV without adsorbates to 0.03 eV with methanol is hardly significant, and it is also possible that the adsorbates induce reconstruction by facilitating the removal of Zn
x
O
y
fragments from ZnO at the Cu–ZnO interface. Such a phenomenon should be temperature dependent and even slowly occurs during the MSR reaction operating at a relatively lower temperature than the one adopted for the activation. However, the sluggish kinetics is unfavourable for forming the protective layer in time to compete with the sintering of Cu nanoparticles.
Conclusions
In summary, we propose a catalyst activation method, referred to as induced activation, to control the surface reconstruction process by tuning the composition of reducing agents. Exposing the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al
2
O
3
catalyst to a H
2
/H
2
O/CH
3
OH/N
2
mixture during activation accelerates the migration of ZnO
x
species onto the surface of metallic Cu
0
nanoparticles. Furthermore, a proper degree of encapsulation can be achieved by tuning the exposure time, improving both the catalyst stability and activity. The activity enhancement relates to the abundant Cu–ZnO
x
interfacial sites that exhibit faster kinetics for the *CH
3
O dehydrogenation and H
2
O dissociation. This study represents a conceptual advance to not only create an active phase but also modify the active surface sites at the atomic level during catalyst activation. Compared to designing catalytic materials with new compositions or synthesis protocols, optimizing the activation procedures is an additional alternative to yield more reactive and stable active sites that potentially enable broader industrial applications.

The mixture was aged overnight and filtered, with the precipitate dried at 100 °C for 12 h. The catalyst powders were finally calcined in static air at 450 °C for 4 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy surface analysis and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry confirmed the absence of residual Na in the catalyst.
Characterizations
N

adsorption–desorption isotherms of the samples were measured at –196 °C on a BELSORP-MAX apparatus. The sample was outgassed under vacuum at 200 °C for 3 h before N

adsorption. The total pore volume, average pore diameters and pore size distributions were obtained from the N

adsorption branches of isotherms using the Barret–Joyner–Halenda method.
The content of Cu was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (Agilent 725ES).
Temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H

Morphology and elemental distribution of the catalysts were analysed by aberration-corrected STEM operated on a ThermoFisher Themis Z transmission electron microscope equipped with two aberration correctors. High-angle annular dark-field STEM images were recorded using a convergence angle of 25 mrad and inner and outer collection angles of 59 and 200 mrad, respectively. EDS was carried out using four in-column Super-X detectors. EELS data were acquired using a Gatan Enfinium ER (model 977) EELS spectrometer with a dual EELS function. A pretreatment chamber was used for the catalyst activation treatments, and samples were prepared by dispersing the catalyst powder in ethanol, then adding it onto molybdenum grids supported with carbon films in a glove box under an Ar atmosphere. A vacuum transfer holder (Fischione Model 2550) was used to eliminate additional air exposure that might change the valence states of Cu and Zn.
The in situ atmospheric STEM experiment was performed using a Climate S3 in situ transmission electron microscope holder (DENS Solutions Company), allowing for in situ STEM observation under atmospheric pressure and high temperature. The CuZnAl-U catalyst was dispersed in the nanoreactor of the in situ holder. The catalyst was in situ reduced under 60%-H

In situ X-ray diffraction analysis was performed on a Bruker D8-Advance X-ray powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα ray source (wavelength,
λ
= 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. The catalyst was loaded into a customized in situ cell, heated up to 300 °C and activated in different conditions. The X-ray diffraction patterns were collected over a 2
θ
(angle between transmitted X-ray beam and reflected beam) range of 30–80° with a resolution of 0.02°.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements at the Zn K edge were performed at BL14W1 at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility using a transmission mode for Zn foil and a fluorescence mode for the Cu/ZnO/Al

catalysts. The electron beam energy was 3.5 GeV, and the stored current was 230 mA (top-up). A 38-pole wiggler with a maximum magnetic field of 1.2 T inserted in the straight section of the storage ring was used. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure data were collected using a fixed-exit double-crystal Si(111) monochromator. A Lytle detector was used to collect the fluorescence signal, and the energy was calibrated using Zn foil.
Quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectra were collected using a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (1,486.6 eV; pass energy, 20.0 eV). A pretreatment chamber was used for the catalyst activation treatments. Afterwards, the chamber was evacuated, and the sample was directly transferred into the vacuum analysis chamber to avoid exposure to air.
An in situ Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (PerkinElmer Frontier) equipped with a diffuse reflection cell (Harrick Praying Mantis) was used for in situ DRIFTS analysis. Spectra were collected with a spectral resolution of 4 cm
–1
, and each spectrum was the average of 32 scans. About 30 mg of the catalyst was placed into a customized reaction cell. The catalyst was first activated under different conditions at 300 °C. After cooling to 25 °C in an Ar atmosphere, the background was recorded. For in situ CO DRIFTS, 1.5 ml min

of 1%-CO/Ar, diluted in 28.5 ml min

of pure Ar, was fed to the cell for 30 min, and the spectrum was then collected. For in situ temperature-programmed DRIFTS, a mixture of methanol and water was introduced into the reactor by bubbling Ar through a saturator filled with liquid methanol/water. The samples were then heated to 250 °C at a rate of 5 °C min
−1
in flowing Ar, with the spectra collected every minute. Operando DRIFTS during activation was performed in the same apparatus, with the gas outlet connected to a mass spectrometer. The catalyst was reduced in 60%-H

In situ Raman spectra were collected with a Horiba LabRam-HR spectrometer equipped with a visible laser excitation at 514 nm generated by a He–Cd laser. The laser was focused on the sample with a confocal microscope equipped with a ×50 long working distance objective (Olympus BX-30-LWD). The scattered photons were directed and focused onto a single-stage monochromator measured with an ultraviolet-sensitive liquid-N

clusters (
x

) on the Cu(111) surface (details in Supplementary Data

). The bottom layer in the Cu(111) unit cell was fixed in the optimized bulk positions, while the others were allowed to relax. A 15 Å vacuum along the

. The projector augmented-wave method
60
with the generalized gradient approximation parameterized by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
61
exchange–correlation functional with the kinetic cut-off energy of 450 eV was used. The Brillouin zone was sampled using the gamma-centred Monkhorst–Pack

for total energy and residual forces, respectively. The transition state of a chemical reaction was located using the climbing image nudged elastic band method

implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package.
The Gibbs free energy for each state was calculated by
$$G\left( T \right) = E_{{{{\mathrm{DFT}}}}} + G_{{{{\mathrm{correct}}}}}\left( T \right) = E_{{{{\mathrm{DFT}}}}} + {{{\mathrm{ZPE}}}} - TS + {\Delta}U_{0 \to T}$$

. The energy barrier of a chemical reaction is defined as the free energy difference between the initial and transition states.
Catalytic activity evaluation
The MSR reaction measurements were conducted in a continuous plug flow fixed-bed reactor with a 4 mm inner diameter. Before the test, 100 mg of the catalyst with 60–80 mesh was activated in situ at 300 °C under different gas environments and then cooled to 225 °C in Ar (30 ml min
–1
). An aqueous methanol solution with a specific water/methanol ratio of 1.3 was injected into the heated chamber by a syringe pump (0.02 ml min
–1
, WHSV of MeOH = 6 h
–1
) to evaporate the liquid. The steam was then mixed with the desired amount of Ar (30 ml min
–1
) as the carrier gas and introduced into the catalyst bed for reaction. The reactor effluent was separated in a phase separator and analysed by online gas chromatography equipped with a methanizer and flame ionization detector and a thermal conductivity detector. Methanol conversion and the selectivity of products were calculated according to equations (

) and (
