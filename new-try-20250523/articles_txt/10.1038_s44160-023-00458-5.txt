Abstract
Low-selective CO
2
photoreduction systems are often overlooked in research, because the resulting mixed products are difficult to use in further reactions. In particular, the reutilization of gaseous hybrid products (such as CO and H
2
), which are often mixed with incompletely converted CO
2
, is difficult. Here we design and construct two highly active cluster-based catalysts,
Ni
5
W
10
and
Ni
6
W
10
, which can be utilized in an efficient triple tandem reaction composed of low-selective CO
2
photoreduction, alkyne semi-hydrogenation and carbonylation reactions. The triple tandem system can sequentially convert the H
2
and CO mixture into high-value olefins and carbonyls, with an atomic utilization efficiency of up to 94%. In situ one-pot coupling of low-selective CO
2
photoreduction with alkyne semi-hydrogenation promotes the overall photoconversion efficiency (up to 1,425.0 μmol g
−1
h
−1
), CO selectivity (from 50.8% to 80.0%) and alkyne-to-olefin transformation (conversion >86.0%, selectivity ~100.0%). Subsequently, the purified CO can be converted to different types of carbonylated product (CO conversion between 51% and 99%).

Main
The solar energy-driven carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO
2
RR), which directly converts CO
2
into useful chemicals, has emerged as a promising CO
2
recycling technology
1
,
2
,
3
. However, C
1
products (such as CO and HCOOH) are usually produced
4
,
5
,
6
, while higher value C
2
or C
2+
products are less common
7
,
8
. Additionally, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a common side reaction that further reduces the product selectivity of CO
2
photoreduction, therefore producing a mixture of hydrogen (H
2
) and carbon-based reduction products
9
,
10
. Gaseous products (such as unknown and variable mixtures of CO and H
2
), which are often mixed with unconverted CO
2
, must initially undergo complicated and expensive separation procedures before further utilization
11
,
12
,
13
. Therefore, the development of an upgrade utilization pathway for mixed products is an effective solution to rescue low-selective CO
2
photoreduction systems
14
.
The hybrid products of low-selective CO
2
photoreduction systems typically involve low-concentrated H
2
, CO and HCOOH (ref.
15
). In terms of separation and application, gas–liquid mixture products are easy to separate, but gaseous mixture products (for example, CO and H
2
) are more difficult due to higher energy consumption and cost
16
,
17
,
18
. Although certain specific ratios of CO and H
2
mixture can be treated as syngas for industrial conversion
19
,
20
,
21
,
22
, the uncertain mixing ratio of CO, H
2
and remaining unconverted CO
2
in a low-selective CO
2
photoreduction system is not suitable for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. Therefore, CO
2
photoreduction to syngas for conversion has been proposed as a conceptual work but not realized
23
. If a mild, efficient and highly atomic-economic tandem reaction is developed to reconvert CO and H
2
into high-value chemicals
24
,
25
and if the tandem reaction is unaffected by unreacted residual CO
2
, then low-selective CO
2
photoreduction could be a realistic utilization route. For instance, in such tandem reaction, H
2
by-products in low-selective CO
2
RR can be efficiently utilized by in situ cascades of specific organic reactions; then, the purified CO product
26
,
27
,
28
can be passed on to a second tandem reaction for further conversion (Fig.
1
). By this way, the mixed H
2
and CO are consecutively converted into high-value and easily separable fine chemicals through a multi-step tandem reaction, avoiding any waste of main products or by-products.

2
photoreduction, alkyne semi-hydrogenation and carbonylation reactions to sequentially synthesize and upgrade the H
2
and CO mixture
29
,
30
. The in situ tandem semi-hydrogenation reaction was used to integrate the side reaction HER in the CO
2
photoreduction process to achieve a high value conversion of the by-product H
2
and purification of CO. Then, CO was converted by a tandem carbonylation reaction. Moreover, in situ coupling of CO
2
photoreduction reaction with alkyne semi-hydrogenation largely promotes the overall photoconversion efficiency (up to 1,425.0 μmol g
−1
h
−1
), CO product selectivity (from 50.8% to 80.0%) and alkyne-to-olefin transformation (conversion >86.0%, selectivity ~100.0%).
The large number of protons originally used for HER was efficiently converted to high-value olefins in situ, thus enabling the application of H
2
isolated from gas mixtures (H
2
, CO and CO
2
residual). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with substrate expansion experiments revealed that compared with
Ni
5
W
10
(with traditionally independent active sites which experience the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism in the semi-hydrogenation reaction),
Ni
6
W
10
with synergistic active regions could greatly reduce the energy barrier of the hydrogenation process through the Volmer–Tafel mechanism, resulting in higher catalytic activity. After the one-pot coupling, the purified CO was continuously reconverted to high-value carbonyls by a ‘second tandem chamber’ of carbonylation reaction, and the maximum atomic utilization of products (H
2
+ CO) could be up to 94%. This work represents a solution to rescue the low-selective CO
2
photoreduction system and upcycle their hybrid products in a valuable and highly atomic-economic manner.

10
(Fig.

)
31
,
32
,
33
. In this catalyst structure, the classical Ni
5
cluster exposed four independent active Ni sites at the vertex of the tetrahedral configuration, which can be used for the adsorption and catalytic conversion of CO
2
and organic molecules. The W
10
cluster, also known as ‘electron sponge’, has excellent charge transfer capabilities and can enhance visible light absorption due to the flexible valence transition (W
VI
(colourless)/W
V
(blue))
34
,
35
, resulting in catalysts with improved electron transport performance and electron-hole separation effects (Supplementary Tables
1
and
2
). Therefore, the direct bonding of these two cluster monomers (
Ni
5
W
10
) is beneficial for possible photocatalytic tandem reactions. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) (Supplementary Notes
1
and
2
) analysis revealed that
Ni
5
W
10
assembly crystallizes in the triclinic space group
P
-1 (Supplementary Tables
3
and
4
) and consisted of complete Ni
5
and W
10
clusters arranged alternately. Each W
10
cluster linearly coordinates with two Ni atoms (Ni2 and Ni3) of two Ni
5
clusters through two O-bridging atoms (O1 and O43) to form a one-dimensional chain (Fig.
2b
and Supplementary Fig.
2
). All NO
3
−
ions in the original Ni
5
cluster are replaced by solvent molecules (H
2
O or DMF) to balance the negative charge of W
10
. Furthermore, these coordinated solvent molecules are easily removed to expose more active metal sites for achieving efficient catalytic performance. Additionally, considering that the cascaded alkyne semi-hydrogenation reaction may involve synergistic interaction of catalytic sites, we further synthesized another assembly catalyst
Ni
6
W
10
(Supplementary Note
3
). SCXRD results showed that
Ni
6
W
10
crystallizes in the triclinic space group
P
-1 (Supplementary Tables
5
and
6
) and exhibited a similar one-dimensional chain structure consisting of alternating linkages of Ni
6
and W
10
clusters (Fig.
2a,c
). In
Ni
6
W
10
, all six Ni atoms exhibit an octahedral coordination geometry and contain a readily dissociative solvent molecule (H
2
O). Thus, during the catalytic reaction, these exposed and adjacent Ni atoms (Ni1, Ni2 and Ni3) could form two apparently catalytically active regions (Fig.
2a
). These active regions could theoretically adsorb multiple substrates with specific sizes and configurations simultaneously to enable subsequent catalytic transformation. Notably,
Ni
5
W
10
/
Ni
6
W
10
catalysts were also easily reduced to heteropoly blue (reduced polyoxometalates) under illumination due to the characteristics of W
10
, thus changing the photoabsorption of the catalysts (Supplementary Fig.

). Meanwhile, the short O bridges between Ni

and

crystals in different colours and sizes were obtained by the solvothermal synthesis method (Supplementary Fig.
5
). In view of the difference in the crystal colour, ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was performed to determine their light absorption range and band structures. The ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared absorption spectra showed that both
Ni
5
W
10
and
Ni
6
W
10
have broad absorbance in the visible light region of 480–700 nm (Supplementary Fig.
6
). Meanwhile, the sharp transient photocurrent response (Supplementary Fig.
7
) also indicated that they have outstanding performance in photogenerated charge separation and transfer under visible light irradiation (Supplementary Note
4
). The band gaps of these two assemblies were estimated to be 2.73 eV and 2.89 eV, respectively, through Tauc plots (Supplementary Figs.
8
and
9
). Moreover, the highest occupied molecular orbital levels of
Ni
5
W
10
and
Ni
6
W
10
were calculated as −6.51 and −6.84 eV (versus vacuum level) (Supplementary Figs.
10
and
11
) by ultraviolet electron spectroscopy measurements. Then, the corresponding lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels of the two assemblies were calculated as −3.78 and −3.95 eV (ref.
36
). These values were verified to be in close agreement with the Mott–Schottky measurements (Supplementary Figs.
12
and
13
, and Supplementary Note
4
). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels of these two cluster-based assemblies are more negative than the reduction potential of CO
2
-to-CO conversion (−4.34 eV versus vacuum level) (Supplementary Figs.
14
and
15
). Therefore, both
Ni
5
W
10
and
Ni
6
W
10
can be used as effective photocatalysts to realize CO
2
RR thermodynamically.

O, bpy = 2′,2-bipyridine) and sacrificial agent (TEOA, triethanolamine) (Supplementary Figs.

and Supplementary Note

). The experimental results showed that
Ni
5
W
10
and
Ni
6
W
10
could photoreduce CO
2
to different proportions of hybrid products (CO and H
2
), respectively. Among them, the CO

-to-CO conversion rate of
Ni
5
W
10
can reach up to 775.2 μmol g
−1
h
−1
(8 h) and effectively inhibit the generation of by-product H
2
(187.7 μmol g
−1
h
−1
)
37
, thereby exhibiting good CO selectivity (81.0%) (Supplementary Fig.
19
). By comparison,
Ni
6
W
10
showed a relatively low CO selectivity (50.8%) and production rate (474.1 μmol g
−1
h
−1
) under identical photocatalytic conditions (Supplementary Fig.
20
). Therefore, it exhibited a higher by-product H
2
generation rate (459.7 μmol g
−1
h
−1
). In this context, we have discussed the elementary steps of CO
2
RR for
Ni
5
W
10
and
Ni
6
W
10
by means of DFT calculations with the computational hydrogen electrode model, where HER was used as a side reaction (Supplementary Note
6
). The free energy diagram shows that the process of
*
CO
2
forming
*
COOH via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the potential determining step (PDS) for reducing CO
2
to CO, the corresponding H
+
binding electrons form
*
H as the PDS for HER. The PDS of CO
2
RR (Supplementary Fig.
21
) has a lower Gibbs free energy activation barrier (Δ
G
) compared with HER (Supplementary Fig.
22
), which is key for the photoreduction system with
Ni
5
W
10
(Δ
G
*COOH
= 0.15 < Δ
G
*H
= 0.26 eV) (Supplementary Fig.
23
) as catalyst exhibited high CO selectivity
38
. Similarly, the thermodynamically lower PDS of HER results in a low CO selectivity of
Ni
6
W
10
(Δ

= 0.59 > Δ

).
To explore the transfer path of photogenerated electrons in the catalytic process, the linear Stern–Volmer photoluminescence (PL) quenching plots (Supplementary Note
7
, and Supplementary Figs.
25
and
26
) and decay of PL lifetime (Supplementary Fig.

) of [Ru(bpy)

solution in the presence of
Ni

and

indicated that the photogenerated electrons were firstly transferred from the light-excited [Ru(bpy)

(PS
*
) to the catalysts to form PS
+
; then, the PS
+
was regenerated by the sacrificial agent TEOA (oxidative quenching mechanism)
39
,
40
. In addition, the heterogeneous catalyst
Ni
5
W
10
not only exhibits similar photocatalytic CO
2
RR performance compared with the homogeneous catalyst Ni
5
(Supplementary Figs.

and

30
). The above experiments also demonstrated that the introduction of W
10
improved the overall electron-transport performance of the catalyst, thus facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charges in the photoreduction system. Relevant comparative experiments (Supplementary Table
8
) and
13
C isotope trace experiments clearly verified that the two cluster-based assemblies are indeed active for CO
2
RR and the product CO came from CO
2
rather than the decomposition of other species (Supplementary Fig.
31
). In addition, the long-term catalytic stability tests showed that
Ni
5
W
10
and
Ni
6
W
10
could undergo at least three cycles (Supplementary Figs.
32
and
33
) and still maintained good catalytic performance. Importantly, the powder X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Figs.
34
and
35
), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Supplementary Figs.
36
and
37
) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra (Supplementary Fig.
38
) before and after the photocatalytic reaction were almost unchanged, which proved that these heterogeneous catalysts still maintain good stability.
One-pot tandem reaction
Although the reported photocatalytic CO
2
RR system had a high photocatalytic CO
2
-to-CO generation rate, H
2
generation also exhibited a high rate, especially for
Ni
6
W
10
. Therefore, the competitive HER not only reduced the selectivity of photoreduction products (CO), but also further increased the difficulty of subsequent reduction product (CO + H
2
) separation and utilization. In this case, we first coupled the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes with photocatalytic CO
2
RR via a one-pot method (chamber A). In chamber A, the H
+
or adsorbed H (
*
H) generated in the system could be efficiently converted in situ to high-value olefinic compounds through the tandem alkyne semi-hydrogenation reaction, resulting in the effective suppression of the formation of H
2
by-product and improving the selectivity of the photoreduction product CO. On this basis, the purified CO can be further converted to higher-value fine chemicals by another tandem organocatalytic reaction (chamber B), as shown in Fig.
1
(Supplementary Fig.
39
). Furthermore, the solar energy and the proton source (H
+
) in the reaction solution could provide the energy and hydrogen source for the semi-hydrogenation reaction, respectively, avoiding high energy expenditure and the explosion risk associated with directly utilizing large amounts of H
2
in conventional thermos-catalytic semi-hydrogenation reactions
41
,
42
.
In the one-pot method, an important prerequisite for the successful conduct of the tandem reaction in chamber A is good compatibility between the semi-hydrogenation reaction and the photocatalytic CO
2
RR (Supplementary Note
5
). According to the above experimental design, we first added 0.1 mmol (11 μl) phenylacetylene as substrate to the low-selective (50.3%) CO
2
photoreduction system (
Ni
6
W
10
) and for the same catalytic reaction time (8 h) (Fig.
3a
). Under visible-light irradiation and without Pd catalyst and additional H
2
gas as a hydrogen source,
Ni
6
W
10
could successfully achieve selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene with 81% conversion and olefin selectivity of up to 98% (Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Fig.
40
). The introduction of phenylacetylene notably reduced the production of H
2
in the tandem reaction system from original 459.7 μmol g
−1
h
−1
(Supplementary Fig.
20
) to 65.1 μmol g
−1
h
−1
, and successfully improved the CO selectivity from 50.1% to 77.4% (Fig.
3a
). At the same time, the rate of CO production was affected to some extent due to the presence of a higher concentration of phenylacetylene in the reaction system, which decreased from 474.1 μmol g
−1
h
−1
to 223.4 μmol g
−1
h
−1
(Fig.
3a
). For highly selective photocatalytic CO
2
RR (CO selectivity 80%) with
Ni
5
W
10
(Supplementary Fig.
19
), the generation rate of the main product CO was reduced from 775.2 μmol g
−1
h
−1
to 253.7 μmol g
−1
h
−1
and by-product H
2
also decreased from 187.7 μmol g
−1
h
−1
to 37.2 μmol g
−1
h
−1
(Fig.
3b
and Supplementary Fig.
41
). Despite an increased in CO selectivity, high concentrations of phenylacetylene prevent the effective utilization of H
+
in the CO
2
reduction pathway.

According to the above experimental results and a series of the proton-assisted multi-electron transfer process of CO
2
RR, both the photocatalytic reduction products (CO + H
2
) yield was decreased, which indicated that the hydrogen source for the semi-hydrogenation in the photocatalytic tandem system might originate from H
+
. To further establish this fact, the one-pot tandem reaction was carried out under identical photocatalytic reaction conditions without TEOA and H
2
O as proton sources, and hydrogenation of alkynes could not occur with direct injection of H
2
(Supplementary Table
9
). This demonstrated that alkyne semi-hydrogenation in the photocatalytic CO
2
RR system was a process of hydrogenation by diffusion of H
+
to the catalytically active site and then acquiring electrons for transferring to the alkyne substrate, rather than the process of generating H
2
and subsequent splitting into H
*
(excluding the Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism)
43
. More importantly, as a blank control, the selective hydrogenation reaction could not be conducted in the absence of catalysts (Supplementary Table
9
). Thus,
Ni
5
W
10
and
Ni
6
W
10
were used as multifunctional catalysts to drive the photocatalytic CO
2
RR and the semi-hydrogenation. Moreover, the decrease in the yield of CO and H
2
reduction products, as well as the same conversion efficiency of semi-hydrogenation under Ar conditions (HER only) (Supplementary Table
9
) indicated that the hydrogenation of alkynes as a competing reaction in this tandem catalytic system prioritized over HER and CO
2
RR. Therefore, the utilization of H
+
by the semi-hydrogenation reaction not only effectively reduced the production of H

O), leading to a decrease in CO reduction products.
To maintain the initial CO production rate, while improving CO selectivity, the concentration of phenylacetylene added to the tandem reaction was systematically regulated.
Ni
6
W
10
was initially examined, and it was found that when only 1 μl (≈9 μmol) of phenylacetylene was included in the reaction (100% conversion) (Supplementary Fig.
40
), the H
2
yield of photocatalytic CO
2
RR increased to 572.8 μmol g
−1
h
−1
(Fig.
3a
). However, the CO
2
reduction performance remained almost constant, causing a decrease in CO selectivity to 45% (Fig.
3a
). Likewise,
Ni
5
W
10
went through the same process noted above (1–3 μl, conversion >99%, alkene selectivity >77%) (Supplementary Fig.
41
), causing a decrease in selectivity from 81.0% to 64.2% (Fig.
3b
). On the above evidence, the addition of alkyne indeed accelerated the transfer of H
+
in solution and photogenerated electrons to catalytically active sites. Fortunately, the limited utilization of H
+
by low concentrations of phenylacetylene did not affect the process of binding protons in CO
2
RR, but the large amounts of H
+
accumulating near the catalytic site that was not involved in the hydrogenation reaction could be further coupled to generate H
2
, thus accelerating overall HER and leading to an increase in overall conversion efficiency (original 935.0 μmol
−1
g
−1
h
−1
increased to 1,267.5 μmol
−1
g
−1
h
−1
) (Supplementary Table
10
). Afterward, when phenylacetylene was increased to 2–5 μl (Fig.
3a
) (conversion >85%, alkene selectivity >99%) (Supplementary Fig.
40
), in particular for 5 μl (≈45.5 μmol), the H
2
production rate declined dramatically to 90.0 μmol g
−1
h
−1
(Fig.
3a
), while the CO production maintained a good rate at 358.0 μmol g
−1
h
−1
that increased the selectivity of CO to 80% (Fig.
3c
). Overall photocatalytic efficiency raised to 1,425.0 μmol g
−1
h
−1
. Compared with
Ni
6
W
10
,
Ni
5
W
10
itself had good CO selectivity and H
+
was used mainly in the CO
2
-to-CO conversion process. Therefore, the utilization of H
+
by the hydrogenation of
Ni
5
W
10
would severely hamper the highly selective photocatalytic CO
2
reduction process. That the yield of both the H
2
and CO decreased rapidly at the same time as the concentrations of phenylacetylene increased (5–11 μl, conversion >66%, alkene selectivity >92%) (Supplementary Fig.
41
) was also contrary to our tandem concept. Hence, this strategy of increasing the CO selectivity was more suitable for low-selective photocatalytic systems.
Meanwhile, the yield–time curves for CO and H
2
were also tested in the presence of 5 μl phenylacetylene and the CO selectivity was found to always remain at around 70% (
Ni
5
W
10
) (Supplementary Fig.
42
) and 80% (
Ni
6
W
10
) (Fig.
3c
) throughout the 8 h photocatalytic process. The experimental results demonstrated that the semi-hydrogenation reaction has a priority, when the CO
2
RR and semi-hydrogenation reactions were conducted simultaneously in a one-pot tandem system. Furthermore, the selectivity and yield of semi-hydrogenation remained constant over at least three cycles in long-term use and recyclability tests, illustrating the good sustainability of the tandem catalytic system (Fig.
3d
and Supplementary Fig.
43
). It can be seen that CO selectivity could be raised in
Ni
6
W
10
while maintaining a high CO
2
-to-CO photoreduction performance with the addition of 5 μl phenylacetylene, thus favouring the further application of CO
2
reduction products. The one-pot cascade reaction photoreduced CO
2
to CO, and the introduced alkyne semi-hydrogenation reaction could efficiently utilize H
+
(conversion >86%) in the solution to regulate and improve the CO selectivity by controlling H
2
yield. Moreover, to explore the main sources of protons in hydrogenation reactions, and based on the applications of deuterated compounds in medicinal chemistry
44
, we performed deuteration reactions in different deuterated solvents with easily isolated 4-bromophenylacetylene as a substrate for one-pot tandem reaction (Fig.
3e
and Supplementary Fig.
44
). The system contains a partial source of H
+
due to incomplete deuteration of the solvent, and deuterium (D) atoms have twice the mass number of H atoms, so H is much more reactive than D (ref.
45
) (Supplementary Fig.
45
). Consequently, the reaction produces a mixture of olefins with different degrees of deuteration (1D/2D/3D) in all-deuteration reaction solvent (Fig.
3e
). When only D
2
O or D
3
-TEOA was employed as the deuterated solvent (Supplementary Fig.
46
), the partially deuterated products could also be obtained. The deuterated experiment illustrated that H
+
derived from H
2
O and TEOA in solution during the reaction. This one-pot tandem strategy successfully converts the H
2
by-product into high-valued alkene while improving the overall efficiency of photocatalysis as well as turnover number (TON), TON based on photosensitizer and turnover frequency (Supplementary Table
10
), and can also a safe and convenient method to achieve the precise synthesis of high-value-added deuterated alkenes from D
2
O at room temperature instead of the expensive D
2
.
Exploration experiments of substrate scope
Before evaluating the broader applicability of this tandem reaction, we first investigated the interaction between catalyst, photosensitizer and alkyne to determine the catalytic activity centre, using phenylacetylene as the model substrate. In this work, the fluorescence intensity and PL lifetime of [Ru(bpy)
3
]Cl
2
could not be quenched with the addition of phenylacetylene (Supplementary Figs.
47
and
48
), suggesting that the photogenerated electrons excited by Ru[(bpy)
3
]Cl
2
could not be transferred to phenylacetylene and there was no notable interaction between them. However, the PL intensity decreased notably with the addition of phenylacetylene to either
Ni
5
W
10
or
Ni
6
W
10
(Supplementary Figs.
49
and
50
) indicating that the fluorescence emission of the catalysts was efficiently quenched. In combination with the XPS spectra, the positive shift in Ni
2p
binding energy (≈0.17 eV or 0.33 eV) (Supplementary Figs.
51
and
52
, and Supplementary Note
8
) indicated a decrease in the charge density of the Ni atom, probably due to partial charge transfer from the Ni site to absorbed phenylacetylene
46
. The above measurements confirmed strong electron interaction between the catalyst and the organic substrate. Furthermore, comparative experiments showed that the independent Ni
5
cluster was still active for ‘one-pot’ tandem reaction, but W
10
cluster as a catalyst was unable to perform the semi-hydrogenation reaction under the same photocatalytic conditions (Supplementary Table
9
). Additionally, the infrared spectra (Supplementary Fig.
53
) of the adsorption experiments combined with DFT theoretical calculations (Supplementary Figs.
54
and
55
) revealed the peaks associated with C≡C (2,111.0 cm
−1
) were red-shifted on both
Ni
5
W
10
(2,045.0 cm
−1
) and
Ni
6
W
10
(2,072.9 cm
−1
) when the phenylacetylene interacted with the nickel cluster. From this, we identified that the Ni clusters (Ni
5
or Ni
6
), which could form interactions with organic substrates, were the active centres of the semi-hydrogenation reactions.
Subsequently, we investigated the reaction substrate scope for alkynes under the tandem reaction conditions (Table
1
, Supplementary Table
11
, and Supplementary Notes
9
and
10
). Owing to the bare vertex of the tetrahedral configuration,
Ni
5
W
10
has little steric hindrance as the catalytic active site, which favours the direct adsorption and activation of C≡C. All substrates presented in Table
1
would be hydrogenated to the corresponding alkenes, and the hydrogenation turnover rates of partial alkynes (Table
1
, and entries 11, 14 and 15) could be as high as 85–99%. Unexpectedly, it can be seen that photocatalysis using
Ni
5
W
10
has a highly diastereoselective hydrogenation process, the hydrogenation products of all intramolecular alkynes were mainly
cis
-olefin compounds (
Z
:
E
= 75–99%)
42
,
47
. Under the same reaction conditions,
Ni
6
W
10
also provided alkenes with good diastereoselective (
Z
:
E
= 70–99%), but cannot catalyse all intramolecular alkynes. Due to the large hindrance effect at the active site of
Ni
6
W
10
, various organic compounds of different conformations could be selectively catalysed by different forces.
Table 1 Substrate scope of semi-hydrogenation reaction
Full size table
For
Ni
6
W
10
, it was found from the adsorption model that the organic molecules in a planar configuration (entries 1–4 in Table
1
and Supplementary Notes
11
–
14
) were adsorbed mainly by a strong π–π stacking interaction between the phenyl ring and the ligand (entries 1–4 in Supplementary Fig.
56
). The adsorption energies of entries 1–4 compounds on the catalysts were not obviously different
48
(Supplementary Fig.
57
). So, the different halogenated alkyne (F, Cl and Br) had little effect on the catalytic performance (conversion >80%, selectivity >98%). However, when the configuration of alkyne compounds (entries 5–9 in Supplementary Fig.
56
and Supplementary Notes
15
–
19
) was no longer planar or had a large spatial resistance (entries 10 and 11) (Supplementary Notes
20
and
21
), the π–π interactions disappeared and the binding of organic substrates to active sites was hindered (adsorption energy >−0.5 eV in Supplementary Fig.
57
), thus making it difficult for the hydrogenation reaction to proceed. The induction of electron-withdrawing groups enhanced the adsorption of organic substrates on the catalyst through coordination (entries 12, 13 and 15) or hydrogen bonding interactions (entry 14) (Supplementary Figs.
56
and
57
, and Supplementary Notes
22
–
25
), and facilitated the activation of the neighbouring alkyne group, leading to a 90% conversion to hydrogenation of some substrates. The above calculations and experimental results showed that
Ni
6
W
10
can selectively adsorb organic molecules by different forces and perform catalytic semi-hydrogenation reactions, and the catalytic efficiency also depends on the adsorption of alkynes and the position of C≡C. Overall, the photocatalytic tandem system could convert alkyne compounds to the corresponding olefins with very high selectivity (>90%) and very high stereoselectivity (
cis
-selectivity) for the conversion of intramolecular alkynes (Supplementary Table
11
).
DFT calculations of catalyst reaction mechanisms
Based on the experimental results and precise crystal structures, we inferred a possible mechanism for the visible-light-driven selective reduction of alkyne to an alkene by both thermodynamic and dynamic analysis (Supplementary Note
6
). With phenylacetylene as a model substrate, the traditional single-site catalytic pathway of
Ni
5
W
10
was first analysed. Although the exposed Ni active site can activate the substrate by adsorption of C≡C π-bonds to form an adsorbed state
*
PhC≡CH (
*
1) via an exothermic process, the semi-hydrogenation still needed to experience two transition states (TS1 and TS2) to obtain the final product, as shown in Fig.
4
. In the reaction solution, the alkyne adsorption sites tend towards saturation, while the formation of
*
PhCH=CH (
*
1-H) intermediates on them is thermodynamically more favourable than the formation of
*
H intermediates in HER. Consequently, the first hydrogenation step (TS1) can only form the semi-hydrogenated intermediate product
*
1-H using the Volmer mechanism of PCET (
*
PhC≡CH + H
+
+e
−
\(\to\)
*
PhCH=CH) to overcome 0.55 eV energy barrier
49
,
50
(Fig.
4a
). Catalysts with a single active site cannot synergistically perform hydrogenation. Despite this, the second step (TS2) can follow the Heyrovsky mechanism by coupling chemisorption of
*
1-H to another proton in solution (
*
PhCH=CH + H
+
+ e
−
\(\to\)
PhCH=CH
2
), with an energy barrier of 0.94 eV. In this tandem reaction process, the semi-hydrogenation reaction of
Ni
5
W
10
undergoes a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism (Fig.
4a
), which means that the hydrogenation is completed by two consecutive PCET steps after the activation of alkyne organics by
Ni
5
W
10
(Supplementary Fig.
58
).

Ni
6
W
10
can achieve synergistic catalysis through the active region formed by adjacent metal active sites (Ni1, Ni2 and Ni3) (Fig.
2c
), and thus the source pathway of the H atom in the hydrogenation reaction is more abundant. DFT theoretical calculations indicate that the TS1 of
Ni
6
W
10
is similar to
Ni
5
W
10
(Fig.
4
). Furthermore, with the presence of the active region, a semi-hydrogenated intermediate can not only be carried out by the Heyrovsky mechanism, but also bind to
*
H on the neighbour site by the Tafel mechanism. However, the Heyrovsky pathway (0.73 eV) has a higher hydrogenation barrier than the Tafel pathway (0.45 eV) (Fig.
4b
). The synergistically active region in
Ni
6
W
10
makes the hydrogenation reaction proceed easier through Tafel mechanism, which can greatly reduce the kinetic barriers of TS2 (ref.
51
). Therefore,
Ni
6
W
10
is more suitable for the Volmer–Tafel mechanism, meaning that
*
1-H combines
*
H at adjacent active sites in a synergistic manner to obtain the olefin product. Similarly, the lower energy barrier makes the catalytic performance of phenylacetylene hydrogenation with
Ni
6
W
10
(Δ
G
= 0.45 eV) (Fig.
4b
) superior to
Ni
5
W
10
(Δ
G
= 0.94 eV), in agreement with the experimental results. We observed that in the tandem reaction, either
Ni
5
W
10
or
Ni
6
W
10
as catalyst, the longer bond length distance (>4.70 Å) between the Ni active site and the C=C of alkene products does not allow chemisorption. Hence, these adsorption models indicate that the final formation of olefins is easily desorbed from our catalyst. The further hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes is thermodynamically unfavourable, leading to a catalyst exhibiting high selectivity in the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes (Supplementary Figs.
59
and
60
). Notably, the thermodynamic process of hydrogenation reaction of both is more advantageous relative to HER, which is the reason why the addition of phenylacetylene in the tandem reaction can effectively inhibit the H
2
generation and improve CO selectivity. In particular, the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism is two consecutive PCET steps, resulting in further competition with the PCET process of CO
2
RR, so that the H
2
and CO yields of
Ni
5
W
10
simultaneously decline substantially during regulating selectivity in the tandem reaction. But the lower potential barrier Tafel mechanism is more likely to utilize
*
H in the active region, so the reduction of H
2
in the tandem reaction of
Ni
6
W
10
is much greater than CO, making it easier to improve the selectivity of the reduced product CO. In conclusion, catalysts experiencing the Volmer–Tafel mechanism are more suitable for regulating CO
2
RR selectivity through employing semi-hydrogenation reactions in one-pot tandem reactions (Fig.
5
).

10
, HER and semi-hydrogenation all experienced the Volmer–Tafel mechanism.

Application of triple tandem reaction
After completing the one-pot (chamber A) tandem catalysis process, the low-selectivity photocatalytic CO
2
RR successfully achieved re-upgrade of the use value of by-product H
2
, while improving the CO selectivity (or purification). Inspired by the previous work in the field
52
,
53
, we could utilize a two-chamber tandem reactor to reconvert the remaining low-value reduction product CO into a more valuable and easily separable fine chemical by carbonylation reaction. Through the above strategy, the photocatalytic CO
2
RR, the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes and the palladium-catalysed carbonylation reaction could be combined in series by the two-chamber (A–B) method. Through the triple tandem system, the low-selective CO
2
reduction system could simultaneously convert the low-value and difficult-to-isolate reduction products H
2
and CO into high-value alkenes (chamber A) and carbonyl (chamber B) compounds, respectively (Fig.
5
). This strategy effectively prevents the waste of by-products in the CO
2
RR, improves the atomic economy and provides a feasible pathway for future applications of low-selectivity photocatalytic CO
2
RR (Supplementary Note
5
).
To evaluate the effectiveness of the triple tandem, we tried to cascade the reaction of chamber A with different carbonylation reactions to achieve CO reconversion (Fig.
6
and Supplementary Table
12
). The incompletely reacted terminal alkynes in the hydrogenation reaction could be separated and recycled; therefore, the Sonogashira reaction using terminal alkynes as raw material was first applied to this triple tandem reaction (Fig.
6a
). Under the reaction conditions of chamber B, phenylacetylene and aryl iodides could react with nearly 99% CO from chamber A to form corresponding carbonyl compounds involving the formation of C–C bonds
54
(Supplementary Note
26
). Thus, the triple tandem system successfully converted both reduction products CO and H
2
into valuable fine chemicals, achieving sequential separation of the gas phase products and an atomic utilization (Supplementary Note
9
) of 94% for the overall photocatalytic reduction product (Fig.
6g
). Classical carbonylative Suzuki coupling (Fig.
6b,c
and Supplementary Notes
27
and
28
) for the formation of C–C bonds was also investigated in the triple tandem system. Compared with the Sonogashira reaction, only about 52% of CO was converted indicating that the reaction was more sensitive to the CO concentration and the reaction activity decreases at relatively low CO concentrations, meaning the overall atomic efficiency of the triple tandem was only 81% (Fig.
6g
).

In view of the important applications of amide compounds in drug synthesis and industrial production
55
, the successful implementation of the amino-carbonylation reaction has greatly expanded the application prospects of the triple tandem system. A conversion of 71% on the basis of CO-to-d was detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) when
n
-butylamine (Fig.
6d
and Supplementary Note
29
) was employed as the amino source, and the overall reduction product had an atom utilization of 87% (Fig.
6g
). Importantly, the triple tandem strategy was used to synthesize commercially amide compounds such as the insecticide DEET (Fig.
6e
and Supplementary Note
30
) and the antidepressant drug molecule moclobemide (Fig.
6f
and Supplementary Note
31
) with high CO conversions of 87% and 81%, respectively, resulting in an atomic efficiency of nearly 90% for the entire triple tandem system (Fig.
6g
). At the same time, we also performed an isotopic tracing experiment (
13
CO
2
) of photocatalytic CO
2
RR in chamber A, and the reduction product
13
CO as reactant underwent a tandem amino-carbonylation reaction to successfully obtain the corresponding
13
C isotope-labelled moclobemide (Fig.
6h
and Supplementary Fig.
61
). The successful
13
C labelling of bioactive drug-like small molecules through a green and economical approach has shown potential for the application of tandem reactions in the field of metabolism. A techno-economic analysis shows that the triple tandem system offers cost savings and higher profitability compared with conventional separation strategies (Supplementary Note
10
). The triple tandem system successfully separated a mixture of low-concentration and difficult-to-separate photocatalytic CO
2
reduction products (CO + H
2
) in sequence (Supplementary Tables
11
and
12
), and converted them into high-value and easily separable fine chemicals (alkenes and carbonyl compounds).
Conclusions
Based on the design and synthesis of two distinct cluster-based assembly catalysts, we developed a mild and low-cost triple tandem system, which can achieve efficient separation of the mixed reduction products (H
2
+ CO) of low-selective CO
2
photoreduction system and convert them into value-added olefin and carbonyl products, respectively. Among them, in a one-pot tandem reaction, the coupled semi-hydrogenation not only suppressed the generation of H
2
by-product and successfully improved the CO selectivity (from 50% to 80%), but also efficiently converted alkynes to olefin compounds by using H
+
(conversion 86%, alkene selectivity >99%). Meanwhile, the purified CO was transformed to carbonyl fine chemicals through further cascade carbonylation reactions in the triple tandem process. Eventually, the utilization of the reduction products could be brought to a maximum of 94% atomic efficiency. We have also achieved the synthesis of deuterated olefins with a high deuterium incorporation rate and
13
C isotopically labelled bioactive molecules in a green and economical way. The tandem system with high atomic utilization offers great prospects for future practical applications of photocatalytic CO
2
RR with low product selectivity.

General procedure for triple tandem reaction experiments
These experiments were performed in two-chamber system. Chamber A (25 ml, Schlenk tube) was used for tandem selective hydrogenation reaction according to the protocol above (substrate: 5 μl phenylacetylene).

N (139.0 μl, 1.0 mmol), and the corresponding terminal alkyne or amine or aryl boronic acid (0.2 mmol). Subsequently, anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (3 ml) was added to the reactor. The two chambers were chained together by a short linker, all joints were in a closed state. Subsequently, only the joint of B was opened, and the B chamber was then flash frozen at 77 K (liquid N
2
bath) and degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles, and evacuated to an internal pressure of ~100 mTorr. Then, it was warmed to room temperature, and chamber A was placed under photocatalytic conditions and chamber B in an oil bath. After 8 h photocatalytic reaction, injection of 5.2 ml MeCN was performed in chamber A to increase the density of the gas in the container. Subsequently, chamber A’s joint was slowly opened and chamber B was stirred at 65 °C for 16 h in the oil bath. More details can be seen in Supplementary Note
