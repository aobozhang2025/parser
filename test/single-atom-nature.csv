Here, we report that N2 could be used to reduce the activation energy for catalytic hydrodeoxygenation over ruthenium-based catalysts. Specifically, we report a 4.3-fold activity increase in the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of p-cresol to toluene over a titanium oxide supported ruthenium catalyst (Ru/TiO2) by simply introducing 6 bar N2 under batch conditions at 160 °C and 1 bar hydrogen. Detailed investigations indicate that N2 can be adsorbed and activated on the metallic ruthenium surface to form hydrogenated nitrogen species, which offer protic hydrogen to lower the activation energy of direct carbonaromatic–oxygen bond scission and the hydrogenation of hydroxy groups. Thus, by employing different ruthenium catalysts, including Ru/TiO2, Ru/Al2O3, Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/C, we demonstrate that N2 promotion of hydrodeoxygenation can be regarded as a general strategy.","2019-12","2025-05-10 17:10:30","2025-05-10 17:10:30","2025-05-10 17:10:30","1078-1087","","12","2","","Nat Catal","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","D:\Zotero-data\storage\HFKZLDSX\Duan et al. - 2019 - Molecular nitrogen promotes catalytic hydrodeoxygenation.pdf","","","Catalytic mechanisms; Heterogeneous catalysis; Porous materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Highly porous carbonaceous geosupercapacitors were developed by pyrolysing cattle bones consisting of macromolecules interlinked with abundant minerals, followed by acid etching. Porous geosupercapacitors exhibit high capacitances and excellent electron-transfer efficiencies for O2 activation as a result of their abundant carbon defects and redox-active quinone moieties, thereby effectively transferring electrons to O2 to form O2•− radicals. Electrochemical analysis shows that the electron-transfer rate of the carbonaceous geosupercapacitor is orders of magnitude higher than that of traditional biochar, notably promoting electron transfer and O2 activation. This geosupercapacitor possesses excellent electron rechargeability and a stable capacitance, enabling sustainable O2•− production off-line. The utility of this green O2•− producing system is confirmed in different scenarios, such as stable performance in complex matrices, treating diverse redox-active pollutants and development of a portable chargeable device.","2024-05","2025-05-10 12:40:30","2025-05-10 12:40:30","2025-05-10 12:40:30","485-495","","5","2","","Nat Water","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","D:\Zotero-data\storage\ARRVI3CX\Fang et al. - 2024 - Rechargeable carbonaceous geosupercapacitor for sustainable superoxide generation and pollutant abat.pdf","","","Pollution remediation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, broadly applicable thermometry methods to selectively probe the temperature of the catalytically active phase—where reactions take place—are generally lacking. Here we explore extended X-ray absorption fine-structure thermometry to monitor the operando temperature of active Ni nanoparticles, fully deconvoluted from their metal-oxide support. During dry reforming of methane, the reaction’s endothermicity causes Ni nanoparticles to become local heat sinks with their temperature deviating 90 °C from the reactor temperature. By thermometry at the single nanoparticle level, we chart the energy balance of nanoparticles and relate their temperature to reaction kinetics. Covering the full temperature range relevant to catalysis, this broadly applicable method enables temperature monitoring of individual catalyst components separately. Applying extended X-ray absorption fine-structure thermometry to existing datasets worldwide can generate enhanced understanding on reaction-induced temperature phenomena in heterogeneous catalysis.","2025-02","2025-05-10 09:48:57","2025-05-10 09:48:57","2025-05-10 09:48:57","187-195","","2","8","","Nat Catal","","","","","","","","en","2025 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","D:\Zotero-data\storage\WG5D8E4T\Filez et al. - 2025 - Selectively monitoring the operando temperature of active metal nanoparticles during catalytic react.pdf","","","Heterogeneous catalysis; Characterization and analytical techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While well documented, H spillover is poorly understood and largely unquantified. Here we measure weak, reversible H2 adsorption on Au/TiO2 catalysts, and extract the surface concentration of spilled-over hydrogen. The spillover species (H*) is best described as a loosely coupled proton/electron pair distributed across the titania surface hydroxyls. In stark contrast to traditional gas adsorption systems, H* adsorption increases with temperature. This unexpected adsorption behaviour has two origins. First, entropically favourable adsorption results from high proton mobility and configurational surface entropy. Second, the number of spillover sites increases with temperature, due to increasing hydroxyl acid–base equilibrium constants. Increased H* adsorption correlates with the associated changes in titania surface zwitterion concentration. This study provides a quantitative assessment of how hydroxyl surface chemistry impacts spillover thermodynamics, and contributes to the general understanding of spillover phenomena.","2023-08","2025-05-09 08:17:16","2025-05-09 08:17:16","2025-05-09 08:17:16","710-719","","8","6","","Nat Catal","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","D:\Zotero-data\storage\3P6NKREH\Mahdavi-Shakib et al. - 2023 - The role of surface hydroxyls in the entropy-driven adsorption and spillover of H2 on AuTiO2 cataly.pdf","","","Catalytic mechanisms; Heterogeneous catalysis; Porous materials; Chemical engineering; Hydrogen fuel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A methodology is introduced to quantify various types of sites, revealing that the cationic redox Pt on the TiO2 surface is more active than metallic sites for C–O bond activation.","2020-05","2025-05-09 07:47:30","2025-05-09 07:47:30","2025-05-09 07:47:30","446-453","","5","3","","Nat Catal","","","","","","","","en","2020 This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","D:\Zotero-data\storage\ANRTDJAI\Fu et al. - 2020 - C–O bond activation using ultralow loading of noble metal catalysts on moderately reducible oxides.pdf","","","Heterogeneous catalysis; Density functional theory; Surface spectroscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these reactive supports are prone to deterioration during catalysis, limiting the lifespan of the catalyst and their potential practical applications4. New strategies are needed to simultaneously protect reactive supports and surface metal species without compromising the inherent catalytic performance. Here we report a new strategy to augment the structural stability of highly active interfacial catalysts by using inert nano-overlays to partially shield and partition the surface of the reactive support. Specifically, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/γ-Mo2N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of γ-Mo2N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation. This strategy yields an efficient and highly durable catalyst for hydrogen production by methanol-reforming reaction with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading, exhibiting a record-high turnover number, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 and a notable apparent turnover frequency of $$\mathrm{24,500}\,{\text{mol}}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\,{\text{mol}}_{{\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\,{\text{h}}^{-1}$$.

Instead, we identify several well-defined charge states that are dynamically interconnected and thus coexist. The origin of this new class of strong metal–support interactions is the relative position of the Ce(4f) levels with respect to those of the noble metal, allowing electron injection to (or recovery from) the support. This process is phonon-assisted, as the Ce(4f) levels adjust by surface atom displacement, and appears for other metals (Ni) and supports (TiO2).

We show that tuning of the Ir–O hybridization by controlling the Ir speciation can alter the catalyst surface chemical environment, enabling the stabilization of specific transition states for the production of either CO or CH4 during electrocatalysis. By achieving CO2 electrohydrogenation in tandem with light-alkane electrodehydrogenation, we further demonstrate that such an advanced electrolyser could be extended to the upgrade of different carbon resources in one-step, significantly enhancing the techno-economic feasibilty of the process.","2021-04","2025-05-09 07:26:18","2025-05-09 07:26:18","2025-05-09 07:26:18","274-283","","4","4","","Nat Catal","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","D:\Zotero-data\storage\M6Z66YXT\Li et al. - 2021 - Switching of metal–oxygen hybridization for selective CO2 electrohydrogenation under mild temperatur.pdf","","","Heterogeneous catalysis; Energy; Electrocatalysis; Chemical engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, designing these catalysts remains challenging due to the need for a high density of atomically dispersed active sites with a short-range quantum spin exchange interaction and long-range ferromagnetic ordering. Here, we devised a scalable hydrothermal approach involving an operando acidic environment for synthesizing various single-atom spin catalysts with widely tunable substitutional magnetic atoms (M1) in a MoS2 host. Among all the M1/MoS2 species, Ni1/MoS2 adopts a distorted tetragonal structure that prompts both ferromagnetic coupling to nearby S atoms as well as adjacent Ni1 sites, resulting in global room-temperature ferromagnetism. Such coupling benefits spin-selective charge transfer in oxygen evolution reactions to produce triplet O2. Furthermore, a mild magnetic field of ~0.5 T enhances the oxygen evolution reaction magnetocurrent by ~2,880% over Ni1/MoS2, leading to excellent activity and stability in both seawater and pure water splitting cells. As supported by operando characterizations and theoretical calculations, a great magnetic-field-enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance over Ni1/MoS2 is attributed to a field-induced spin alignment and spin density optimization over S active sites arising from field-regulated S(p)–Ni(d) hybridization, which in turn optimizes the adsorption energies for radical intermediates to reduce overall reaction barriers.","2023-07","2025-05-09 06:13:07","2025-05-09 06:13:07","2025-05-09 06:13:07","763-771","","7","18","","Nat.

However, applications are usually compromised by limited catalyst stability, which is due to sintering3,4. Although sintering can be suppressed by anchoring the metal atoms to oxide supports1,5,6, strong metal–oxygen interactions often leave too few metal sites available for reactant binding and catalysis6,7, and when exposed to reducing conditions at sufficiently high temperatures, even oxide-anchored single-atom catalysts eventually sinter4,8,9. Here we show that the beneficial effects of anchoring can be enhanced by confining the atomically dispersed metal atoms on oxide nanoclusters or ‘nanoglues’, which themselves are dispersed and immobilized on a robust, high-surface-area support. We demonstrate the strategy by grafting isolated and defective CeOx nanoglue islands onto high-surface-area SiO2; the nanoglue islands then each host on average one Pt atom. We find that the Pt atoms remain dispersed under both oxidizing and reducing environments at high temperatures, and that the activated catalyst exhibits markedly increased activity for CO oxidation. We attribute the improved stability under reducing conditions to the support structure and the much stronger affinity of Pt atoms for CeOx than for SiO2, which ensures the Pt atoms can move but remain confined to their respective nanoglue islands. The strategy of using functional nanoglues to confine atomically dispersed metals and simultaneously enhance their reactivity is general, and we anticipate that it will take single-atom catalysts a step closer to practical applications.","2022-11","2025-05-09 06:00:43","2025-05-09 06:00:43","2025-05-09 06:00:43","284-288","","7935","611","","","","","","","","","","en","2022 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","D:\Zotero-data\storage\96V5NDKI\Li et al. - 2022 - Functional CeOx nanoglues for robust atomically dispersed catalysts.pdf","","","Heterogeneous catalysis; Chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Applying the Newns–Andersen model, we find that on MNCs, like TMs, electron transfer to CO2 is facile.

We evaluate these computed mechanisms against pH-dependent experimental activity measurements on the CO2R to CO activity.

The in-depth study of OCTP has to some extent revealed the main reasons for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts during the reaction process and provided new research directions for the future study of heterogeneous catalytic systems.","2025-03","2025-05-09 04:39:58","2025-05-09 04:39:58","2025-05-09 04:39:58","334-344","","3","3","","Nat Water","","","","","","","","en","2025 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","D:\Zotero-data\storage\LNQ2YLGP\Chen et al. - 2025 - Organic carbon transfer process in advanced oxidation systems for water clean-up.pdf","","","Pollution remediation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Translation to a standardized, automated protocol demonstrates the robustness of our method and provides a path to explore virtually unlimited libraries of mono- or multimetallic catalysts. At the molecular level, characterization of the synthesis mechanism through experiments and simulations shows that controlling the bonding of metal precursors with the carrier via stepwise ligand removal prevents their thermally induced aggregation into nanoparticles. The drastically enhanced reactivity with increasing metal content exemplifies the need to optimize the surface metal density for a given application. Moreover, the loading-dependent site-specific activity observed in three distinct catalytic systems reflects the well-known complexity in heterogeneous catalyst design, which now can be tackled with a library of single-atom catalysts with widely tunable metal loadings.","2022-02","2025-05-09 04:21:47","2025-05-09 04:21:47","2025-05-09 04:21:47","174-181","","2","17","","Nat.

Pyrolytic strategies commonly used for synthesizing SACs generally suffer from aggregation at high metal loadings. Here we report a universal synthesis approach for ultrahigh-density metal–nitrogen–carbon (UHDM–N–C) SACs via a metal-sulfide-mediated atomization process. We show that our approach is general for transition, rare-earth and noble metals, achieving 17 SACs with metal loadings >20 wt% (including a loading of 26.9 wt% for Cu, 31.2 wt% for Dy and 33.4 wt% for Pt) at 800 °C, as well as high-entropy quinary and vicenary SACs with ultrahigh metal contents. In situ X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy alongside molecular simulations reveals a dynamic nanoparticle-to-single atom transformation process, including thermally driven decomposition of the metal sulfide and the trapping of liberated metal atoms to form thermodynamically stable M–N–C moieties. Our studies indicate that a high N-doping is crucial for achieving ultrahigh-loading metal atoms and a metal-sulfide-mediated process is essential for avoiding metal aggregation at high loadings. As a demonstration, the metal-loading-dependent activity in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction is demonstrated on SACs with increasing Ni content.","2024-11","2025-05-09 04:15:09","2025-05-09 04:15:09","2025-05-09 04:15:09","1427-1438","","11","3","","Nat.
