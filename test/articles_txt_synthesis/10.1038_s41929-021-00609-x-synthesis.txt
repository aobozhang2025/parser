O and 3.080 g of 2-methylimidazole were each dissolved in 75 ml methanol. Subsequently, the two solutions were mixed with vigorous stirring for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the as-obtained mixed solution was transferred to a sealed container and placed into a constant-temperature oven at 35 °C for 2 h. Finally, the as-obtained ZIF-8 was centrifuged, washed with methanol and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. For the synthesis of Fe/ZIF-8@PZM, 160 mg of bis(4-aminophenyl) ether and 80 mg of phosphonitrilic chloride trimer were dissolved in 50 ml methanol. Then, 200 mg of the as-obtained ZIF-8 was dispersed in 10 ml of methanol, followed by mixing homogeneously with 1 ml of 10 mg ml

Subsequently, a mixture of 4 ml triethylamine and 25 ml methanol was slowly added into the above suspension, followed by stirring at 40 °C for 4 h. Finally, the as-obtained Fe/ZIF-8@PZM was collected, washed and dried. ZIF-8@PZM was prepared with the same synthesis procedure as for Fe/ZIF-8@PZM except that Fe(NO

The as-obtained powder of Fe/ZIF-8@PZM was placed in a quartz boat and then kept at 950 °C for 3 h in a tube furnace with a heating rate of 5 °C min
