First, the CO

methanation activity of diluted Ni–ZrO
2
catalysts was systematically evaluated over a wide range of Ni loading (molar percentage) at 200 °C and a WHSV of 15,000 mL g
cat
−1
h
−1
(Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.
4
). With increasing molar percentage of Ni from 0 mol% to 100 mol%, a structural reversal of the metallic species (or oxides) from small nanoparticles to a continuous phase occurs (Supplementary Figs.
5
and
6
and Supplementary Table
2
). Interestingly, the space–time yield (STY) of CH
4
in the kinetic region for Ni–ZrO
2
samples at 200 °C shows a double volcano-shaped dependence on the molar ratio of oxide in the catalyst. The two local maxima appear at 13 mol% ZrO
2
/Ni (87 mol% Ni/ZrO
2
) and 30 mol% Ni/ZrO
2
, respectively. The CH

for the 30 mol% Ni/ZrO

conventional catalyst. Unlike in the widely reported conventional oxide-supported Ni catalysts (with a molar percentage of Ni ranging from approximately 10% to 40%), a second maximum is rarely observed; this is attributed to the formation of the inverse interfacial structure
29
,
30
.
The catalytic CO
2
methanation performance was compared further for a series of inverse catalysts and conventional Ni/oxide catalysts of the same compositions. The 13 mol% ZrO
2
/Ni inverse catalyst realized 88.2% CO
2
conversion with >99.9% methane selectivity at 240 °C (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
7a
). In contrast, the CO
2
conversion was only 19.8% for a conventional 30 mol% Ni/ZrO
2
catalyst. Apart from ZrO
2
/Ni catalysts, the advantages of inverse configuration were also observed for other reducible and nonreducible oxides constructed as inverse catalysts, such as CeO
2
/Ni, MgO/Ni and SiO
2
/Ni (Fig.
1c–e
, Supplementary Figs.
7b–d
and
8
and Supplementary Table
3
). The enhanced CO
2
adsorption capacities of these inverse catalysts compared with conventional catalysts is one possible reason for the observed performance improvements (Supplementary Fig.
9
).
As CeO
2
and ZrO
2
particles present relatively good CO
2
methanation activity, the mixed oxide strategy is used further to engineer the interfacial structure. CO
2
-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) studies revealed that the formation of mixed oxide on Ni support further enhanced the CO
2
activation capacity (Supplementary Fig.
9
). Compared with other state-of-the-art Ni-based CO
2
methanation catalysts
31
,
32

33
,
34
, the diluted 13 mol% CeZrO

methanation activity, which increased strongly at 160 °C and achieved ~40% CO
2
conversion and >99% CH

cat
−1
h
−1
at atmospheric pressure (Fig.
2a
and Supplementary Fig.
10a
); the CO
2
conversion was ~90% at 200 °C. In comparison, a widely recognized low-temperature CO
2
methanation catalyst, 10 mol% Ru/TiO
2
(refs.
31
,
32
,
33
,
34
), required temperatures of ~280 °C to obtain 44% CO
2
conversion under similar conditions. In addition, the 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO
x
catalyst was almost inactive below 240 °C, which further highlights the importance of the inverse configuration for low-temperature CO
2
methanation. As the metallic Ni NPs showed poor activity in the CO
2
hydrogenation reaction, it is clear that the combination of a continuous phase of metallic Ni, with dispersed nano-oxides, are a key factor that controls the activity of the inverse catalysts.

The reaction gas was further diluted to rule out local hot spots more thoroughly (<1 °C); performance evaluations demonstrated that the CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst started to show observable CH
4
formation at 160 °C, even in a dilute stream of 0.4% CO
2
(4 mbar), a typical atmospheric CO
2
concentration (Supplementary Fig.
10b
). In addition, the CO
2
conversion increased to 93% when the pressure was increased to 20 bar at 180 °C (Fig.
2b
). This finding is comparable with that of the RuO
2

, which was reported recently as the most competitive low temperature methanation catalyst at 180 °C (work at 20 bar, 110 mmol CH

under the same reaction conditions (Supplementary Fig.

CH4
profiles of literature-reported Ni- and Ru-based catalysts at 200 °C are summarized (Supplementary Table
4
); the mass specific activity of 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst is competitive. The intrinsic catalytic activities with inert dilution were also used to calculate the CH
4
-based apparent activation energy (
E
a-CH4
) (Fig.

and Supplementary Fig.

); that of 13 mol% CeZrO

/Ni is 66.5 kJ mol

, which is lower than that of 13 mol% ZrO
2
/Ni (74.4 kJ mol

) and much lower than that of conventional 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO
x
(96.2 kJ mol

) and 30 mol% Ni/ZrO
2
catalysts (94.4 kJ mol
−1
), indicating the promise of the Ni-supported nano-oxide inverse configuration for CO
2
methanation.
Usually, supported Ni catalysts are prone to deactivate under harsh reaction conditions such as overheating and start–stop cycles in CO
2
methanation owing to the strong tendency of sintering, leaching via Ni(CO)
4
and coke deposition
35
,
36
. The undiluted 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst was used to investigate stability in the intensely exothermic reaction. The 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst exhibited high CO
2
hydrogenation stability in a long-term stability test, including 350 h of temperature cycling and start–stop cycling tests (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Table
5
) and 400 h of uninterrupted testing (Supplementary Fig.
12a
), which offers a potential solution for coupling in unsteady renewable hydrogen systems. Even if the catalyst experienced a 450 °C thermal shock, the initial activity can be restored when the operating temperature drops back to 180 °C. It is worth noting that the heat released by methanation reaction promotes the reaction, and in the long-term stability test at 180 °C, the bed temperature remained stable at 199.3 °C (Supplementary Fig.
12b
). Moreover, when introducing additional 40–50 vol% steam in the gas feed at varied temperatures (180–450 °C), the activity and selectivity recovered after removing the steam (Supplementary Fig.
13
). Typically, 5–10 vol% water is introduced to test water resistance of catalysts
37
,
38
; the test result under 40–50 vol% water demonstrated that the 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst also realized high water resistance. In summary, the MO
x
/Ni inverse configuration was demonstrated to be a highly active and selective interfacial structure for the low-temperature CO
2
methanation reaction. CeZrO
x
/Ni is the most active combination among the studied inverse catalysts. Its high activity, long-term stability and high tolerance to unsteady operation and other harsh conditions showcase its potential for further applications.
