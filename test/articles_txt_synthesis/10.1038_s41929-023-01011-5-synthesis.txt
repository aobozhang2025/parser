synthesis of methanol from methane using O
2
as the oxidant and H
2
as the activating agent at ambient temperature, without the use of an external energy source (for example, light or electricity). From a mechanistic perspective, the Mo centre in its partially reduced state is found to be critical for an oxidation reaction to generate active oxygen species from O
2
, which extends our understanding of typical catalytic oxidation processes.

Taking Pd/CsPMA as an example, PMA hydrate (1.5 g) was dissolved in ultrapure water (30 ml) acidified with two drops of concentrated HNO

Stirring of the mixed suspension was continued for another 5 h at 0 °C, followed by centrifugation to separate the solid. The solid was washed further with ultrapure water three times, dried using a freeze-dryer, and carefully ground for use. To obtain the POM without Pd, the cation solution contained only Cs
