Then the temperature was raised to 85 °C. KOH (10 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water to form a precipitating agent, which was slowly dropped into the prepared precipitating solution, and stirred for 2 h. The mixture was evaporated using a rotary evaporator and the solid was dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. After grinding the solid in an agate mortar, the powder was calcined under air at 500 °C for 3 h (heating rate, 10 °C min

). After rinsing with deionized water and ethanol three times, the powder was dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and then calcined in argon at 600 °C for 2 h (heating rate, 2 °C min

Then the temperature was raised to 85 °C stirring continued for 2 h. The mixture was evaporated using a rotary evaporator and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h.
