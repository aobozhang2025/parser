Synthesis of CAZ-1
CAZ-1 was synthesized by a co-precipitation method using Na

O (Macklin, AR) precursors were weighed according to the metal loading and dissolved together into 100 ml deionized water to make a 0.03 M solution (solution A). An appropriate amount of Na

was weighed and dissolved in 100 ml deionized water to make a 0.06 M solution (solution B). After dissolution was complete, a peristaltic pump was used to slowly drip the two solutions A and B into another beaker containing 100 ml of deionized water at a rate of 0.3 ml min

. Throughout the dropping process, the mixture was stirred at 350 rpm while heating at 80 °C. Once the dropping was complete, stirring was stopped and the flocculent precipitate that had formed was aged at 80 °C for 2 h. After ageing, it was cooled to room temperature and washed with deionized water to pH 7, followed by drying in an oven at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the blue solid sample was ground into powder and calcined in a muffle furnace by heating at 2 °C min

to 350 °C over 5 h.
