catalyst preparation or (4) the stabilization of the Au in high oxidation states in the absence of water. Therefore we next investigated the use of low-polarity solvents with high boiling points such as
N
,
N
-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and cyclohexanone. The polarities, boiling points and drying temperatures along with the acetylene conversion values are reported in Table
1
. Although all the catalysts prepared with high-boiling-point (>120 °C) solvents performed better than the catalyst prepared in aqueous solution, they were not as active as the samples prepared with low-boiling-point solvents (<120 °C), suggesting that the drying temperature is also a parameter affecting the performance of the catalysts as well as the reducibility of the solvent at that specific drying temperature. PXRD analysis (Supplementary Fig.
8
) showed that the catalysts prepared at high drying temperatures contained Au nanoparticles, which is consistent with their lower activity. To probe whether the drying temperature was the only variable determining the high activity and dispersion, catalyst samples prepared with acetone were dried at 45, 65 and 140 °C for 16 h. As reported in Table
1
, the catalysts dried at 65 and 140 °C showed comparable activity to the sample dried at 45 °C, which demonstrates that effective catalysts can be prepared with low-polarity solvents and low drying temperatures. This suggests that it is the increased wettability of the impregnation solution on the carbon support coupled with mild drying conditions that leads to effective anchoring of single highly dispersed Au species, rather than the speciation being solely dictated by the drying temperature. Adding increasing amounts of water (5–50 vol.%) to the extra dry acetone decreased the activity of the as-prepared catalyst, as shown in Fig.
2c
, until at 50 vol.% the activity resembled that of samples prepared in aqueous solution. This reduction in activity correlates well with the development of reflections from metallic Au in the recorded PXRD patterns (Fig.
2d
). This confirms the negative impact of the presence of water on the preparation of highly dispersed Au catalysts in the absence of strong oxidizing/acidic agents or strongly coordinating ligands.

O catalysts (Supplementary Fig.
9
) showed the high stability of the Au/C-acetone catalyst under the reaction conditions. There was a small (3%) increase in conversion in the first 100 min, indicating a possible minor change in the Au oxidation state and a minimal induction period, followed by a further 140 min of steady conversion. The Au/C-aqua regia catalyst displayed a pronounced induction period due to changes in the Au oxidation state, which have been previously studied by in situ XAS, resulting in a 15% difference in conversion over the same time. The oxidizing aqua regia solvent, which has been used historically, resulted in a catalyst with a lower final conversion than that of the more benign catalyst prepared with acetone. This strongly suggests that the likely different functionality of the carbon supports can play a key role in determining the induction periods of these catalysts, through either stronger Au anchoring or facilitating changes in the oxidation state. As noted in previous work
12
, the Au present on Au/C-H

O is largely unreactive, being predominantly Au(0), hence this catalyst maintained a low (2%) conversion throughout the test.

] in acetone gave similar activities (27% conversion at 130 °C and 52% conversion at 180 °C) after 24 h of reaction. This is consistent with both materials containing highly dispersed gold cations. At 1 wt.% loading, the Au/C catalyst prepared from Au(

) thiosulfate also gave a comparable performance in acetylene hydrochlorination to the material prepared from H[AuCl
4
] in acetone.
XAS spectra at the Au L

-edge of the Au/C-acetone catalyst before and after reaction for 4 h were recorded, analysed and compared with those of the Au/C-aqua regia catalyst and Au foil. The three Au/C catalysts reveal significantly different post-edge features in comparison with metallic Au foil (Fig.
3a
). This supports the findings of PXRD and STEM analyses that no extended metallic Au structures are present in the fresh catalysts prepared with acetone or aqua regia. In particular, the normalized white line heights of the fresh samples prepared with acetone and aqua regia suggest that both catalysts contain a mixture of Au(
i
) and Au(
iii
) species, with the acetone catalyst being slightly more rich in Au(
i
) than the comparable sample prepared using aqua regia, based on a lower normalized white line height intensity (~0.66 for Au/C-acetone and ~0.78 for Au/C-aqua regia, Fig.
3a
). Three different Au standards were used to perform a LCF analysis of the Au L

), Au(

) and a Au foil standard spectra (Fig.
3b
). The LCF confirmed the cationic nature of the Au in the acetone-derived catalyst, with the Au predominantly existing in the Au(
i
) oxidation state (77%). This is similar in nature to the catalyst prepared using aqua regia, albeit with a different distribution of Au(
i
) and Au(
iii
) (57 and 43%, respectively). After 5 h of use, a small contribution from Au(0) could be detected in the Au/C-acetone catalyst, indicating a minor instability of the cationic Au species. It has been postulated that the reduction of Au species is responsible for catalyst deactivation; the stability observed in the acetylene hydrochlorination tests suggests that this agglomeration takes place during the heating ramp to the reaction temperatures and not during the reaction itself
26
. The EXAFS data for the fresh Au/C-acetone and Au/C-aqua regia catalysts (Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Table
3
) show Au–Cl distances and coordination numbers of 2.31(8) Å and 2.58(8), respectively, consistent with the mixed Au(
iii
)/Au(
i
) speciation determined by XANES. No long-range order or characteristic Au–Au distances were observed in the EXAFS spectra of either catalyst, when compared with the Au foil standard, again in agreement with the PXRD and HAADF-STEM analyses. An increase in the intensity of the Fourier transform at distances corresponding to those of the Au foil was observed in the used catalyst, in conjunction with a decrease in the Au–Cl bond length to 2.0(1) Å and the appearance of a Au–Au coordination number of 1.6, consistent with the formation of small amounts of Au(0). These Au(0) species have previously been demonstrated to be large (>1 nm) and inactive in acetylene hydrochlorination
26
. LCF analysis of the XANES spectrum of the used catalyst (Fig.
3b
) confirmed the presence of 14% Au(0).
