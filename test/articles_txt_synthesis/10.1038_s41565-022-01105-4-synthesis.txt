Catalyst preparation
All carbon-supported metal-based catalysts (nominal metal loading 1 mass%), denoted M/C, were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method, employing the respective metal chloride and aqua regia
34
,
37
, HCl or deionized water as solvent
39
. The obtained solutions were added dropwise onto the carbon carriers (that is, polyaniline-derived NC
45
or commercial AC (Norit ROX 0.8). Subsequently, all samples were dried at 473 K (heating rate = 5 K min
−1
, 16 h, static air) to yield the respective SA catalyst, denoted M-SA/NC or M-SA/AC. In the case of Au, Pt and Pd, M-SA-N
4
/NC catalysts were obtained by thermal activation of the respective M-SA/NC sample (

= 1,073 K, heating rate = 5 K min

). The NP-based catalysts (M-NP/NC for Ru, Rh and Ir, and M-NP/AC for all metals) were derived by thermal activation in the temperature range
T

= 523–1,073 K (heating rate = 5 K min

). The catalysts are denoted M/C-
