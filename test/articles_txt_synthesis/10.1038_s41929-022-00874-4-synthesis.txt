O (total amount of Co, Ce and Zr was 5 mmol) were added to 16 ml of ethanol. After stirring for at least 2 h at room temperature, the homogeneous sol was transferred to an oven at 40 °C. After 48 h of ageing, the gel product was dried at 100 °C for 24 h. Calcination was carried out in air by slowly increasing the temperature from room temperature to 500 °C at a rate of 1 °C min

Small cobalt nanoparticles were synthesized using wetness impregnation with a cobalt (tris)ethyleneamine precursor. Catalysts were dried at 110 °C in air overnight and then pyrolysed in a helium flow at 350 °C for 4 h. Before catalytic activity tests, catalysts were reduced at 300–500 °C in H
