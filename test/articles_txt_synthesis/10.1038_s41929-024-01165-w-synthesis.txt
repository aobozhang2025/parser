Synthesis of MC material
MC was prepared by the metal-assisted carbonization method, in which catechol was used as a typical host for the encapsulation of sublimable Zn species to form the corresponding catalyst precursor. Catechol (1.3 g, 12.0 mmol), nano-fumed SiO

O (2.1 g, 7.0 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (150 ml) were loaded in a round-bottom flask (500 ml) and stirred for 6 h at room temperature. After the removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation, the remaining powder was dried overnight at 80 °C and then carbonized at 1,000 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min

under an Ar atmosphere. After that, the carbide was immersed in HF (40 wt%) solution for 72 h to remove the soluble species and impurities. Finally, the solid was collected by filtration, washed with deionized water five times and then dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 h. The resulting sample was labelled as the MC material.
