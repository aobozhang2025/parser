(MAX phase). In detail, commercial powders of molybdenum (Sigma Aldrich, 99%), titanium (325 mesh, 99%, Alfa Aesar), aluminium (325 mesh, 99.5%, Alfa Aesar) and graphite (7–11 μm, 99%, Alfa Aesar) were mixed with a molar ratio of Al/C/Ti/Mo of 1.1:1.9:1:2. The mixture was loaded into a graphite die coated with boron nitride. Next, the graphite die was transferred into a spark plasma sintering system (Fuji-211lx) where it was sintered at 1,450 °C for 60 minutes and subjected to a uniaxial pressure of 30 MPa. The synthesized Mo
