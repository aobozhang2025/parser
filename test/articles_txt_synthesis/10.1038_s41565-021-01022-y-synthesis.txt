O (12.75 g) and 2-methylimidazole (29.15 g) were dissolved separately in deionized water (1,000 ml). Then the two aqueous solutions were rapidly mixed and vigorously stirred for 2 h. The resulting white precipitate was left undisturbed for 12 h. The product was collected by centrifugation, then washed with water and ethanol, and subsequently dried at 80 °C overnight. To prepare NC, the 2D-ZIF-8 (5 g) was mixed with KCl (100 g) in deionized water (400 ml) and then dried under rotary evaporation. After drying (120 °C overnight), the KCl intercalated powder was heated to 700 °C (heating rate, 2 °C min

) for 5 h in a nitrogen flow. The product was washed with hydrochloric acid (2 M), deionized water and ethanol, then dried at 80 °C overnight.

The synthesis of other metal UHD-SACs follows the same steps by using the appropriate metal precursor, solvent, annealing temperatures and atmospheres (Supplementary Table

).
Automated synthesis
The automated catalyst preparation was carried out in a Chemspeed Flex Isynth synthesis platform. The distinct carriers (100 mg) were dispensed into the reaction block using an in-built extruder for precision dosing. After addition of ethanol (5 ml, ACS reagent grade, Millipore Sigma), the nickel precursor solution (NiCl

The resulting slurries were shaken (300 r.p.m.) for 30 min, and the solvent was subsequently removed under vacuum (80 °C, 7 h). The dry powders were transferred to ceramic boats and annealed in flowing nitrogen (20 ml min
