O (0.03 mol) and 24.0 g imidazole were mixed and stirred in 600 ml deionized (DI) water. Then, 1,200 ml 0.3 M NaOH was dropped into the aforementioned mixture with a titration speed of 60 ml min

. After 6 h of stirring, the mixture was vacuum filtered and washed until neutral pH. The residual yellow powder was freeze dried and named as NiNC-IMIdazolate precursor.
Synthesis of imidazolate-derived NiNC
The NiNC-IMI precursor was placed in a tube furnace and annealed at 800 °C for 3 h (ramping: 5.0 °C min

The pyrolysis was carried out in a furnace with a ramp of 30 °C min

at 90 °C for overnight was performed to remove the excessive Ni particles. In this synthesis, four heat treatments and three acid washes were performed in turn, and the catalyst is obtained after the fourth pyrolysis (pyrolysis/acid washing, pyrolysis/acid washing, pyrolysis/acid washing and pyrolysis).
