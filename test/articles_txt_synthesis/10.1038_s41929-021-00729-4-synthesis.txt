. Copper nitrate and aluminium nitrate were dissolved in deionized water, and the precipitating agent was added dropwise into the solution at 60 °C under vigorous stirring. The mixture was aged overnight and filtered, with the precipitate dried at 100 °C for 12 h. The catalyst powders were finally calcined in static air at 450 °C for 4 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy surface analysis and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry confirmed the absence of residual Na in the catalyst.
