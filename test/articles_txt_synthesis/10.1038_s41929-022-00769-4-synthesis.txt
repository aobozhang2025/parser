Synthesis of Pd/ND catalysts
Six Pd/ND catalysts with distinct palladium geometries and dispersion states were synthesized by varying the palladium weight loadings or wet-chemistry synthetic methods. For the synthesis of Pd

/ND (

= 1, 2), typically, 200 mg ND (99.9% purity, Beijing Grish Hitech) was first dispersed in 45 ml deionized water in a 100 ml round-bottom flask, followed by 30 min sonication to achieve a homogeneous suspension. Then, the flask was immersed into a 100 °C oil bath after the pH value of the ND suspension was adjusted to ~10 by using freshly prepared Na

solution (0.25 M). Afterwards, 5 ml of freshly pH-neutralized Pd(NO

solution of various concentrations was added dropwise to the stirring ND suspension and kept at 100 °C for 1 h under continuous stirring. Finally, these as-prepared Pd/ND samples were dried under vacuum at 60 °C after washing twice with deionized water.
The synthesis of samples with larger crystalline palladium NPs as the dominant geometries (that is, Pd

/ND,

= 1, 2, 3) was realized by either the incipient-wetness impregnation method (Pd

/ND and Pd
p3
/ND) or chemical reduction methods (Pd
p2
/ND). For the synthesis of Pd
p1
/ND, 200 mg ND was wetted by 800 μl diluted Pd(NO

)

solution in a 10 ml crucible, then the slurry was stirred slowly at room temperature overnight and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. For the synthesis of Pd

/ND, 800 μl diluted Pd(NO

solution with an additional 120 mg citric acid was used to wet 200 mg ND. Afterwards, the slurry was stirred at room temperature overnight and dried at 120 °C for 12 h. The synthesis of Pd
p2
/ND was based on a previous publication with some modifications

. In a typical synthesis, 540 μl PdCl

–HCl solution (10 mg PdCl

dissolved in 1 ml 0.4 M HCl) was mixed with 0.30 mmol trisodium citrate in 80 ml deionized water, then 200 mg ND was added to the above solution, followed by 30 min sonication to achieve a homogeneous suspension. A newly prepared 10 ml NaBH

solution (0.1 M) was then added dropwise to the above suspension under stirring at 60 °C and the stirring was continued at 60 °C for 6 h. Finally, the as-prepared sample was washed three times with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
After drying, different catalyst precursors were reduced by diluted H

) at 573 K (except for Pd

/ND, for which the reduction temperature was set at 473 K to prevent the aggregation of Pd

sites) for 1 h, followed with passivation treatment at room temperature with diluted O

(0.5 % O

) for 12 h.
