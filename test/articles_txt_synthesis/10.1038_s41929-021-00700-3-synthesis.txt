aqueous solution (0.125 M) under vigorous stirring at room temperature. After 10 min, the precipitation was collected via filtration, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried under a reduced pressure. The yielded white powder was transferred into an alumina crucible and calcined at 500 °C (the ramping rate was controlled at 2 °C min

Synthesis of Ir-based catalysts
(Acetylacetonato)(1,5-cyclooctadiene)iridium(I) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Pentane was dried using an MBraun solvent purification system (SPS 800), and stored in the presence of 4 Å molecule sieves in a glove box. Synthetic air and H
