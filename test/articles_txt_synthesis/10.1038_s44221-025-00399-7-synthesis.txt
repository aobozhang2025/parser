-phenanthroline were added to ethanol, and the mixture was stirred well to evenly distribute the components and then ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then, magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)

) was added to the mixture, which was ultrasonicated for another 30 min and then dried using a rotary evaporator. The obtained solid was dried in an oven at 60 °C and then calcined in nitrogen at 700 °C. The calcined product was washed with 1 M nitric acid, centrifuged and dried to obtain Fe–N–C. Similarly, Co–N–C was synthesized using essentially the same method but with cobalt acetate instead of Fe(acac)

samples were prepared using a simple method, as detailed in the Supplementary Information.
Pollutant degradation for wastewater treatment
The model pollutant solution or wastewater was first prepared, and a certain amount of Fe–N–C was added. If necessary, the pH of the reaction solution was adjusted to the target value using NaOH or HCl. The mixture was stirred well to evenly distribute the components, and PMS was then added. At the required time, the sample was removed from the reaction solution, filtered and detected in a timely manner.
Long-term degradation experiment
The catalyst (20 mg) was introduced before the start of the reaction. To 100 ml of the reaction solution, 20 mg l
−1
of phenol and 20 mg of PMS were added during each reaction cycle, and the phenol concentration in the reaction solution was measured at the end of each cycle. Three long-term degradation cycles were conducted daily. When the catalyst became deactivated, it was washed with ethanol and reused for pollutant degradation.
Measurement of CODs for catalyst and reaction solution
For measuring the COD of the solution, 3 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and filtered, and 2 ml of the filtrate was used as the sample. For measuring the COD of catalyst, 50 ml of the reaction mixture was membrane filtered, and the powder was collected and ultrasonically redispersed in an equal volume of pure water. Subsequently, 2 ml of the dispersion was used as the sample for measuring the COD.
