bimetallic clusters encapsulated in the MFI zeolite have been successfully synthesized to improve the stability of Pt clusters, resulting in a high PDH performance. However, the real active sites for these two kinds of bimetallic PDH catalyst are different. Sun et al. proposed that the catalytically active species had the structure of a Pt–Zn alloy, with the PtZn

alloy clusters exhibiting the best PDH performance
15
. By contrast, Liu et al. proposed that Pt and Sn possibly existed in the form of the Sn–O–Pt bond in the K-PtSn@MFI catalysts prepared

For zeolite-confined Pt catalysts, the as-prepared Pt

(M = Sn, Zn, among others) species tend to evolve into the less active PtM alloy during high-temperature pre-reduction or the PDH reaction operated above 550 °C. For example, we have shown that active Pt

alloy under either harsh pretreatment (calcination–reduction or direct reduction) or long-term reaction processes due to the unstable skeleton-Sn species, which leads to the eventual catalyst deactivation
24
. Furthermore, for the Sn-Beta-confined Pt catalysts, the location of the Pt species in the zeolite framework is hard to control due to the random distribution of skeleton-Sn species. Thus, alternative strategies are required to control the placement of guest Pt while inhibiting the reduction of framework heterometal atoms; moreover, zeolites with larger pores are needed to provide improved diffusion and accommodation capability for the guest metal source during wet-impregnation processes. As elements in the same group, the framework Ge
4+
ion is more difficult to be reduced than the Sn
4+
ion. Thus, the germanosilicate zeolites with abundant framework Ge
4+
ions and extra-large pores are considered to be better candidates as the carriers
25
,
26
. However, they exhibit poor hydrothermal stability even at room temperature due to easy hydrolysis of the Ge–O bonds, which greatly limits their use. This does, however, endow them with structurally modifiable properties

. In particular, the assembly–disassembly–organization–reassembly (or ADOR) process can selectively destroy the double-four-membered-ring (d4r) subunits in germanosilicates to obtain two-dimensional (2D) layered intermediates

; however; only specific zeolite structures with a modifiable interlayer structure are applicable for this approach.
Here we use an alternative strategy without any structural transformation during the process of encapsulating metals. We use a thermally/hydrothermally stable UTL-type germanosilicate (Ge-UTL), obtained via acidic treatment, as an alternative support to confine the Pt species, aiming to take advantage of its extra-large 14-membered-ring (14-MR) pores, high content of stable skeleton-Ge species and the specific d4r subunits. The Pt@Ge-UTL catalyst was readily prepared from the Ge-UTL carrier and H

via simple wet impregnation and subsequent H

reduction. The special d4r building units and the Ge ions enriched therein cooperate synergistically to limit the location of Pt in the 14-MR channels, generating encapsulated subnanometric Pt clusters with ultra-high stability and a high PDH performance.
Results
Confining subnanometric Pt clusters in UTL-type zeolites
The aim of this study lies in the construction of a confined metal catalyst that demonstrates a heat-resistant structure, high porosity and subnanometric Pt clusters scattered in a well-defined location. To this end, a series of UTL-type zeolites with various Si/Ge atomic ratios (that is, 31–227) and stable skeleton structures were prepared to serve as the Pt supports. These were prepared via acid pickling of the as-made Ge-UTL (Si/Ge = 4.7) (for detailed information see Supplementary Note
1
, Supplementary Figs.
1
–
7
and Supplementary Table
1
), during which both structure protection by the organic structure-directing agents inside the pores and skeleton stabilization through replacement of the Ge atoms (mainly in the d4r units) with Si atoms was realized
36
. We used a calcined sample of the pristine Ge-UTL (named as UTL-C) as well as calcined samples of several acid-pickling-stabilized materials as the Pt supports, which were treated via simple wet impregnation, using chloroplatinic acid as the Pt precursor, all with the same Pt loading of 0.375 wt%. Supplementary Figure

shows the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-impregnated precursors without H
2
reduction (where the suffix ‘P’ indicates the pristine sample, that is, before reduction). The crystalline structure of pristine UTL-C which has a high germanium content (Si/Ge = 4.7) was extremely unstable, and the UTL topological structure was destroyed after Pt impregnation in the aqueous system as a result of extensive hydrolysis of the skeleton Ge. Nevertheless, the supports prepared via acid pickling for ≥2 h endured Pt impregnation well as they possessed a highly stabilized skeleton structure. In addition, the textural properties of surface area and pore volume showed consistent results (Supplementary Fig.
9
and Supplementary Table
2
). Compared with the pristine UTL-C sample, Pt impregnation led to a sharp decrease in the specific surface area and micropore volume for Pt-UTL-C-P. By contrast, the materials stabilized by acid pickling for ≥2 h maintained their porous structure well during Pt impregnation.
The inhibition of particle sintering and aggregation against high-temperature reduction is always preferred in the preparation of Pt nanoparticles or subnanoparticles. In our case, the Ge-UTL germanosilicates with a large skeleton-Ge content and a stabilized structure are promising to highly disperse and stabilize the Pt species. The PXRD patterns demonstrated that the final catalysts prepared from stabilized supports retained the original UTL structure and possessed a comparable crystallinity (Fig.
1a
). Most importantly, no obvious diffraction attributed to large Pt particles was observed for these target catalysts after further H
2
reduction (Fig.
1a
), indicating that the Pt species are highly dispersed in the Pt-A-2h(31)

13
, with an increasing reduction temperature, the diffraction peaks related to the Pt and PtGe species remained invisible even after reduction at 600 °C, indicating that Pt or its bimetallic species formed with Ge was too small in size to be detected using the X-ray diffraction technique. These results strongly imply that the Pt species are highly dispersed and confined in the matrix or pores of the zeolite supports. The Pt-A-24h-twice(227)-R catalyst was an exception and it showed a weak and broad diffraction of Pt(111) (Fig.
1a
, 5), because the amount of skeleton Ge was not sufficient to immobilize and disperse the Pt species.

Source data
Full size image
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed to visually determine the size of the Pt species. No visible metal particles were observed in the reduced Pt-A-2h(31)
-
R sample when the images were obtained with a normal mode at either low or high magnification (Fig.
1b,c
, respectively). For Pt-A-3h(44)-R, Pt-A-6h(52)-R and Pt-A-12h(58)-R with lower amounts of Ge, although the PXRD patterns did not show any Pt-species-related diffraction peaks, metal nanoparticles of 2–4 nm in size were detected in the TEM images at low magnification (Fig.
1d–f
). With a prolonged acid-pickling time, the Ge content is gradually decreased, while the detectable metal particles increased in both number and particle size. In particular, the Pt-A-24h-twice(227)-R sample prepared using the quasi-UTL-type silicate (Si/Ge = 227) as the carrier possessed much larger Pt nanoparticles (3–8 nm) that were unevenly distributed on the surface of the zeolite crystals (Fig.
1g
). Therefore, it is impossible to confine the Pt species within the matrix or pores of a Ge-UTL zeolite that lacks sufficient skeleton-Ge species.
Subsequently, spherical-aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-corrected HAADF-STEM) revealed the presence of ultra-fine Pt clusters of 0.2–0.8 nm in size in the Pt-A-2h(31)-R sample (Fig.
1h–k
and Supplementary Fig.
14a
). The observed cluster sizes correspond to several Pt atoms, consistent with the in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results, which confirm that the Pt clusters in Pt-A-2h(31)-R comprise, on average, four Pt atoms (see EXAFS analysis in the later section on identification of the active species in Pt@Ge-UTL). The diffuse HAADF-STEM image contrast observed in some regions can be attributed to the fact that the Pt clusters separated along the projection direction appear to merge together in the projected image (Supplementary Fig.
14b
) and should not be mistaken for larger particles. Similar illusions are actually common in the HAADF-STEM imaging of supported ultra-fine-cluster (or single-atom) noble metal catalysts
11
,
15
. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy elemental mapping reveals that Ge and Pt are uniformly distributed throughout the zeolite crystal (Fig.
1l,m
). In summary, the Ge-UTL zeolite that contains sufficient skeleton-Ge species and a highly stable crystalline structure is a suitable support for achieving dispersed Pt loading.
To characterize the electronic state of Pt, infrared spectroscopy has been used widely to study carbon monoxide (CO) adsorbed on Pt. The CO vibration bands vary with their adsorption states (linear or bridged adsorption), which are closely related to the chemical environments of the Pt sites. The size and possible position of the Pt species in zeolites can therefore be quantitatively determined
16
,
35
,
37
,
38
,
39
. In situ infrared spectra with the CO probe molecule were collected for the Pt-supported UTL catalysts (Supplementary Fig.
15a
). The linear adsorption of CO molecules on the surface of Pt species emerged for all the samples, although notably different bands were shown due to the varying proportions of Pt species with distinct chemical environments
37
. The band at 2,048 cm
−1
is assigned to CO adsorption on the step or kink sites of the Pt(111) surface of large nanoparticles
38
, indicating the presence of large Pt species or particles on the external surface of the zeolite crystals
35
. The bands at 2,079 cm
−1
and 2,010 cm
−1
can be attributed to the symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching of Pt(CO)
2
species, respectively, where the confined subnanometric Pt is coordinated by two CO molecules
16
. For further confirmation, we demonstrated the distribution by simulating the adsorption of CO on a theoretical structural model of Pt(111) (simulating the superficial Pt nanoparticles) and on Pt@UTL (Supplementary Fig.
15b,c
, respectively). These theoretical calculations confirmed that the three adsorption peaks of 2,048, 2,079 and 2,010 cm
−1
are ascribed, respectively, to CO linearly adsorbed on Pt(111) (simulating the superficial Pt nanoparticles) as well as the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching modes of the Pt(CO)
2
species. In particular, the two CO molecules in the Pt(CO)
2
species are coordinated to Pt atoms that are not interacting with the zeolite framework of the zeolite-channel-confined subnanometric Pt clusters. The relative intensity of each vibration band shows a good correlation with the adsorption capacity of CO on Pt, and thus the ratio of Pt species at the different positions can be determined based on the band intensity. The Pt-A-2h(31)-R sample showed the strongest absorption band at 2,010 cm
−1
, indicating that almost all the Pt species were confined inside the UTL channels. However, when the Ge content in the carriers decreased successively with elongation of the pickling time, more Pt nanoparticles were located on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, thus providing an intense band at 2,048 cm
−1
. Particularly in the case of the Pt-A-24h-twice(227)-R sample that is almost Ge-free, the 2,048 cm
−1
band dominated the infrared spectrum of CO adsorption, verifying that it contained numerous large-sized Pt species existing on the crystal surface rather than in the channels.
Similar results have also been demonstrated through a quasi in situ investigation using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary Fig.
16
). The Pt 4
f
signal intensity of Pt-A-2h(31)-R was extremely weak and negligible in comparison with Pt-A-24h-twice(227)-R. The Pt species in the Pt-A-2h(31)-R sample were almost undetected using the XPS surface-
