at a molar ratio of 3:1) were mixed in 150 ml of 1 M HCl and sonicated for 2 h. Carbon black (0.4 g; Cabot, BP2000) was then added and dispersed by stirring for 18 h under room temperature to ensure uniform distribution. Next, the mixture was dried by using a rotary evaporator and the remaining powder was collected. The powder was annealed in a flowing Ar/H

(5% H

) atmosphere at 900 °C for 2 h and then annealed in air at 250–550 °C (450 °C as the optimized temperature) for 3 h. After annealing, 50 mg of product was added to 20 ml of 1 M HCl and mixed at room temperature for 12 h to perform acid leaching, then centrifuged and washed with deionized water three times. Finally, the sample was dried at 80 °C in an oven for 12 h to obtain the Ni-RuO

-AL samples with different amounts of Ni dopant were also prepared following the same procedure, except that the level of precursors was tuned in the first step. In addition, RuO
