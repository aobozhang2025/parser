Synthesis and pretreatment
The 0.0025% SAC was prepared by wet impregnation. The MgAl
2
O
4
support (Puralox MG 28, Sasol) was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h before impregnation. Deionized water (20 ml) was added to a Pyrex bottle and the pH was adjusted with nitric acid to 2.8. The Ir nitrate precursor (8.7 wt% Ir, Furuya Metal Co.) was added into the pH-adjusted solution. The MgAl
2
O
4
support was then added into the solution while stirring. The final pH of the solution was 9.5. The nominal Ir weight loading was 0.0025%. After 12 h of stirring, the solution was filtered out and the solid sample was dried in air for 24 h at room temperature. The sample was then dried at 80 °C and 100 °C before calcination at 500 °C for 4 h. The Ir in the solution after filtration was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and no Ir was detected. The 1% Ir/MgAl
2
O
4
samples were synthesized by incipient impregnation. The proper amount of Ir nitrate precursor was added to the MgAl
2
O
4
support (Puralox MG30, Sasol) drop by drop, and the sample was then dried at 80 °C and 100 °C (at 0.5 °C min
−1
) for 4 h respectively. The dried sample was then calcined at 500 °C in air for 4 h. The 0.2% Ir/MgA
2
O
4
NP sample was prepared by wet impregnation. The proper amount of Ir(CO)
2
(acac) (Sigma Aldrich) precursor was dissolved in 8 ml of toluene (Sigma Aldrich) in a 20 ml vial while flowing N
2
at room temperature. Then the dissolved Ir(CO)
2
(acac) toluene solution was injected into another vial containing 5 g MgAl
2
O
4
(Puralox MG 28, Sasol) under N
2
flow. The sample was then dried under N
2
flow at room temperature overnight to evaporate the toluene. No calcination was performed on this catalyst. The CO and acac ligands were removed in situ by treatment in H
2
at 500 °C, which led to the formation of 1 nm NPs as detailed in the Results.
