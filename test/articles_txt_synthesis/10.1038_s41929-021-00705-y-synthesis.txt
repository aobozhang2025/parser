Synthesis of CoPc/CNT
CoPc/CNT was synthesized following an analogous protocol reported in the literature
73
. CoPc (1 mg) was mixed with 30 mg of a multiwall CNT in 30 ml dimethylformamide solution and stirred for 24 h. The suspension became transparent. The final suspension was washed using EtOH and H
2
O within a centrifuge to remove the dimethylformamide, and after that was freeze-dried to give the final catalyst.
Electrode preparation
Carbon paper (1 cm × 2.5 cm, Freudenberg C2H23) was sonicated in ethanol and deionized water for 15 min and dried as the electrode substrate. The catalyst ink was prepared using 4.0 mg of catalyst mixed with 60 μl of Nafion solution (5% in ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 μl of isopropanol and 200 μl of deionized water. After 15 min of sonification, the ink was deposited on the microporous layer of carbon paper to achieve an area of 1 cm
