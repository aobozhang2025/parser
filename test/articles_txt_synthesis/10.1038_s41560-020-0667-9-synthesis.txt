, 8 g). The reaction mixture was then heated to 70 °C and kept for 3 h with magnetic stirring and argon protection. The black mixture was then partitioned between water (150 ml) and dichloromethane (DCM, 150 ml). The aqueous phase was separated and extracted with DCM (200 ml × 3). The solvents of the combined organic phase were removed under reduced pressure and the product was purified by flash chromatography with DCM as the eluent to give 4-methoxyphthalonitrile (2.7 g, 73% yield). 4-Methoxyphthalonitrile (2.7 g) and nickel acetate tetrahydrate (1.35 g) were then added to a Schlenk flask equipped with a stir bar, followed by adding 50 ml of sulfolane. After several cycles of vacuum and refilling with argon, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (0.6 ml) was added, followed by another three cycles of vacuum and refilling with argon. The reaction mixture was heated to 160 °C and kept for 10 h. The mixture was then precipitated from methanol (400 ml) and the collected solid was subjected to Soxhlet extraction. The solid was further extracted by DMF several times and the solvent of combined DMF solutions was removed to obtain NiPc–OMe (600 mg, 18% yield). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (

. 1,2,4,5-Tetracyanobenzene (1.0 g) and nickel acetate tetrahydrate (0.4 g) were added to a Schlenk flask equipped with a stirring bar, followed by adding 20 ml of sulfolane. After several cycles of vacuum and refilling with argon, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (0.2 ml) was added, followed by another three cycles of vacuum and refilling with argon. The reaction mixture was heated to 135 °C and kept for 6 h. The reaction mixture was precipitated from methanol (400 ml) and the collected solid was subjected to Soxhlet extraction. The solid was further extracted by DMF for several times and the solvent of combined DMF solutions was removed to yield NiPc–CN (410 mg, 38% yield). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (

Preparation of MPc MDEs
NiPc and CoPc were obtained from Alfa Aesar. To prepare MPc MDEs, 30 mg CNTs (C-Nano, FT 9000) were dispersed in 20 ml DMF by high-power sonication for 1 h (Xinzhi SB-5200D, 360 W). A calculated amount of the original or substituted NiPc/CoPc was dissolved in 10 ml DMF with high-power sonication and added to the CNT suspension. The mixed suspension was sonicated for another 30 min and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. NiPc has low solubility in DMF, and thus the high-power sonication step is important for mixing. The MPc MDE materials were separated by centrifuge and washed with DMF, ethanol and water (Milli-Q water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C was used throughout the experiments), followed by lyophilization to obtain the final products.
Synthesis of P-NiNC
The synthesis adopted a previous report with minor modifications

. Briefly, zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.9 g) and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (0.9 g) were dissolved in 120 ml methanol. The solution was then mixed with 2-methylimidazole (2.0 g dissolved in 40 ml methanol) and stirred at room temperature for 18 h. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 8,000 r.p.m. for 6 min to collect the precipitate, which was further washed with methanol three times and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The solid was subjected to heat treatment at 1,000 °C (at a ramping rate of 5 °C min

) in a tube furnace for 3 h under 100 sccm argon flow. The black power was used directly without any further treatments.
