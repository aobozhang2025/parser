synthesis of C

alcohols from alternative carbon resources such as coal, natural gas and biomass via syngas (a mixture of CO and H

) has attracted long-standing interest

. This route requires multiple elementary reaction steps, including dissociative CO activation to form alkyl species (CH

, subsequent product separation and purification can be highly energy demanding. The delicate control of the above competing elementary reactions to exclusively produce a specific C

oxygenate, especially at high CO conversions, is highly desirable for practical applications but remains extremely challenging.
Ethanol (EtOH) is an essential commodity chemical with a global demand of 100 billion gallons annually

. Direct conversion of syngas to EtOH requires only one step of C–C coupling, thus holding great potential for high selectivity. Incorporating transition metal or alkali metal promoters into documented Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS)

is an effective approach to improve EtOH selectivity, while the highest EtOH selectivity in total oxygenates achieved so far was approximately 53% at a CO conversion of 10%, to the best of our knowledge (Supplementary Table

and achieved a markable EtOH selectivity of ~60% in oxygenates at a CO conversion of ~8% (ref.

reported a remarkably high EtOH selectivity of 95% in oxygenates at a CO conversion of 5.7% over tri-component tandem catalysts of K

, thus largely promoting the productivity of a specific C

alcohol with high selectivity.
In this Article, we report that the precise assembly of Rh-ZrO

and Rh-FeO

interfaces in atomic-scale proximity on tetragonal zirconia (

) enables efficient tandem conversion of syngas to EtOH. The resulting dual-interface catalyst broke the activity–selectivity trade-off and achieved a high EtOH selectivity of up to 90% in oxygenates at an appreciable CO conversion of 51% as well as a high EtOH space-time yield (STY) of 668.2 mg g
