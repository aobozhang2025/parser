. A solid mixture of fresh Ni
5
(50 mg) and W
10
(100 mg) was suspended in DMF-H
2
O (3:1, 4 ml) solution in a 10 ml vial. The sonication steps take approximately 5 min to obtain a solution. After the solution was heated at 100 °C for 24 h and cooled to room temperature, green crystals of
Ni
5
W
10
were obtained, and the yield was 75% (based on Ni
5
). The CCDC number of
Ni
