synthesis of Ir

/CN, for example, we chose zeolite imidazolate framework 8 (ZIF-8) as the host and iridium acetylacetonate (Ir(acac)
3
) as the guest molecule due to its diameter (
d
i
= 9.8 Å) being between those of ZIF-8 pores (
d
p
= 3.4 Å) and cavities (
d
c
= 11.6 Å). We mixed a Ir(acac)
3
/Zn(NO
3
)
2
methanol solution with a 2-methylimidazole methanol solution to in situ-encapsulate Ir(acac)
3
within ZIF-8 during ZIF-8 crystallization. Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra of Ir(acac)
3
and Ir(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 showed consistent bands in the 290–325 nm and 415–450 nm ranges, which suggests that Ir(acac)
3
was encapsulated within ZIF-8 (Supplementary Fig.
1
). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments revealed rhombododecahedron-shaped Ir(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 nanocrystals (Supplementary Fig.
2
). The X-ray-diffraction pattern of Ir(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 was well matched with that of ZIF-8 (Supplementary Fig.
3
), indicating that Ir(acac)
3
did not disturb ZIF crystallization.
