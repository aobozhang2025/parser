Finally, the solid was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C overnight, after which the supernatant was almost transparent, indicating the successful loading of palladium nanoparticles on the support.
Catalytic evaluation
Single-batch reaction system
Typically, 5 mg photocatalysts and 0.1 mmol toluene were dispersed in 2 ml acetonitrile and transferred into a 10-ml quartz tube with continuous stirring. Then, O

was steadily bubbled through the solution. The photocatalytic reactions were performed on a WATTCAS Parallel Light Reactor (WP-TEC-1020HSL), using an 8-W, 400–405-nm purple LED, which was integrated with a water circulation system that maintained the temperature constant at 25 °C (room temperature). The light power density was measured through direct contact with the light source by an optical power and energy meter (Thorlabs-PM 100D) as 130 mW cm

. After irradiation for a specified time, the mixture was collected and the photocatalysts were separated by centrifugation. The obtained supernatant was detected and quantitatively analysed by GC–MS with an electron capture detector (Thermo Trace GC Ultra) and GC with a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC 2010 Plus).
Flow reaction system
Generally, 37.5 mg photocatalysts and 0.75 mmol toluene were thoroughly dispersed in 15 ml acetonitrile by sonication. Then, the mixture was transferred to a vessel with continuous stirring and water cooling to guarantee a constant room temperature (25 °C). Subsequently, the mixture was pumped into the photochemical flow reaction reactor (9 ml liquid hold-up volume) via a peristaltic pump. Meanwhile, the compressed air was introduced and controlled by a flow meter to form monodispersed bubbles in the reactor channels. After the specified reaction time, the mixture was collected and centrifuged, and the contents finally detected and analysed.
The flow reaction device is fitted with a 405-nm LED panel as the light source. This panel was clamped to the device and its light power density was measured through direct contact with the light source by an optical power and energy meter (Thorlabs-PM 100D) as 120 mW cm
