. Generally, heather leaves were used for the CD preparation based on a simple hydrothermal crystallization, and the synthesis of the CDs could be scaled up easily. In our strategy, CDs with small sizes and high surface-to-volume ratios were critical to achieve a high loading of atomically dispersed metal atoms. As such, we modified the reaction temperature and time to adjust the size distributions of CDs. Finally, CDs with particle size ranging from 5 to 10 nm (measured by HR-TEM) were obtained after hydrothermal crystallization, cooling, centrifugation, filtering and freeze-drying.
Synthesis of UHDNi–N–C SACs

, with deionized water as the solvent) under continuous stirring to obtain a homogeneous solution. The obtained solution was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, followed by freeze-drying for 8 h. Next, the as-prepared solid powders were mixed with urea and thiourea, then ground into a homogeneous precursor. The optimized masses of urea and thiourea (mass ratio, 7:1) were determined based on many investigations. The powders were placed in a tubular quartz tube and heated at a rate of 5 °C min
