Synthesis of multi-M-SACs
We also used the same synthesis processes to prepare multi-M-SACs, including binary NiCo-SAC/SBA-15, ternary NiCoMn-SAC/SBA-15, quaternary NiCoMnZn-SAC/SBA-15, quinary NiCoMnZnCu-SAC/SBA-15, senary NiCoMnZnCuSc-SAC/SBA-15 and septenary NiCoMnZnCuScFe-SAC/SiO

, with the only difference being that the corresponding multiple metal salt precursors were simultaneously used for multi-M-SACs.
Synthesis of Ni catalyst with embedded nanoparticles
The Ni catalyst with embedded nanoparticles was prepared for comparison. Its synthesis process was similar to that of the various SACs. However, for synthesizing Ni catalyst with embedded nanoparticles, SiO

hard templates were not used, and thus the step of alkaline leaching was omitted.
