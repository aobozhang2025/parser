synthesis of single-atom catalysts at higher temperatures naturally grants a higher thermal stability, but high-temperature synthesis (>1,000 °C) is typically challenging to achieve and incompatible with many temperature-sensitive methods and materials.
In this work, we report the use of high-temperature shockwaves to synthesize and stabilize single atoms at very high temperatures (for example, 1,500–2,000 K). The high-temperature shockwave is achieved using a programmable, periodic on–off heating pattern that features a short on state (for example, ~1,500 K for ≤55 ms) and a ten-times longer off state (near room temperature). The on state provides the activation energy for single-atom dispersion by forming thermodynamically stable metal–defect bonds that can naturally sustain high-temperature annealing, which we confirmed with in situ microscopy as well as theoretical simulations. The longer off state critically ensures the overall dispersion stability by preventing an extended heating-induced metal vaporization and particularly substrate deterioration. The high-temperature-synthesized single atoms (HT-SAs) demonstrate a superior stability in direct methane conversion for 50 hours and are also hydrothermally stable after steam treatment at 973 K.
Shockwave synthesis of thermally stable single atoms
As a demonstration, we began with the synthesis of Pt HT-SAs on CO
2
-activated carbon nanofibre (CA-CNF) substrates. As schematically shown in Fig.
1a
, ethanol-based salt precursors (H
2
PtCl
6
) are loaded onto the defective CA-CNFs (loading of 0.01 µmol cm
–2
, normalized to the geometric area) with good wetting. The precursor-loaded CA-CNF film was then subjected to shockwave heating via an electrical Joule heating process that can be easily programmed in terms of temperature, on–off durations and repeated cycles (Supplementary Fig.
1
). The thermal images captured by a high-speed camera show a uniform spatial temperature distribution during the shock-heating process (Supplementary Fig.
2
). Figure
1b
shows the temperature evolution of a pulse heated to ~1,500 K for 55 ms and then rapidly quenched by directly cutting off the input current for a ten times longer period, which leads to an average temperature of ~400 K for the overall process. Figure
1c
shows the temperature profile with ten heating cycles over a 6 s period, which demonstrates the relatively stable temperature that can be repeatedly achieved during the heating process. In addition, we can achieve a temperature of up to ~3,000 K (Supplementary Fig.
2c
), which allows us to synthesize thermally stable HT-SAs at very high temperatures.

Figure
1d,e
shows the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images of Pt dispersed on the CA-CNF substrate after one and ten heat shocks at 1,500 K. For a single heat shock, the surface of the CA-CNFs was dispersed with high-density single atoms, although Pt clusters were also visible (Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
3a
). However, after ten shocks, the substrate displayed a mostly uniform single-atom distribution (Fig.
1e
and Supplementary Fig.
3b
), which indicates the stability of these HT-SAs and the further disassembly of clusters into single atoms during the continuous shockwave heating. We further confirmed the single-atom dispersion by macroscopic extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (Fig.
1f
) and X-ray near-edge structure analysis (Supplementary Fig.
3c
). The EXAFS spectrum of the one-cycle sample shows a weak peak at ~2.5 Å, which corresponds to the Pt–Pt bonding, and a dominant peak at ~1.5 Å, which indicates the Pt–substrate bonds (the Pt–C bond, as discussed later), to reveal a structure of Pt nanoclusters mixed with single atoms. After ten cycles, nearly no Pt–Pt bonds remained, which suggests the dominance of single-atom dispersion by disassembling the remaining clusters. The CA-CNF substrate had a surface area of ~56 m
2
g
–1
and the Pt loading was measured as ~0.24 wt%. We also varied the metal loading and found that nanoclusters form at a higher (5 times and 10 times) loading (Supplementary Fig.
4
shows the cases of 0.05 and 0.1 µmol cm
–2
) owing to limited stabilization sites.
To understand the dispersion mechanism, we designed control samples using different heating strategies (Supplementary Fig.
5a–c
). Low-temperature synthesis (573 K, 1 h) lacks the activation energy to effectively disperse and bond these atoms to the substrate (that is, poor dispersion and stability), whereas high-temperature annealing (1,500 K, 10 min) leads to a serious particle agglomeration due to overheating-induced (1) graphitization of the carbon substrate (that is, the losing of defects)
32
and (2) long-range atom diffusion. Therefore, the shockwave heating creatively utilized high temperatures for HT-SAs synthesis but was short enough to avoid the deterioration to the substrates, and thus maintained the stability of the single-atom dispersion.
In addition, the defects are important to help bind these mobile single atoms onto the substrate and improve their structural stability (Supplementary Fig.
5d–f
). Experimentally, shockwave synthesis on the relatively crystalline CNF (without CO
2
activation) yields nanoclusters mixed with single atoms due to the limited defective sites. In contrast, after activation, the improved defect concentration and presence of micropores (that is, carbon vacancies) on CA-CNFs (Supplementary Figs.
6
and
7
) lead to a high-density single-atom dispersion. Accordingly, a more defective substrate can accommodate a high density of single atoms. Therefore, these control experiments illustrate the critical role of high-temperature shockwave heating and of defects on the substrate for an effective single-atom dispersion and stabilization.
The HT-SAs naturally possess a superior structural stability because they were synthesized at a high temperature of 1,500 K, which we confirmed by in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) from room temperature up to 1,273 K (the equipment limit). The sample was stabilized for at least 30 minutes before taking images. As shown in Fig.
2a
, the Pt HT-SAs displayed a uniform and high-density single-atom dispersion at each temperature up to 1,273 K after holding for 60 minutes. In addition, we also confirmed the stability of the Pt HT-SAs by performing ex situ thermal annealing at 1,073 K for 1 hour in a furnace with an Ar flow (Supplementary Fig.
8
). As the shockwave method can produce a temperature of up to 3,000 K (Supplementary Fig.
2c
)
33
, this could enable the synthesis of HT-SAs at an even higher temperature. As an example, we synthesized HT-SAs at 1,800 and 2,000 K (using a lower (half) loading of 0.005 µmol cm
–2
) and observed the stable single-atom dispersion proved by both STEM and EXAFS measurements (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Fig.
9
).

For comparison, in Fig.

we summarize previous reports of single atoms synthesized using various methods.

30
. However, the much higher temperature of our shockwave method surpasses furnace heating with the ability to synthesize single atoms up to 1,500–2,000 K. In addition, a higher-temperature synthesis provides ultrafast kinetics for single-atom dispersion with extremely shorter processing durations (<10 s) and a higher efficiency compared to low-temperature methods.
Analysis of the single-atom bond structure
The thermal stability of HT-SAs comes from the Pt–substrate bond’s ability to resist high-temperature annealing. Experimentally, we analysed the bond structure by extracting the nearest-neighbour coordination numbers and the local structure of the Pt HT-SAs from fitting the EXAFS profiles with first-shell model (Table
1
and Supplementary Fig.
10
). Figure
3a
shows a typical EXAFS fitting of Pt 1,500 K HT-SAs, which renders a bond distance of 1.931 Å and a coordination number of 2.8 (indicating a Pt–X
3
bond configuration). The experimentally derived bond length is considerably shorter than the literature reported Pt–O (2.01–2.05 Å) (refs.
10
,
34
) and Pt–N bonds (~2.3 Å) (ref.
35
), but it is in good agreement with a Pt–C bond that has a calculated bond length of 1.93 Å (ref.
36
). Moreover, based on this Pt–X

bond model, we calculated the bond distance of Pt–C in Pt–C

3b
), which confirms the Pt–C bond structure in our samples.

The DFT result also reveals that the bonding energy of Pt–C bonds is surprisingly higher than that of Pt–N bonds under the similar bond configurations (Pt–X
3
and Pt–X
4
) (Supplementary Fig.
11a
). In addition, the charge density difference diagrams further illustrate the difference between Pt–C and Pt–N bonds: in Pt–C bonds, a large amount of charge transfer appears between the Pt and C atoms and the charge density is mainly concentrated in the centre, which indicates a strong covalent bond nature; however, in Pt–N bonds, the transferred electron is mainly circulated around the Pt and N atoms, which denotes an ionic bond (Supplementary Fig.
11b
). Therefore, the Pt–C bonds demonstrate a higher binding energy and a unique covalent nature compared with Pt–N bonds in a similar bond configuration.
High-temperature dispersion and stabilization
To understand the atomistic origin of the high-temperature-induced dispersion and stabilization, we performed molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using the reactive force field (ReaxFF) potential
41
,
42
(details in
Supplementary Methods
). The defects on graphene contain randomly etched carbon vacancies to mimic the surface of CA-CNFs. Figure
3c
clearly depicts the dispersion of Pt clusters into single atoms with increasing heating cycles at 1,500 K (from (i) to (iii)), as well as the dispersion stability on thermal annealing at 1,500 K (iv). We observed both the agglomeration and atomization of Pt atoms, but the atomization can only be stabilized when energy-favourable Pt–C bonds are formed (types 4–10 in Fig.
3d
). Figure
3e
shows the evolution of bond structures before and after a shockwave at 1,500 K, in which all the initial weak bonds (Pt–Pt cluster and types 1–3 Pt–C bonds) change into stronger Pt–C bonds (types 4–10) with higher binding energies, which illustrates the atomic origin as to why the HT-SAs are more thermally stable than Pt clusters. The simulation clearly reproduced our synthesis process in which the initial Pt clusters are weakly attached with the substrate, but with more shockwave heating, the clusters are disassembled into single atoms by forming thermodynamically stable Pt–C bonds that can sustain high-temperature annealing. This also indicates defects on the substrates are essential to stabilize HT-SAs and determine the dispersion density.
In the process, high temperature is critical to provide sufficient activation energy for atom diffusion and overcome the energy barrier for bond formation. As an example, when a single Pt atom deviates from a Pt-30 cluster to form a Pt–C bond, kinetically there is an energy barrier (for example, 1.48 eV) that hinders the dispersion, which can only be overcome at a high temperature (Fig.
3f
and Supplementary Fig.
12
). We also simulated the shockwave dispersion at other temperatures: 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 2,500 K (Supplementary Fig.
13
). Although similar shockwave patterns (on/off ratio and cycle numbers) were applied, low temperatures (500 and 1,000 K) failed to fully disperse the Pt cluster within the given repeated cycles. In contrast, higher shockwave temperatures had improved kinetics and achieved single-atom dispersion much faster, that is, gave a much higher dispersion efficiency (Fig.
3g
). Moreover, the Pt–C bond distribution in these HT-SAs shows an increasing proportion of more stable type 5–10 bonds at higher synthesis temperatures, which indicates an improved thermal stability (Fig.
3h
). Therefore, high-temperature synthesis is critical for single-atom dispersion and stabilization as it provides the essential activation energy to accelerate the dispersion process and promote the formation of bonds that are more stable.
Generality of the shockwave synthesis and catalytic study
The simple shockwave synthesis method can generally be applied to other metals and substrates in which a high temperature enables the atom dispersion by forming stable metal–defect bonds while the shockwave heating helps maintain the overall stability. As the shockwave temperature is sufficiently high compared with the thermal decomposition temperatures of most metal precursors, our method can be used to produce single-atom dispersions of most metals, as demonstrated of Ru and Co HT-SAs on CA-CNFs (Fig.
4a
and Supplementary Fig.
14
).

In addition, the shockwave method can be extended to other substrates, such as conductive reduced graphene oxide, semiconductor C
3
N
4
and oxides like TiO
2
, but with a different heating method (Supplementary Fig.
15
) and forming different bonds with the substrates (Supplementary Fig.
16
). Radiative shockwave heating can be used for powder samples by depositing precursor-loaded powders beneath a carbon film that was Joule heated in a shockwave pattern. The high temperature achieved in the film also heated the C
3
N
4
powder and induced a high-density single-atom dispersion (Fig.
4b
). In addition, the shockwave heating maintained the structural integrity of C
3
N
4
, which otherwise would be easily carbonized by prolonged heating (Supplementary Fig.
17
). The non-contact radiative heating can also be scaled up easily for a continuous production (Supplementary Fig.
18
). Alternatively, as oxides have a poor thermal conductivity for effectively radiative heating, we achieved Pt HT-SAs on TiO
2
substrates by depositing a thin layer (~2.5 nm) of TiO
2
on the nanofibres in a CA-CNF film via atomic layer deposition (Supplementary Fig.
15c
). The shockwave heating of the CA-CNF film also heated the TiO
2
layer through conductive heating and induced the single-atom dispersion on TiO
2
(Fig.
4c
). These results demonstrate the generality of the high-temperature-shockwave method for synthesizing thermally stable single-atom dispersions, which suggests a great potential for scalable nanomanufacturing.
To test the stability of our HT-SAs, we first performed an in situ hydrothermal test for Pt HT-SAs on CA-CNFs in an environmental TEM (ETEM) at a partial H
2
O pressure of 10
−3
mbar from 300 to 773 K (the upper limit is to avoid equipment corrosion), with each studied temperature held for at least 30 minutes. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
19
, no nanocluster emerged during the in situ measurement up to 773 K, which proves the HT-SAs are stable. We further confirmed the performance stability of the Pt HT-SAs in the CO oxidation reaction before and after hydrothermal treatment using 5% H
2
O at 973 K for four hours, which corroborates the hydrothermal stability of the Pt HT-SAs (Fig.
4d
). The Arrhenius plots measured by kinetic studies (Fig.
4e
) also show that the apparent reaction energies of the Pt single-atom catalysts before and after the steam pretreatment are very close (50.7 kJ mol
–1
versus 53.2 kJ mol
–1
). In addition, we performed multiple cycles of the CO oxidation measurements (Supplementary Fig.
20
), as well as a stability test at 493 K for 50 hours, and both confirmed the high stability of the Pt HT-SAs (Fig.
4f
).
Additionally, we demonstrated that the HT-SAs have a reductive catalytic application in direct methane conversion, in which single-atom catalysts exhibit good performances due to the coke resistance by preventing catalytic C–C coupling

,
44
. A control sample was synthesized via a conventional impregnation (that is, IMP) method by using the same material but thermally reducing it at 573 K for one hour (Supplementary Fig.

(>90%) for Pt HT-SAs and no coke formation for extended 50 h. In contrast, the Pt IMP sample shows severe coke formation even during the first hour of reaction, which could be ascribed to the continuous ensembles and aggregation of Pt sites at a high temperature (973 K). Figure
4h
shows the superior stability of the Pt HT-SAs in CH
4
conversion with a stable turnover frequency (TOF) for 50 h, in contrast to the quick drop of TOF for the Pt IMP sample due to its dispersion instability at a high temperature and aggregation into nanoclusters. Note that our HT-SAs demonstrate a roughly 1,000-times higher TOF than the Pt nanocluster supported on SiO
2
catalysts reported in the literature under similar conditions
43
, which manifests the criticalness and great efficiency of single-atom catalysts. These practical results demonstrate the superior thermal stabilities of HT-SAs synthesized by high-temperature shockwaves and their great potential for catalytic applications.
Conclusion
We report a high-temperature-shockwave method to synthesize and stabilize high-density single atoms at very high temperatures with a great efficiency. The shockwave design enables a high-temperature (1,500–2,000 K) synthesis during the on state; however, the average temperature is significantly lower (for example, 400 K) as a result of the extended off times, which makes the method compatible with various substrates and manufacturing. Control experiments and simulation results revealed the critical roles of high-temperature synthesis, which provides the activation energy and ultrafast kinetics for single-atom dispersion and promotes a more-stable bond formation with the defects on the substrates. We confirmed the high-temperature stability of the HT-SAs by in situ (stable up to 1,273 K) and ex situ STEM (shockwave stability up to 1,500–2,000 K). We also demonstrated the stability of HT-SAs in CO oxidation and in direct methane conversion over 50 hours. The shockwave method is facile and general for synthesizing various thermally stable single atoms on different substrates, which provides a route for single-atom manufacturing to give high-temperature catalytic reactions.

CNF substrates were derived from polyacrylonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) by electrospinning an 8 wt% polyacrylonitrile in dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich) solution at a voltage of 15–20 kV, a spinning distance of 10 cm and a feed rate of 1 ml h

. The nanofibre mat was first stabilized in air at 533 K for 5 h and carbonized at 1,273 K for 2 h in Ar to create the CNF sample. The CNF material was then thermally annealed under a CO

atmosphere (80 ml min

) at 1,023 K for 3 h (CA-CNF). Reduced graphene oxide was synthesized according to a modified Hummer’s method

Shockwave synthesis
The salt precursors were dissolved in ethanol-based solutions at a dilute concentration (0.0001–0.0005 mol l
–1
), and the solutions were directly dropped onto the suspended CNF films with a loading of 20–100 μLcm
–2
(in total ~0.01 μmol cm
–2
) and left to dry (room temperature, 30 min). The precursor-loaded CNF films were then subjected to the shockwave synthesis in an Ar-filled glovebox using a programmable electrical pulse (Keithley 2425). The pulse temperature, duration and on–off ratio were easily adjusted by the programming in the Keithley 2425 system (the sweep function) or by an external control software. A high-power d.c. source (Volteq, 1,200 W) was also used when a high input power was needed. The programmable pulse heating o the high-power electric source was controlled by Keithely through a relay.
To estimate the temperature evolution during the shockwave process, a homemade colour ratio pyrometer measurement was performed using a Vision Research Phantom Miro M110 high-speed camera. Detailed temperature calculations are given in a previous paper
46
. MATLAB was used to extract the raw pixel values to calculate the temperatures. For the figures that show the temperature of a single sample as a function of time, only unsaturated pixels above the black level and within the error threshold were used to report the mean and median temperature of the frame for a contiguous area of at least ten acceptable pixels.
