nanoparticles (Alfa Aesar, 5-nm APS Powder) and 6.78 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate were dispersed and dissolved into a 150-ml methanol solution. The other 150-ml methanol solution contained 7.88 g of 2-methylimidazole. Both solutions were mixed and heated at 60 °C for 24 h. The precipitant was then collected by centrifuging, washed with ethanol three times, dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight, and finely ground to prepare the Fe
