Catalytic tests
The dynamic temperature-programmed and the steady-state activity tests of the non-oxidative methanol self-coupling were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz microreactor (6 mm outer diameter, 4 mm inner diameter) at atmospheric pressure. CH

DFT calculations
AIMD simulations were carried out in two stages, cooking and quenching. Cooking was simulated with the canonical ensemble using a Nosé–Hoover thermostat

, a time step of 1 fs and 2,000 ionic steps for a total duration of 2 ps and at a temperature of 500 K. The quench stage allowed for the decrease of kinetic energy by decreasing the temperature according to the following equation: temperature = beginning temperature + (ending temperature – beginning temperature) × (number of the current step)/(total number of ionic steps). Our beginning temperature was 500 K (to simulate the reaction temperature) and our ending temperature was 300 K (RT). In each step, a microcanonical ensemble was simulated. Similar to the cooking stage, the quench stage employed a time step of 1 fs with 2,000 ionic steps to give a total duration of 2 ps. This theoretical set-up allowed us to sample a vast variety of structures along simulation trajectories that were able to surpass energy barriers between local minima of energy. The configurations that corresponded to energy minima from the quench stage were used as the input for standard DFT energy minimization calculations, and occasionally they equilibrated into more stable structures than the starting configurations fed to the AIMD simulation stages.
