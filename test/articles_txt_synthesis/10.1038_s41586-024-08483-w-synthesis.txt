Elemental analysis of catalysts
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy was used to determine the concentrations of metal elements in the sample series using a Prodigy 7 instrument. Before analysis, the samples were dissolved in aqua regia and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature.
X-ray diffraction
X-ray diffraction patterns were acquired on a PANalytical Powder X-ray diffractometer using a Cu-Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 40 mA. Before analysis, the samples were subjected to passivation to ensure stability under ambient conditions.
Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms
Analyses were performed at −196 °C using an ASAP 2020 Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry System. The samples were pretreated under a dynamic vacuum for 12 h to eliminate guest molecules and adsorbed moisture. Passivation was performed before analysis to maintain stability in an air atmosphere.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization was conducted on an aberration-corrected Nion HERMES-100 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV with a convergence semi-angle of 32 mrad. The collection semi-angles for STEM-HAADF imaging and EELS chemical mapping were 75–210 mrad and 0–75 mrad, respectively. The energy dispersion of EELS was set to 0.39 eV per channel or 0.89 eV per channel. As the low-dispersion settings have an inevitable nonlinearity of the energy dispersion at the two ends of the spectrometer prism, the onsets of the La L
3
edges were shifted to 832 eV to correct the slight offsets of the absolute energy-loss values. The EELS spectra shown in Fig.

and Supplementary Figs.
12
and
13
were normalized by integrating the signals within the energy-loss range of 800–820 eV. The EELS analyses of other elements were carried out in the same manner with La. The catalyst samples were embedded in resin and sectioned into approximately 30 nm slices using ultramicrotomy for STEM-EELS characterization. Moreover, a subset of STEM-HAADF images, EELS spectra and EDS spectra were obtained using aberration-corrected FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 and JEOL GrandARM2 microscopes operating at 300 kV and 200 kV with the convergence semi-angles of 25 mrad and 32 mrad, respectively. For STEM-EDS analysis, the samples were prepared by depositing ethanol-sample suspensions onto grids coated with holey carbon film.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
Quasi-in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of various catalysts were measured on an Axis Supra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical) using a monochromatized Al Kα radiation source. After activation or reaction, all catalysts were transferred to the measurement chamber without exposure to air. XPS with tunable photon energy for Pt/γ-Mo

N and Pt/La-Mo

N catalysts were acquired at beamline BL02B01 at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The activated samples were transferred to the chamber under the protection of Ar in a glove bag. For XPS measurements at SSRF, the typical X-ray spot size is about 120 μm (H) × 15 μm (V) and the incident angle is 15°, giving an elongated X-ray beam projection of around 460 μm (H) × 15 μm (V) on the sample. All these XPS spectra were processed using CasaXPS software.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy

-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra were measured at the beamline 1W1B of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility, which operates at 2.5 GeV with a current of 250 mA, and beamline BL14W1 SSRF, which operates at 3.5 GeV with a current of 350 mA. An Si(111) double crystal monochromator was used. The data were acquired in fluorescence mode using Lytle or a 19-element Ge solid-state detector as detectors. The samples were sealed in Kapton films under an argon atmosphere following activation and transferred to a glove box without air exposure. The XAS data were processed and analysed using the Demeter software package

Raman spectroscopy
Raman experiments were performed on a Horiba JY HR800 Raman spectrometer, whereas in situ and quasi-in-situ experiments were conducted using a Horiba LabRAM HR Raman spectrometer. The excitation laser wavelength was 532 nm.

The methanol–water temperature-programmed surface reaction experiments use a similar experimental procedure as CH

OH temperature-programmed desorption, except for the adsorption stage. The water-to-methanol molar ratio in the liquid phase was maintained at 5:1 to ensure that the partial pressure of water was slightly higher than that of methanol in the gas phase at 30 °C.
Transient kinetic analysis

N (M = La, Pr, Cs, and Sr) catalysts at 100 °C. TKA setup is equipped with a dual-channel tube furnace with a reactor tube and a bypassing tube, and an online mass spectrometer system
9
. A four-way valve with an air actuator allowed for the switching of reaction gases between the reaction tube and the bypass tube. The reactor tube was loaded with 20 mg of passivated catalyst, whereas the bypass tube was not. After reduction, the TKA experimental procedures were started. First, 10 ml min

H

O:Ne:Ar = 1:4:75 was performed quickly without any pressure fluctuation, and the transient signals were recorded by an online mass spectrometer. Finally, after 20 min, the 10 ml min

−1
Ar. Until the signals stabilized, the water TKA experiments were repeated (Fig.
3d
).
In the experiments, when the fresh catalyst initially contacts with water, it undergoes both reversible and irreversible adsorption processes. For the irreversible adsorption part, a fraction of the water molecules dissociate, producing hydrogen in the effluent, and hydroxyls on the surface of the catalyst
37
. In the subsequent second water TKA experiment, as the catalyst interacts with water for the second instance, merely reversible adsorption happens, and no obvious production of hydrogen is observed. By subtracting the water signal (
m
/
z
= 18) of the first round of TKA experiments from that of the second TKA experiment, the amount of irreversible water adsorption under this specific reaction condition can be obtained (Fig.
3e
). By calibrating the signal of H

(
m
/
z
= 2) and H
2
O (
m
/
z
= 18) relative to Ar (
m
/

3f
).
Theoretical calculations
All calculations were executed within the density functional theory (DFT) framework using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (refs.
37
,
38
). The projector-augmented wave method was used to describe the interaction between the ions and electrons. Electron–electron exchange and correlation interactions were characterized using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional within the generalized gradient approximation
39
. A plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV and Gaussian electron smearing with a sigma of 0.02 eV was used to ensure accurate energies. The structures were relaxed using either the conjugate gradient algorithm or the quasi-Newton scheme until forces on all unfixed atoms were less than 0.01 eV Å

.
The γ-Mo

crystallographic symmetry was used. The calculated lattice parameters (4.17 Å) closely matched the experimental data (4.16 Å). A six-atom-layer slab modelled the γ-Mo
2
N (111) surface. Vacuum thickness was set to 15 Å to separate the slab in the
z
directions, which was sufficient to avoid electronic coupling between adjacent slabs in test calculations. During geometry optimization, atoms in the bottom two layers were fixed as those in the bulk structure, whereas atoms in the four upper surface layers and the adsorbate were relaxed. For the methanol-reforming mechanism calculation, γ-Mo

According to the aforementioned definition, a negative value signifies an exothermic process, whereas positive values indicate endothermic processes. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functionals were combined with D3 dispersion corrections to account for dispersion force fields
37
. Furthermore, vibrational frequencies were used to compute the zero-point energies of adsorbate intermediates and free molecules. Note that the energies of all configurations presented in this work include corrections for dispersion (D3) and zero-point energy.
