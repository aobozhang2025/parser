–NG(R) catalyst
GO was washed with hydrochloric acid solution and acetone to remove the metal impurities (for example, manganese) that are left during the Hummers method of producing GO (Supplementary Table

). It was then dried in an electric oven at 40 °C overnight. In a typical approach, 30 mg of acid-treated GO was dispersed in 30 ml of water. CoCl

O was dispersed in water (3 mg ml

) and 202 ul of the solution was added into the GO solution. The mixed solution was sonicated for 1 h and then freeze-dried for 2 days. The prepared metal-adsorbed GO foam was collected into an alumina crucible and then placed at the centre of a tube furnace. With the continuous feeding of ammonia (50 sccm) and argon (150 sccm) gas, the furnace was heated up to 500 °C (ramping rate = 5 °C min

) and held at 500 °C for 1 h, followed by natural cooling under a continuous flow of Ar (150 sccm). The collected dark greyish catalyst was dispersed in isopropanol (1 mg ml

) for further use. The synthetic method for Co

–NG(R) was the same as that for Co

–ZIF(O) catalyst
ZIF-8 (Basolite Z1200 from Sigma-Aldrich) powder (1 g) was annealed at 900 °C for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere (yield ~0.32 g) in a tube furnace to obtain ZIF-derived carbon. The ZIF-derived carbon (200 mg) was dispersed in 50 ml water and sonicated for 30 min. Cobalt acetate (177 mg) and 1,10-phenanthroline (594.6 mg) were dissolved in 15 ml of water. Then, 1 ml of this solution was added to the ZIF-derived carbon solution and the mixture was sonicated for another 30 min, followed by stirring for 24 h. After this, the powder was collected by filtration and was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The dried powder was annealed at 900 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere to produce Co
