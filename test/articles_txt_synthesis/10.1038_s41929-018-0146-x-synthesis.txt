synthesis of these materials often require tedious procedures and lack appropriate interactions between the metal atoms and supports. Here, we report a simple and practical strategy to access the large-scale synthesis of single-atom catalysts via direct atoms emitting from bulk metals, and the subsequent trapping on nitrogen-rich porous carbon with the assistance of ammonia. First, the ammonia coordinates with the copper atoms to form volatile Cu(NH

, suffer from low yields and high costs that are not favourable for large-scale production. The chemical routes involve tedious synthetic processes, including the adsorption of metal precursors, followed by reduction and stabilization on defect-rich supports

. The reported chemical synthesis routes are also relatively difficult to scale up because of the complex operating steps and sensitive conditions. Furthermore, under a high reactive temperature, aggregation and sintering of small nanoparticles and single atoms on the support is inevitable to some extent, which greatly hinders the practical applications of SACs. Therefore, the development of a practical and straightforward strategy for the synthesis of SACs with high thermal/chemical stability and ease of mass production is particularly attractive in the field.
In a recent interesting and pioneering example, Datye and co-workers described the preparation of platinum single atoms supported on CeO

. In contrast with the synthesis of SACs from nanoparticles, studies of the direct fabrication of SACs from cheap and readily available bulk metal materials have rarely been reported.
Here, we describe a facile gas-migration strategy to directly transform bulk materials into single atoms onto a support with great potential for large-scale production. A schematic of the reaction is shown in Fig.

: copper foam and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) were placed separately in a porcelain boat. The formation mechanism of copper single atoms supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu-SAs/N-C) is proposed in Fig.

. First, the ZIF-8 was subjected to a pyrolysis process under an argon atmosphere at 1,173 K, forming pyrolysed ZIF-8 with empty zinc nodes and abundant defect sites. Under an ammonia atmosphere, ammonia molecules haul the surface copper atoms out of copper foam to form volatile Cu(NH
