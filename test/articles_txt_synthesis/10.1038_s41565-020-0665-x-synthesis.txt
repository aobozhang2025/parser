Typical preparation of SA-Rh/CN (3 h), Rh/CN-2h, Rh/CN-4h, Rh/CN-5h, Rh/CN-1100 SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN
Rh/ZIF-8 (1 g) was added to a crucible. The crucible was then placed in a tube-type furnace and heated to 900 °C for 2–5 h (1,100 °C for 6 h to prepare Rh/CN-1100) at a heating rate of 5 °C min

atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, SA-Rh/CN (black powder) was obtained. The product could be used directly without further treatment.
The same procedure was utilized for the synthesis of SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN by using Pd/ZIF-8 (1 g) and Pt/ZIF-8 (1 g), respectively, instead of Rh/ZIF-8 (1 g).

solution. After 5 min, black nanocrystals were collected by centrifugation. Rh nanoparticles were washed with ethanol three times and dried at 70 °C. Vulcan XC-72 (100 mg) was added into 100 ml ethanol. Under vigorous stirring, 20 mg prepared Rh nanoparticles were added to the suspension at room temperature then stirred continuously for 4 h. The catalyst was collected by centrifugation. Rh/C was dried at 70 °C for 12 h to remove the solvent, then the solid was used for electrochemical measurements without further purification.
