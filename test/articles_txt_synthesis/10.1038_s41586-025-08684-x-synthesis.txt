synthesis of 5 wt% ceria/alumina sample. Commercial samples with nominal 8% and 50% ceria supported on gamma alumina were supplied by BASF. Commercial sample with about 25 wt% ceria–zirconia on alumina (zirconia to ceria weight ratio approximately 60:40) was supplied by BASF. Commercial pure gamma alumina powder with surface area about 180 m

Polyhedral ceria nanoparticles were prepared by decomposing cerium nitrate in the muffle furnace at 650 °C (referred to as standard ceria nanoparticles).
To prepare the loadings of Rh on supports of 0.1 wt% and 0.5 wt%, the desired amount of Rh precursor (rhodium nitrate hydrate; Sigma) was dissolved in the minimum amount of water (total volume approximately equivalent to the pore of support) and added with a micropipette to the desired amount of sample while continuously stirring with the spatula to ensure uniformity. The obtained powder was dried under N

flow at 80 °C and then calcined at 600 °C for 1 h in a normal muffle furnace with a ramp rate of 5 °C min

. The as-prepared Rh-containing catalysts were pressed, crushed and sieved to 60–80 mesh.
The analogous synthesis method was used to prepare the desired amounts of Pt on supports: platinum tetramine nitrate (from Sigma) was used as a Pt precursor.
Catalytic experiments
Catalytic experiments were conducted in a plug-flow reactor system with powder samples (120 mg, 60–80 mesh) loaded in a quartz tube, using a synthetic gas mixture containing 460 ppm of NO and 1,750 ppm of CO balanced with N

Concentrations of reactants and products were measured by an online MKS MultiGas 2030 FTIR Gas Analyzer with a gas cell maintained at 191 °C. Two four-way valves were used for gas switching between the reactor and the bypass. The heating rate was 4 K min

A light-off curve was also obtained after exposing the catalyst to reducing treatment with CO at 375 °C (for 30 min), as it was previously shown to improve the CO oxidation reactivity of Pt/ceria catalysts. CO oxidation activity was the best for reactive-treated sample. NO oxidation activity was the best for reactive-treated sample.
