(10.0 mmol) were dissolved in 70 ml distilled water. The solution containing precursors was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 ml). Subsequently, it was sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 20 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The resulting product was washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. Under an Ar flow of 100 sccm, the dried product was heated to 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C min

Electrochemical measurements
The OER measurements including cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry polarization curves were performed using a CHI 760D workstation (CH Instruments) with a counter electrode of a graphite rod (diameter, 5 mm; 99.999%) and a reference electrode of Hg/Hg

Electrode fabrication
A piece of copper (Cu) foam was sonicated in acetone, ethanol and distilled water for several minutes, prior to the preparation of the electrode. Some 15 mg MoS
2
-based catalyst was added into a mixture of 0.90 ml ethanol and 100 μl Nafion (Dupont, 5 wt%) with 1 h ultrasonic treatment. Some 100 μl fresh catalyst ink was dropped onto a piece of Cu foam (0.5 cm × 2 cm; the surface area of the catalyst deposited on the electrode is 0.5 cm
2
) and dried at room temperature for 12 h. All tests were performed in 1.0 M KOH solution saturated with oxygen gas (O
2
). For a comparison, 10 mg IrO
2
catalyst was added into a mixture of 0.90 ml ethanol and 100 μl Nafion with 1 h ultrasonic treatment. Some 100 μl of fresh catalyst ink was dropped onto a piece of Cu foam, and the loading of IrO

on the Cu foam was 1 mg cm

. The samples were run for ten cycles to reach a steady state. The linear scan voltammetry measurements for the MoS

and IrO

catalysts were recorded in O

. Cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded from 0.37 to 0.57 V versus RHE with a scan rate of 10 mV s

to measure the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (

). The long-term stability was measured by chronoamperometric response under magnetic stirring. OER performances under different magnetic fields were performed by tuning the distances between the electrode and magnets. Seawater was collected from Sentosa beach (Singapore), and filtrated by filter paper.
The Cu foil loaded with the catalyst (0.2 mg cm
−2
) acted as the work electrode (anode), and the Pt wire was the cathode. Ten neodymium magnets (one magnet, 3 cm × 2 cm × 0.5 cm) were stacked and placed near the anode of the water splitting cell. The magnetic field experienced by the electrode was carefully calibrated using a Gauss meter (TD8620, Shenzhen; Supplementary Fig.
53
). A large water splitting cell was constructed using two 6 cm × 10 cm carbon papers loaded with Ni

(3 mg cm

were treated as valence states for Mo, S, Ni, O and H atoms, respectively. According to the experimental Ni loading concentration, the 4 × 4 × 1 supercell of MoS

with one Mo atom replaced by a Ni atom was used to simulate the doping effect. A vacuum slab of 16 Å was added to avoid the interlayer interaction. The structures were relaxed with a 2 × 2 × 1 gamma-centred k-point mesh for the supercell, and the electronic self-consistent calculations were performed using the 5 × 5 × 1 k-point mesh. The relaxation was considered to be converged if the Hellmann–Feynman force was less than 0.01 eV Å

, and the energy convergence was set as 10

eV for all calculations with a Gaussian smearing of 0.05 eV. The gas-phase O

and H

The charge transfer was analysed by the Bader charge with a grid of 384 × 384 × 480 (ref.

). The differential electron density was also implemented to analyse the charge transfers during the adsorption process. The differential electron density was attained by the formula
$$\Delta {\rm{\rho }}={\rho }_{{\mathrm{AB}}}-{\rho }_{{\mathrm{A}}}-{\rho }_{{\mathrm{B}}}$$
where
