to synthesize the precursor MoO

. Then 0.8 g MoO

was loaded into a quartz tube reactor and placed in a vertical furnace. The powder was heated to 700 °C in NH

(100 ml min

and kept at 700 °C for 2 hours. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the gas was then switched to a CH

mixture (100 ml min

; 20/80 v/v), and the temperature was increased to 700 °C at 5 °C min

and held at 700 °C for 2 hours. Finally, the sample was passivated at room temperature using a 0.5% O

. Elemental analysis finds that the Mo/C ratio of α-MoC is around 1/0.8.

mixture (100 ml min

to 300 °C, then at 1 °C min

to 700 °C. After carburization at 700 °C for 2 hours, the sample was cooled to room temperature and passivated using a 0.5% O

mixture (15/85 v/v). The activation temperature program heated the sample to 300 °C and held it there for 1 hour. The temperature was then increased to 590 °C at a rate of 5 °C min

and held there for another 2 hours.

O was loaded onto a homemade MoO

support, using a wetness impregnation method. (To synthesize MoO

, an appropriate amount of ammonium paramolybdate was dissolved into pure water, adjusting the pH of the solution to 3.7. The solution underwent ultrasonication for 2 hours. The precipitates thus generated were separated by evaporation of solvent and dried at 60 °C under a vacuum overnight. The precipitates were then grinded into powder and calcined in air at 500 °C for 4 hours.) After being dried at room temperature under vacuum, the sample was calcined at 500 °C for 4 hours. For Pt/α-MoC, the calcined Pt/MoO
3
was carburized using the same procedure as for the synthesis of β-Mo
2
C. For Pt/MoC-2, MoO

impregnated with H

O aqueous solution was added into the ammonium paramolybdate solution dropwise under stirring. A yellow precipitant was thus generated. The solvent was evaporated at 90 °C and the precipitant was dried at 120 °C for 3 hours to ensure that the powder was dried

. Then the sample was carburized (as for β-Mo

C) directly to obtain 2%Pt/MoC-3.

before catalytic evaluation.
Pt/α-MoC catalysts with different Pt loadings
. Pt/α-MoC catalysts with 2.2 wt%, 3.1 wt%, 5.1 wt% and 7.4 wt% Pt loadings were prepared as for Pt/α-MoC. Samples with 0.2 wt% and 0.7 wt% Pt loading were prepared using the wetness impregnation method with activated α-MoC as the support. The catalysts are denoted

%Pt/α-MoC, where
