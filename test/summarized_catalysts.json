Ammonium paramolybdate ((NH\n4\n)\n6\nMo\n7\nO\n24\n•4H\n2\nO) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. A grinded powder of ammonium paramolybdate was calcined in a muffle oven to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C min\n−1\nto synthesize the precursor MoO\n3\n. Then 0.8 g MoO\n3\nwas loaded into a quartz tube reactor and placed in a vertical furnace. The powder was heated to 700 °C in NH\n3\n(100 ml min\n−1\n; pre-purified gas) at a rate of 5 °C min\n−1\nand kept at 700 °C for 2 hours. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the gas was then switched to a CH\n4\n/H\n2\nmixture (100 ml min\n−1\n; 20/80 v/v), and the temperature was increased to 700 °C at 5 °C min\n−1\nand held at 700 °C for 2 hours. Finally, the sample was passivated at room temperature using a 0.5% O\n2\n/He gas mixture\n29\n. Elemental analysis finds that the Mo/C ratio of α-MoC is around 1/0.8.\nβ-Mo\n2\nC support\n. β-Mo\n2\nC was synthesized using the same precursor as α-MoC, as follows: 0.8 g MoO\n3\nwas loaded in the quartz tube and carburized with a CH\n4\n/H\n2\nmixture (100 ml min\n−1\n; 20/80 v/v), with the temperature being increased at 5 °C min\n−1\nto 300 °C, then at 1 °C min\n−1\nto 700 °C. After carburization at 700 °C for 2 hours, the sample was cooled to room temperature and passivated using a 0.5% O\n2\n/He gas mixture.\n2%Pt/β-Mo\n2\nC catalyst\n. The passivated β-Mo\n2\nC support was transferred to a deaerated, aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of chloroplatinic acid (H\n2\nPtCl\n6\n•6H\n2\nO) to achieve the desired loading. The slurry was stirred for 3 hours, dried using evaporation, and then transferred to a freeze dryer overnight to remove any moisture. Before catalytic evaluation, the catalyst was activated with a CH\n4\n/H\n2\nmixture (15/85 v/v). The activation temperature program heated the sample to 300 °C and held it there for 1 hour. The temperature was then increased to 590 °C at a rate of 5 °C min\n−1\nand held there for another 2 hours.\n2%Pt/α-MoC and 2%Pt/MoC-2 catalysts\n. An appropriate amount of H\n2\nPtCl\n6\n•6H\n2\nO was loaded onto a homemade MoO\n3\nsupport, using a wetness impregnation method. (To synthesize MoO\n3\n, an appropriate amount of ammonium paramolybdate was dissolved into pure water, adjusting the pH of the solution to 3.7. The solution underwent ultrasonication for 2 hours. The precipitates thus generated were separated by evaporation of solvent and dried at 60 °C under a vacuum overnight. The precipitates were then grinded into powder and calcined in air at 500 °C for 4 hours.) After being dried at room temperature under vacuum, the sample was calcined at 500 °C for 4 hours. For Pt/α-MoC, the calcined Pt/MoO\n3\nwas carburized using the same procedure as for the synthesis of β-Mo\n2\nC. For Pt/MoC-2, MoO\n3\nimpregnated with H\n2\nPtCl\n6\nwas carburized directly without calcination in air at 500 °C.\n2%Pt/MoC-3 catalysts\n. An appropriate amount of H\n2\nPtCl\n6\n•6H\n2\nO aqueous solution was added into the ammonium paramolybdate solution dropwise under stirring. A yellow precipitant was thus generated. The solvent was evaporated at 90 °C and the precipitant was dried at 120 °C for 3 hours to ensure that the powder was dried\n30\n. Then the sample was carburized (as for β-Mo\n2\nC) directly to obtain 2%Pt/MoC-3.\n2%Pt/Al\n2\nO\n3\nand 2%Pt/TiO\n2\n. These reference catalysts were synthesized using wet impregnation of H\n2\nPtCl\n6\n•6H\n2\nO over commercial Al\n2\nO\n3\nand TiO\n2\nsupports\n12\n. The slurry was stirred for 3 hours in air to remove the liquid, using the rotary evaporator under vacuum at 35 °C. The material was dried at 120 °C for 3 hours, and then calcined in the muffle oven at 500 °C. The Pt loading is 2%. The catalysts were reduced with H\n2\nbefore catalytic evaluation.\nPt/α-MoC catalysts with different Pt loadings\n. Pt/α-MoC catalysts with 2.2 wt%, 3.1 wt%, 5.1 wt% and 7.4 wt% Pt loadings were prepared as for Pt/α-MoC.

Gold loadings of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 wt% were prepared by a single-step IWI of the designed amount of the gold solution. To prepare the solution, the proper amount of Au(OH)\n3\npowder was suspended in 30 ml of H\n2\nO with O\n2\nsparging and heated to 80 °C. NaOH powder (atomic ratio of Au:Na = 1:9) was added into the slurry at the same temperature. The mixture was refluxed at 80 °C overnight to obtain a transparent solution (colourless at lower concentrations to light yellow at higher concentrations). The Au\n1\n–O\nx\n–Na\n9\n–(OH)\ny\n/TiO\n2\ncatalysts were prepared by IWI of the gold solution at RT in air. The solution was concentrated by heating followed by drying at 200 °C with N\n2\nprotection, and then the sample was further dried in vacuum overnight at 80 °C.\nCatalytic tests\nThe dynamic temperature-programmed and the steady-state activity tests of the non-oxidative methanol self-coupling were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz microreactor (6 mm outer diameter, 4 mm inner diameter) at atmospheric pressure. CH\n3\nOH (10 vol%) balanced with He was used as the reactant gas with 20 ml min\n–1\nflow rate to pass through the catalyst bed, which consisted of 200 mg of catalyst and 400 mg of quartz, with a 5 °C min\n–1\nramping rate.

As MF has fragments of\nm\n/\nz\n= 32, 31, 29 and 28, the same as the cracking pattern of methanol in mass spectrometry,\nm\n/\nz\n= 60 was used as the distinct signal of MF.\nDFT calculations\nAIMD simulations were carried out in two stages, cooking and quenching. Cooking was simulated with the canonical ensemble using a Nosé–Hoover thermostat\n11\n,\n12\n, a time step of 1 fs and 2,000 ionic steps for a total duration of 2 ps and at a temperature of 500 K. The quench stage allowed for the decrease of kinetic energy by decreasing the temperature according to the following equation: temperature = beginning temperature + (ending temperature – beginning temperature) × (number of the current step)/(total number of ionic steps). Our beginning temperature was 500 K (to simulate the reaction temperature) and our ending temperature was 300 K (RT). In each step, a microcanonical ensemble was simulated. Similar to the cooking stage, the quench stage employed a time step of 1 fs with 2,000 ionic steps to give a total duration of 2 ps. This theoretical set-up allowed us to sample a vast variety of structures along simulation trajectories that were able to surpass energy barriers between local minima of energy. The configurations that corresponded to energy minima from the quench stage were used as the input for standard DFT energy minimization calculations, and occasionally they equilibrated into more stable structures than the starting configurations fed to the AIMD simulation stages.\nData availability"

                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41557-020-0446-z, catalyst preparation or (4) the stabilization of the Au in high oxidation states in the absence of water. Therefore we next investigated the use of low-polarity solvents with high boiling points such as\nN\n,\nN\n-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and cyclohexanone. The polarities, boiling points and drying temperatures along with the acetylene conversion values are reported in Table\n1\n. Although all the catalysts prepared with high-boiling-point (>120 °C) solvents performed better than the catalyst prepared in aqueous solution, they were not as active as the samples prepared with low-boiling-point solvents (<120 °C), suggesting that the drying temperature is also a parameter affecting the performance of the catalysts as well as the reducibility of the solvent at that specific drying temperature. PXRD analysis (Supplementary Fig.\n8\n) showed that the catalysts prepared at high drying temperatures contained Au nanoparticles, which is consistent with their lower activity. To probe whether the drying temperature was the only variable determining the high activity and dispersion, catalyst samples prepared with acetone were dried at 45, 65 and 140 °C for 16 h. As reported in Table\n1\n, the catalysts dried at 65 and 140 °C showed comparable activity to the sample dried at 45 °C, which demonstrates that effective catalysts can be prepared with low-polarity solvents and low drying temperatures. This suggests that it is the increased wettability of the impregnation solution on the carbon support coupled with mild drying conditions that leads to effective anchoring of single highly dispersed Au species, rather than the speciation being solely dictated by the drying temperature. Adding increasing amounts of water (5–50 vol.%) to the extra dry acetone decreased the activity of the as-prepared catalyst, as shown in Fig.\n2c\n, until at 50 vol.% the activity resembled that of samples prepared in aqueous solution. This reduction in activity correlates well with the development of reflections from metallic Au in the recorded PXRD patterns (Fig.\n2d\n). This confirms the negative impact of the presence of water on the preparation of highly dispersed Au catalysts in the absence of strong oxidizing/acidic agents or strongly coordinating ligands.\nTable 1 Acetylene conversion values for catalysts prepared with a series of low-polarity, high-boiling-point solvents\nFull size table\nA time-on-line study to compare the activity of the low-polarity Au/C-acetone catalyst with those of the Au/C-aqua regia and high-polarity Au/C-H\n2\nO catalysts (Supplementary Fig.\n9\n) showed the high stability of the Au/C-acetone catalyst under the reaction conditions. There was a small (3%) increase in conversion in the first 100 min, indicating a possible minor change in the Au oxidation state and a minimal induction period, followed by a further 140 min of steady conversion. The Au/C-aqua regia catalyst displayed a pronounced induction period due to changes in the Au oxidation state, which have been previously studied by in situ XAS, resulting in a 15% difference in conversion over the same time. The oxidizing aqua regia solvent, which has been used historically, resulted in a catalyst with a lower final conversion than that of the more benign catalyst prepared with acetone. This strongly suggests that the likely different functionality of the carbon supports can play a key role in determining the induction periods of these catalysts, through either stronger Au anchoring or facilitating changes in the oxidation state. As noted in previous work\n12\n, the Au present on Au/C-H\n2\nO is largely unreactive, being predominantly Au(0), hence this catalyst maintained a low (2%) conversion throughout the test.\nWe have previously demonstrated that 0.1 wt.% Au-S\n2\nO\n3\n/C catalysts, prepared from gold(\ni\n) thiosulfate on carbon extrudates, show high activity and productivity for acetylene hydrochlorination\n13\n. Catalysts were therefore also prepared at a 0.1 wt.% Au loading using H[AuCl\n4\n] in acetone to compare the performances of these materials at low gold loading. Under testing using undiluted gas feeds (HCl/C\n2\nH\n2\n= 1.2:1, HCl flow = 60 ml min\n−1\n, C\n2\nH\n2\nflow = 50 ml min\n−1\n, GHSV = 1,737 h\n−1\n, bed volume = 3.8 ml), the Au-S\n2\nO\n3\n/C material gave 23% conversion at 130 °C and a maximum 56% conversion at 180 °C. A 0.1 wt.% Au/C catalyst prepared from H[AuCl\n4\n] in acetone gave similar activities (27% conversion at 130 °C and 52% conversion at 180 °C) after 24 h of reaction. This is consistent with both materials containing highly dispersed gold cations. At 1 wt.% loading, the Au/C catalyst prepared from Au(\ni\n) thiosulfate also gave a comparable performance in acetylene hydrochlorination to the material prepared from H[AuCl\n4\n] in acetone.\nXAS spectra at the Au L\n3\n-edge of the Au/C-acetone catalyst before and after reaction for 4 h were recorded, analysed and compared with those of the Au/C-aqua regia catalyst and Au foil. The three Au/C catalysts reveal significantly different post-edge features in comparison with metallic Au foil (Fig.\n3a\n). This supports the findings of PXRD and STEM analyses that no extended metallic Au structures are present in the fresh catalysts prepared with acetone or aqua regia. In particular, the normalized white line heights of the fresh samples prepared with acetone and aqua regia suggest that both catalysts contain a mixture of Au(\ni\n) and Au(\niii\n) species, with the acetone catalyst being slightly more rich in Au(\ni\n) than the comparable sample prepared using aqua regia, based on a lower normalized white line height intensity (~0.66 for Au/C-acetone and ~0.78 for Au/C-aqua regia, Fig.\n3a\n). Three different Au standards were used to perform a LCF analysis of the Au L\n3\n-edge XANES spectra: Au(\niii\n) (K[AuCl\n4\n]/[AuCl\n4\n]\n–\n), Au(\ni\n) ([AuCl\n2\n]\n–\n) and a Au foil standard spectra (Fig.\n3b\n). The LCF confirmed the cationic nature of the Au in the acetone-derived catalyst, with the Au predominantly existing in the Au(\ni\n) oxidation state (77%). This is similar in nature to the catalyst prepared using aqua regia, albeit with a different distribution of Au(\ni\n) and Au(\niii\n) (57 and 43%, respectively). After 5 h of use, a small contribution from Au(0) could be detected in the Au/C-acetone catalyst, indicating a minor instability of the cationic Au species. It has been postulated that the reduction of Au species is responsible for catalyst deactivation; the stability observed in the acetylene hydrochlorination tests suggests that this agglomeration takes place during the heating ramp to the reaction temperatures and not during the reaction itself\n26\n. The EXAFS data for the fresh Au/C-acetone and Au/C-aqua regia catalysts (Fig.\n3c\nand Supplementary Table\n3\n) show Au–Cl distances and coordination numbers of 2.31(8) Å and 2.58(8), respectively, consistent with the mixed Au(\niii\n)/Au(\ni\n) speciation determined by XANES. No long-range order or characteristic Au–Au distances were observed in the EXAFS spectra of either catalyst, when compared with the Au foil standard, again in agreement with the PXRD and HAADF-STEM analyses. An increase in the intensity of the Fourier transform at distances corresponding to those of the Au foil was observed in the used catalyst, in conjunction with a decrease in the Au–Cl bond length to 2.0(1) Å and the appearance of a Au–Au coordination number of 1.6, consistent with the formation of small amounts of Au(0). These Au(0) species have previously been demonstrated to be large (>1 nm) and inactive in acetylene hydrochlorination\n26\n. LCF analysis of the XANES spectrum of the used catalyst (Fig.\n3b\n) confirmed the presence of 14% Au(0).\nFig. 3: Au L\n3\n-edge XAS"

A calculated amount of the original or substituted NiPc/CoPc was dissolved in 10 ml DMF with high-power sonication and added to the CNT suspension. The mixed suspension was sonicated for another 30 min and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. NiPc has low solubility in DMF, and thus the high-power sonication step is important for mixing. The MPc MDE materials were separated by centrifuge and washed with DMF, ethanol and water (Milli-Q water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C was used throughout the experiments), followed by lyophilization to obtain the final products.\nSynthesis of P-NiNC\nThe synthesis adopted a previous report with minor modifications\n33\n.

The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 8,000 r.p.m. for 6 min to collect the precipitate, which was further washed with methanol three times and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The solid was subjected to heat treatment at 1,000 °C (at a ramping rate of 5 °C min\n−1\n) in a tube furnace for 3 h under 100 sccm argon flow.

Briefly, a pH-adjusted solution (12.2) containing tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate was slowly injected into a solution containing TiO\n2\n(anatase, 5 nm diameter, 290 m\n2\ng\n−1\n, US Research Nanomaterials). After drying, the catalyst was calcined in a tube furnace at 450 °C for 4 h in flowing air after ramping up the temperature at a rate of 10 °C min\n−1\n.\nInfrared spectroscopy\nFTIR experiments were carried out in a diffuse reflectance reaction chamber (Harrick Scientific) equipped with ZnSe windows, mounted inside a Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance adapter (Harrick Scientific), and coupled to a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrometer with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT-A) detector. During measurements, the FTIR and Praying Mantis diffuse reflection accessory were purged with dry N\n2\n.\nElectron microscopy\nAC-STEM was performed on a JEOL Grand ARM300CF microscope equipped with two spherical aberration correctors, operated at 200 kV. HAADF-STEM images were recorded using a convergence semi-angle of 22 mrad, and inner- and outer- collection angles of 83 and 165 mrad, respectively. To minimize beam irradiation, a small beam current (<10 pA) was used for imaging, while the acquisition time was always controlled to be less than 12 s for each frame. In situ STEM experiments were performed in a Protochips Atmosphere gas cell system, which allows for dynamic observation of nanomaterials heated under atmospheric pressure inside a transmission electron microscope.\nXAS measurements\nXAS spectra were collected at beamline 9-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at the SLAC National Laboratory. In the experiments, 16 mg of 0.025 wt% Pt/TiO\n2\nwas diluted in mesoporous silica (MCM-41) and loaded into a flow-through quartz tube, with an outer diameter of 3.0 mm and an inner diameter of 2.8 mm, held at a 45° angle relative to the X-ray beam\n43\n. Fluorescence XAS measurements were collected using a Canberra 100-element Ge detector orthogonal (90°) to the beam path with 4 layers of Al foil to filter Ti fluorescence lines, as well as lead shielding to minimize contributions from scattering of beamline optics. A Pt foil reference was scanned simultaneously for energy calibration.\nThe raw data were processed using the Athena interface of the Demeter software package\n44\n. The spectra were energy-calibrated, merged and normalized. The EXAFS was extracted in\nk\n-space and Fourier-transformation was conducted on the\nk\n2\n-weighted EXAFS function (\nk\n= 3.0–12.0 Å\n−1\n) to amplify the oscillations at high\nk\n-values. Phase shifts and amplitudes for relevant back-scattering paths were calculated using FEFF6.\nKinetic control and reactivity experimental details\nAfter pretreatment and 12 h exposure at 200 °C in a feed of 1% CO, 1% O\n2\nand 98% He, temperature-dependent measurements were taken between 150 °C and 200 °C, for 2 h at each temperature. Catalyst dilution studies showed that differences in activity between the catalysts are of kinetic origins, rather than a result of mass and heat transport limitations. Partial-pressure-dependent measurements were executed at 200 °C.\nDFT computational methods\nSpin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package\n45\n. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation was used\n46\n. The self-interaction error inherent in DFT calculations was partly corrected using the DFT +\nU\napproach where the Hubbard’s\nU\nparameter was empirically set to 3 eV\n47\n. The projector augmented wave\n48\n,\n49\nmethod was used and the valence electrons explicitly treated were: Ti(3\ns\n2\n, 3\np\n6\n, 3\nd\n2\n, 4\ns\n2\n), Pt (5\np\n6\n, 5\nd\n9\n, 6\ns\n1\n), O (2\ns\n2\n, 2\np\n4\n), C (2\ns\n2\n, 2\np\n2\n) and H (1\ns\n1\n). We used a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV and the calculation was performed at the gamma point. The optimized structures were considered converged when the ionic forces were <0.01 eV Å\n−1\n.\nWe adopted the models of (3 × 1) and (2 × 1) supercell slabs including five atomic layers for the anatase TiO\n2\n(101) or the stepped TiO\n2\n(145) surfaces, respectively. A vacuum of more than 15 Å was used to avoid the interaction between slabs\n50\n. The TiO\n2\n(101) surface terminates with two types of Ti cation, five-fold coordinated Ti (Ti\n5c\n) and six-fold coordinated Ti (Ti\n6c\n), and two types of O anion, two-fold coordinated O sites (O\n2c\n) and three-fold coordinated O sites (O\n3c\n).\nCO adsorption energies were calculated as the difference between isolated species and the adsorption complexes. The CO frequencies were computed within the harmonic approximation, in which CO and its first neighbouring atoms were considered in the calculation. In the gas phase, the CO bond length (1.144 Å) and stretching frequency (2,125 cm\n−1\n) were obtained at the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof level. A scaling factor\nα\n= 2,143/2,125 = 1.0085 was applied to all frequencies to take into account the difference with respect to the experimental CO frequency in the gas phase (2,143 cm\n−1\n)."

The ZIF-derived carbon (200 mg) was dispersed in 50 ml water and sonicated for 30 min. Cobalt acetate (177 mg) and 1,10-phenanthroline (594.6 mg) were dissolved in 15 ml of water. Then, 1 ml of this solution was added to the ZIF-derived carbon solution and the mixture was sonicated for another 30 min, followed by stirring for 24 h. After this, the powder was collected by filtration and was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The dried powder was annealed at 900 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere to produce Co\n1\n–ZIF.

                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41563-024-01799-y, synthesis of high-performance ADCs. We show that light irradiation on reducible oxides leads to the accumulation of negative surface charges under the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) condition, which induce the migration of bulk V\nO\ns to form reactive surface sites (namely, Ti\n3+\n–V\nO\npairs), subsequently enabling the selective coordination and reductive deposition of metal atoms through specific interactions. The developed method for tuning photochemical surface defects can produce diverse dynamically stabilized atomic (DSA) catalysts with various supports, including various reducible oxides such as TiO\n2\n, ZnO and CeO\n2\n, and catalytically active transition metals including Pt, Ir and Cu. The utility of our synthesis method is further manifested by the optimized Pt atom catalyst on TiO\n2\n(Pt-DSA/TiO\n2\n), which exhibits unparalleled reactivity for the photocatalytic H\n2\nevolution of 164 mmol g\n−1\nh\n−1\nas well as the photoreforming of non-recyclable plastic (poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)) with an extraordinary total conversion of 98%.\nComputational study of Pt-DSA/TiO\n2\nformation process\nAt the outset of this study, we examined the mechanistic feasibility of the photochemical-defect-tuning strategy. We chose anatase TiO\n2\nas a model oxide system and investigated its defect dynamics on the synthesis of corresponding ADCs using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig.\n1\n). The computational results suggest that after light irradiation, the migration of bulk V\nO\ns to the surface is accompanied by a change in the oxidation states of adjacent Ti sites, which is expected to be thermodynamically favourable and kinetically competent (Fig.\n1a\n, left). The spin density calculation also predicts the generation of a four-coordinated Ti\n3+\nsite (4cTi) next to the migrated V\nO\ns, featured by its high spin density with the corresponding magnetic moment (0.71\nμ\nB\n) (Fig.\n1a\n, middle). The induced 4cTi site can then function as a reactive centre for the adsorption of a Pt\n4+\nprecursor followed by surface reconstruction (Fig.\n1a\n, right). The incorporation of Pt on the 4cTi site is expected to be highly favourable (−1.96 eV), showing its strong thermodynamic preference to other Pt incorporation events on different sites with the same surface V\nO\ns (Fig.\n1b\n). Considering the cohesion energy of a bulk Pt\n0\nstate from a Pt\n4+\nion (+1.52 eV), the formation of the Pt-DSA state on the 4cTi site should outcompete the agglomeration of Pt atoms. On the basis of these theoretical guideposts, we propose a simplified mechanistic scheme for the photoinduced synthesis of ADCs on TiO\n2\n. After light irradiation, excessive photoexcited electrons can be trapped at the surface sites under the photocatalytic HER condition, inducing the migration of bulk V\nO\ns to form surface Ti\n3+\n–V\nO\npairs. These Ti\n3+\n–V\nO\npairs would be highly reactive for the selective binding of metal atoms through specific metal atom–support interactions, where the localized electrons would drive surface reconstruction for formulating stable ADCs.\nFig. 1: DFT simulation of Ti\n3+\nformation at V\nO\n.\na\n, Thermodynamics of the migration of V\nO\ns to the surface and Pt adsorption by the reorganization of surface Ti ions (changes in Gibbs free energy from the leftmost structure, in electronvolts).

The high-temperature shockwave is achieved using a programmable, periodic on–off heating pattern that features a short on state (for example, ~1,500 K for ≤55 ms) and a ten-times longer off state (near room temperature). The on state provides the activation energy for single-atom dispersion by forming thermodynamically stable metal–defect bonds that can naturally sustain high-temperature annealing, which we confirmed with in situ microscopy as well as theoretical simulations. The longer off state critically ensures the overall dispersion stability by preventing an extended heating-induced metal vaporization and particularly substrate deterioration. The high-temperature-synthesized single atoms (HT-SAs) demonstrate a superior stability in direct methane conversion for 50 hours and are also hydrothermally stable after steam treatment at 973 K.\nShockwave synthesis of thermally stable single atoms\nAs a demonstration, we began with the synthesis of Pt HT-SAs on CO\n2\n-activated carbon nanofibre (CA-CNF) substrates. As schematically shown in Fig.\n1a\n, ethanol-based salt precursors (H\n2\nPtCl\n6\n) are loaded onto the defective CA-CNFs (loading of 0.01 µmol cm\n–2\n, normalized to the geometric area) with good wetting. The precursor-loaded CA-CNF film was then subjected to shockwave heating via an electrical Joule heating process that can be easily programmed in terms of temperature, on–off durations and repeated cycles (Supplementary Fig.\n1\n). The thermal images captured by a high-speed camera show a uniform spatial temperature distribution during the shock-heating process (Supplementary Fig.\n2\n). Figure\n1b\nshows the temperature evolution of a pulse heated to ~1,500 K for 55 ms and then rapidly quenched by directly cutting off the input current for a ten times longer period, which leads to an average temperature of ~400 K for the overall process. Figure\n1c\nshows the temperature profile with ten heating cycles over a 6 s period, which demonstrates the relatively stable temperature that can be repeatedly achieved during the heating process. In addition, we can achieve a temperature of up to ~3,000 K (Supplementary Fig.\n2c\n), which allows us to synthesize thermally stable HT-SAs at very high temperatures.\nFig. 1: In situ high-temperature-shockwave synthesis of HT-SAs on defective carbon.\na\n, The schematic diagram shows the HT-SA synthesis and dispersion process (grey, carbon atoms; cyan, metal precursor; red, metallic atoms).\nb\n, Temperature evolution during the shockwave synthesis and a detailed heating/cooling pattern.

For a single heat shock, the surface of the CA-CNFs was dispersed with high-density single atoms, although Pt clusters were also visible (Fig.\n1d\nand Supplementary Fig.\n3a\n). However, after ten shocks, the substrate displayed a mostly uniform single-atom distribution (Fig.\n1e\nand Supplementary Fig.\n3b\n), which indicates the stability of these HT-SAs and the further disassembly of clusters into single atoms during the continuous shockwave heating. We further confirmed the single-atom dispersion by macroscopic extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (Fig.\n1f\n) and X-ray near-edge structure analysis (Supplementary Fig.\n3c\n). The EXAFS spectrum of the one-cycle sample shows a weak peak at ~2.5 Å, which corresponds to the Pt–Pt bonding, and a dominant peak at ~1.5 Å, which indicates the Pt–substrate bonds (the Pt–C bond, as discussed later), to reveal a structure of Pt nanoclusters mixed with single atoms. After ten cycles, nearly no Pt–Pt bonds remained, which suggests the dominance of single-atom dispersion by disassembling the remaining clusters. The CA-CNF substrate had a surface area of ~56 m\n2\ng\n–1\nand the Pt loading was measured as ~0.24 wt%. We also varied the metal loading and found that nanoclusters form at a higher (5 times and 10 times) loading (Supplementary Fig.\n4\nshows the cases of 0.05 and 0.1 µmol cm\n–2\n) owing to limited stabilization sites.\nTo understand the dispersion mechanism, we designed control samples using different heating strategies (Supplementary Fig.\n5a–c\n). Low-temperature synthesis (573 K, 1 h) lacks the activation energy to effectively disperse and bond these atoms to the substrate (that is, poor dispersion and stability), whereas high-temperature annealing (1,500 K, 10 min) leads to a serious particle agglomeration due to overheating-induced (1) graphitization of the carbon substrate (that is, the losing of defects)\n32\nand (2) long-range atom diffusion. Therefore, the shockwave heating creatively utilized high temperatures for HT-SAs synthesis but was short enough to avoid the deterioration to the substrates, and thus maintained the stability of the single-atom dispersion.\nIn addition, the defects are important to help bind these mobile single atoms onto the substrate and improve their structural stability (Supplementary Fig.\n5d–f\n). Experimentally, shockwave synthesis on the relatively crystalline CNF (without CO\n2\nactivation) yields nanoclusters mixed with single atoms due to the limited defective sites. In contrast, after activation, the improved defect concentration and presence of micropores (that is, carbon vacancies) on CA-CNFs (Supplementary Figs.\n6\nand\n7\n) lead to a high-density single-atom dispersion. Accordingly, a more defective substrate can accommodate a high density of single atoms. Therefore, these control experiments illustrate the critical role of high-temperature shockwave heating and of defects on the substrate for an effective single-atom dispersion and stabilization.\nThe HT-SAs naturally possess a superior structural stability because they were synthesized at a high temperature of 1,500 K, which we confirmed by in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) from room temperature up to 1,273 K (the equipment limit). The sample was stabilized for at least 30 minutes before taking images. As shown in Fig.\n2a\n, the Pt HT-SAs displayed a uniform and high-density single-atom dispersion at each temperature up to 1,273 K after holding for 60 minutes. In addition, we also confirmed the stability of the Pt HT-SAs by performing ex situ thermal annealing at 1,073 K for 1 hour in a furnace with an Ar flow (Supplementary Fig.\n8\n). As the shockwave method can produce a temperature of up to 3,000 K (Supplementary Fig.\n2c\n)\n33\n, this could enable the synthesis of HT-SAs at an even higher temperature. As an example, we synthesized HT-SAs at 1,800 and 2,000 K (using a lower (half) loading of 0.005 µmol cm\n–2\n) and observed the stable single-atom dispersion proved by both STEM and EXAFS measurements (Fig.\n2c\nand Supplementary Fig.\n9\n).\nFig. 2: Thermal stability of the HT-SAs.\na\n, We evaluated the morphology of Pt HT-SAs on the CA-CNF substrate using in situ STEM from room temperature up to 1,273 K, which demonstrated the superior thermal stability.\nb\n,\nc\n, A higher-temperature shockwave synthesis at 2,000 K (loading of 0.005 µmol cm\n–2\n) also produced thermally stable HT-SAs (\nb\n), as shown by its corresponding EXAFS profiles (without phase correction) (\nc\n).\nd\n, Summary of the results of single-atom synthesis temperatures and time by our shockwave method and other techniques in the literature (square brackets)\n2\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n10\n,\n12\n,\n20\n. r.t., room temperature.\nFull size image\nFor comparison, in Fig.\n2d\nwe summarize previous reports of single atoms synthesized using various methods. Most wet chemical approaches use a mild temperature (<773 K) and the resulting single atoms are vulnerable under subsequent high-temperature annealing, especially when there is no proper bonding or coordination with the substrate\n17\n,\n19\n,\n27\n,\n28\n. Furnace heating or annealing at 1,073–1,173 K can substantially increase the thermal stability of single atoms by creating strong and stable metal–substrate bonding through atom trapping and substrate anchoring\n2\n,\n5\n,\n8\n,\n30\n. However, the much higher temperature of our shockwave method surpasses furnace heating with the ability to synthesize single atoms up to 1,500–2,000 K. In addition, a higher-temperature synthesis provides ultrafast kinetics for single-atom dispersion with extremely shorter processing durations (<10 s) and a higher efficiency compared to low-temperature methods.\nAnalysis of the single-atom bond structure\nThe thermal stability of HT-SAs comes from the Pt–substrate bond’s ability to resist high-temperature annealing. Experimentally, we analysed the bond structure by extracting the nearest-neighbour coordination numbers and the local structure of the Pt HT-SAs from fitting the EXAFS profiles with first-shell model (Table\n1\nand Supplementary Fig.\n10\n). Figure\n3a\nshows a typical EXAFS fitting of Pt 1,500 K HT-SAs, which renders a bond distance of 1.931 Å and a coordination number of 2.8 (indicating a Pt–X\n3\nbond configuration). The experimentally derived bond length is considerably shorter than the literature reported Pt–O (2.01–2.05 Å) (refs.\n10\n,\n34\n) and Pt–N bonds (~2.3 Å) (ref.\n35\n), but it is in good agreement with a Pt–C bond that has a calculated bond length of 1.93 Å (ref.\n36\n). Moreover, based on this Pt–X\n3\nbond model, we calculated the bond distance of Pt–C in Pt–C\n3\n, Pt–N in Pt–N\n3\nand Pt–O in Pt–O\n2\nC\n2\nusing density functional theory (DFT)\n37\n,\n38\n,\n39\n,\n40\n. The calculated Pt–C bond in the Pt–C\n3\nconfiguration shows a bond distance of 1.940 Å, which is very close to the experimentally fitted result, whereas the Pt–N and Pt–O bonds all have much larger bond distances (Fig.\n3b\n), which confirms the Pt–C bond structure in our samples.\nTable 1 Fitting parameters of the Fourier transform of the first shell of the EXAFS spectra\nFull size table\nFig. 3: HT-SA dispersion mechanism and temperature effect\na\n, The first-shell model EXAFS fitting of the Fourier transform (FT) at the Pt L\n3\nedge for the Pt 1,500 K 10 cycles sample shows a bond distance of 1.931 Å with a coordination number of 2.8.\nb\n, DFT-calculated bond distances in the Pt–C\n3\n, Pt–N\n3\nand Pt–O\n2\nC\n2\nconfigurations.\nc\n, MD simulation on the single-atom dispersion ((i)–(iii)) and subsequent annealing (iv) at 1,500 K.\nd\n, Identified Pt–Pt (type 1) and Pt–C bonds (types 2–10) in the dispersion system.\ne\n, The statistical distribution of bond configurations before (i) and after (iii) the shockwave synthesis at a high temperature in\nc\n—the weak bonds become strong Pt–C bonds.\nf\n, Energy analysis of a Pt atom deviated from a Pt-30 cluster by forming a thermodynamically stable Pt–C bond (type 10).\ng\n,\nh\n, Time needed for single-atom dispersion (\ng\n) and associated bond configuration at different synthesis temperatures (\nh\n).

CINEB, climbing image-nudged elastic band.\nFull size image\nThe DFT result also reveals that the bonding energy of Pt–C bonds is surprisingly higher than that of Pt–N bonds under the similar bond configurations (Pt–X\n3\nand Pt–X\n4\n) (Supplementary Fig.\n11a\n). In addition, the charge density difference diagrams further illustrate the difference between Pt–C and Pt–N bonds: in Pt–C bonds, a large amount of charge transfer appears between the Pt and C atoms and the charge density is mainly concentrated in the centre, which indicates a strong covalent bond nature; however, in Pt–N bonds, the transferred electron is mainly circulated around the Pt and N atoms, which denotes an ionic bond (Supplementary Fig.\n11b\n). Therefore, the Pt–C bonds demonstrate a higher binding energy and a unique covalent nature compared with Pt–N bonds in a similar bond configuration.\nHigh-temperature dispersion and stabilization\nTo understand the atomistic origin of the high-temperature-induced dispersion and stabilization, we performed molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using the reactive force field (ReaxFF) potential\n41\n,\n42\n(details in\nSupplementary Methods\n). The defects on graphene contain randomly etched carbon vacancies to mimic the surface of CA-CNFs. Figure\n3c\nclearly depicts the dispersion of Pt clusters into single atoms with increasing heating cycles at 1,500 K (from (i) to (iii)), as well as the dispersion stability on thermal annealing at 1,500 K (iv). We observed both the agglomeration and atomization of Pt atoms, but the atomization can only be stabilized when energy-favourable Pt–C bonds are formed (types 4–10 in Fig.\n3d\n). Figure\n3e\nshows the evolution of bond structures before and after a shockwave at 1,500 K, in which all the initial weak bonds (Pt–Pt cluster and types 1–3 Pt–C bonds) change into stronger Pt–C bonds (types 4–10) with higher binding energies, which illustrates the atomic origin as to why the HT-SAs are more thermally stable than Pt clusters. The simulation clearly reproduced our synthesis process in which the initial Pt clusters are weakly attached with the substrate, but with more shockwave heating, the clusters are disassembled into single atoms by forming thermodynamically stable Pt–C bonds that can sustain high-temperature annealing. This also indicates defects on the substrates are essential to stabilize HT-SAs and determine the dispersion density.\nIn the process, high temperature is critical to provide sufficient activation energy for atom diffusion and overcome the energy barrier for bond formation. As an example, when a single Pt atom deviates from a Pt-30 cluster to form a Pt–C bond, kinetically there is an energy barrier (for example, 1.48 eV) that hinders the dispersion, which can only be overcome at a high temperature (Fig.\n3f\nand Supplementary Fig.\n12\n). We also simulated the shockwave dispersion at other temperatures: 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 2,500 K (Supplementary Fig.\n13\n). Although similar shockwave patterns (on/off ratio and cycle numbers) were applied, low temperatures (500 and 1,000 K) failed to fully disperse the Pt cluster within the given repeated cycles. In contrast, higher shockwave temperatures had improved kinetics and achieved single-atom dispersion much faster, that is, gave a much higher dispersion efficiency (Fig.\n3g\n). Moreover, the Pt–C bond distribution in these HT-SAs shows an increasing proportion of more stable type 5–10 bonds at higher synthesis temperatures, which indicates an improved thermal stability (Fig.\n3h\n). Therefore, high-temperature synthesis is critical for single-atom dispersion and stabilization as it provides the essential activation energy to accelerate the dispersion process and promote the formation of bonds that are more stable.\nGenerality of the shockwave synthesis and catalytic study\nThe simple shockwave synthesis method can generally be applied to other metals and substrates in which a high temperature enables the atom dispersion by forming stable metal–defect bonds while the shockwave heating helps maintain the overall stability. As the shockwave temperature is sufficiently high compared with the thermal decomposition temperatures of most metal precursors, our method can be used to produce single-atom dispersions of most metals, as demonstrated of Ru and Co HT-SAs on CA-CNFs (Fig.\n4a\nand Supplementary Fig.\n14\n).\nFig. 4: The generality of the shockwave method and HT-SAs in catalytic reactions.\na\n, Co HT-SAs synthesized on CA-CNFs confirmed by the EXAFS profile and a HAADF image (inset).\nb\n,\nc\n, Pt HT-SAs synthesized on C\n3\nN\n4\n(\nb\n) and TiO\n2\n(\nc\n) substrates through radiative and conductive shockwave synthesis (~0.5 wt%).\nd\n,\ne\n, The light-off curves (\nd\n) and the Arrhenius plots (\ne\n) of the Pt HT-SAs for the CO oxidation reaction before and after steam treatment at 973 K for 4 h show a stable performance after hydrothermal treatment.\nf\n, The stable performance of the Pt HT-SAs during CO oxidation at 493 K for 50 h.\ng\n, High-temperature direct CH\n4\nconversion at 973 K by Pt HT-SAs for 50 h and Pt IMP samples for 20 h.\nh\n, The reaction TOF compared with the literature value for nanocluster Pt/SiO\n2\n(ref.\n43\n).\nFull size image\nIn addition, the shockwave method can be extended to other substrates, such as conductive reduced graphene oxide, semiconductor C\n3\nN\n4\nand oxides like TiO\n2\n, but with a different heating method (Supplementary Fig.\n15\n) and forming different bonds with the substrates (Supplementary Fig.\n16\n). Radiative shockwave heating can be used for powder samples by depositing precursor-loaded powders beneath a carbon film that was Joule heated in a shockwave pattern. The high temperature achieved in the film also heated the C\n3\nN\n4\npowder and induced a high-density single-atom dispersion (Fig.\n4b\n). In addition, the shockwave heating maintained the structural integrity of C\n3\nN\n4\n, which otherwise would be easily carbonized by prolonged heating (Supplementary Fig.\n17\n). The non-contact radiative heating can also be scaled up easily for a continuous production (Supplementary Fig.\n18\n). Alternatively, as oxides have a poor thermal conductivity for effectively radiative heating, we achieved Pt HT-SAs on TiO\n2\nsubstrates by depositing a thin layer (~2.5 nm) of TiO\n2\non the nanofibres in a CA-CNF film via atomic layer deposition (Supplementary Fig.\n15c\n). The shockwave heating of the CA-CNF film also heated the TiO\n2\nlayer through conductive heating and induced the single-atom dispersion on TiO\n2\n(Fig.\n4c\n). These results demonstrate the generality of the high-temperature-shockwave method for synthesizing thermally stable single-atom dispersions, which suggests a great potential for scalable nanomanufacturing.\nTo test the stability of our HT-SAs, we first performed an in situ hydrothermal test for Pt HT-SAs on CA-CNFs in an environmental TEM (ETEM) at a partial H\n2\nO pressure of 10\n−3\nmbar from 300 to 773 K (the upper limit is to avoid equipment corrosion), with each studied temperature held for at least 30 minutes. As shown in Supplementary Fig.\n19\n, no nanocluster emerged during the in situ measurement up to 773 K, which proves the HT-SAs are stable. We further confirmed the performance stability of the Pt HT-SAs in the CO oxidation reaction before and after hydrothermal treatment using 5% H\n2\nO at 973 K for four hours, which corroborates the hydrothermal stability of the Pt HT-SAs (Fig.\n4d\n). The Arrhenius plots measured by kinetic studies (Fig.\n4e\n) also show that the apparent reaction energies of the Pt single-atom catalysts before and after the steam pretreatment are very close (50.7 kJ mol\n–1\nversus 53.2 kJ mol\n–1\n). In addition, we performed multiple cycles of the CO oxidation measurements (Supplementary Fig.\n20\n), as well as a stability test at 493 K for 50 hours, and both confirmed the high stability of the Pt HT-SAs (Fig.\n4f\n).\nAdditionally, we demonstrated that the HT-SAs have a reductive catalytic application in direct methane conversion, in which single-atom catalysts exhibit good performances due to the coke resistance by preventing catalytic C–C coupling\n43\n,\n44\n. A control sample was synthesized via a conventional impregnation (that is, IMP) method by using the same material but thermally reducing it at 573 K for one hour (Supplementary Fig.\n21\n). Figure\n4g\nand Supplementary Fig.\n22\ndisplay the performance of Pt IMP and Pt HT-SAs for the direct CH\n4\nconversion at 973 K to give various products, such as ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butene and benzene among others. The product distribution shows a high selectivity for C\n2\nH\n4\n, C\n2\nH\n6\nand C\n6\nH\n6\n(>90%) for Pt HT-SAs and no coke formation for extended 50 h. In contrast, the Pt IMP sample shows severe coke formation even during the first hour of reaction, which could be ascribed to the continuous ensembles and aggregation of Pt sites at a high temperature (973 K). Figure\n4h\nshows the superior stability of the Pt HT-SAs in CH\n4\nconversion with a stable turnover frequency (TOF) for 50 h, in contrast to the quick drop of TOF for the Pt IMP sample due to its dispersion instability at a high temperature and aggregation into nanoclusters. Note that our HT-SAs demonstrate a roughly 1,000-times higher TOF than the Pt nanocluster supported on SiO\n2\ncatalysts reported in the literature under similar conditions\n43\n, which manifests the criticalness and great efficiency of single-atom catalysts. These practical results demonstrate the superior thermal stabilities of HT-SAs synthesized by high-temperature shockwaves and their great potential for catalytic applications.\nConclusion\nWe report a high-temperature-shockwave method to synthesize and stabilize high-density single atoms at very high temperatures with a great efficiency. The shockwave design enables a high-temperature (1,500–2,000 K) synthesis during the on state; however, the average temperature is significantly lower (for example, 400 K) as a result of the extended off times, which makes the method compatible with various substrates and manufacturing. Control experiments and simulation results revealed the critical roles of high-temperature synthesis, which provides the activation energy and ultrafast kinetics for single-atom dispersion and promotes a more-stable bond formation with the defects on the substrates. We confirmed the high-temperature stability of the HT-SAs by in situ (stable up to 1,273 K) and ex situ STEM (shockwave stability up to 1,500–2,000 K). We also demonstrated the stability of HT-SAs in CO oxidation and in direct methane conversion over 50 hours. The shockwave method is facile and general for synthesizing various thermally stable single atoms on different substrates, which provides a route for single-atom manufacturing to give high-temperature catalytic reactions.\nMethods\nMaterials and substrates\nAll the salt precursors, H\n2\nPtCl\n6\nhydrate (99.995%), RuCl\n3\n·\nx\nH\n2\nO (>98%) and CoCl\n2\n·6H\n2\nO (98%), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification. CNF substrates were derived from polyacrylonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) by electrospinning an 8 wt% polyacrylonitrile in dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich) solution at a voltage of 15–20 kV, a spinning distance of 10 cm and a feed rate of 1 ml h\n–1\n. The nanofibre mat was first stabilized in air at 533 K for 5 h and carbonized at 1,273 K for 2 h in Ar to create the CNF sample. The CNF material was then thermally annealed under a CO\n2\natmosphere (80 ml min\n–1\n) at 1,023 K for 3 h (CA-CNF). Reduced graphene oxide was synthesized according to a modified Hummer’s method\n45\nand then thermally reduced at 300 °C for 2 h in an Ar-protected tube furnace. The C\n3\nN\n4\npowder substrate was synthesized by pyrolysis of melamine powder at 550 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. The TiO\n2\n-coated CA-CNFs were fabricated using atomic layer deposition (Beneq TFS 500 ALD) of alternating a Ti precursor and H\n2\nO for 50 cycles (estimated TiO\n2\nthickness of 2.5 nm).\nShockwave synthesis\nThe salt precursors were dissolved in ethanol-based solutions at a dilute concentration (0.0001–0.0005 mol l\n–1\n), and the solutions were directly dropped onto the suspended CNF films with a loading of 20–100 μLcm\n–2\n(in total ~0.01 μmol cm\n–2\n) and left to dry (room temperature, 30 min). The precursor-loaded CNF films were then subjected to the shockwave synthesis in an Ar-filled glovebox using a programmable electrical pulse (Keithley 2425). The pulse temperature, duration and on–off ratio were easily adjusted by the programming in the Keithley 2425 system (the sweep function) or by an external control software. A high-power d.c. source (Volteq, 1,200 W) was also used when a high input power was needed. The programmable pulse heating o the high-power electric source was controlled by Keithely through a relay.\nTo estimate the temperature evolution during the shockwave process, a homemade colour ratio pyrometer measurement was performed using a Vision Research Phantom Miro M110 high-speed camera. Detailed temperature calculations are given in a previous paper\n46\n. MATLAB was used to extract the raw pixel values to calculate the temperatures. For the figures that show the temperature of a single sample as a function of time, only unsaturated pixels above the black level and within the error threshold were used to report the mean and median temperature of the frame for a contiguous area of at least ten acceptable pixels."

Then, 50 mg of the synthesized g-C\n3\nN\n4\nwas dispersed in a 20 ml gas-tight vial with 10 ml of 20% methanol aqueous solution. Chloroplatinic acid with an equivalent amount of 4 wt% Pt regarding g-C\n3\nN\n4\nwas added to the reaction solution.

After vigorous stirring, PPG was added to the HPU solution with a volume ratio of 1:2 (PPG:HPU). A mixed sol–gel state was obtained after the addition of PPG, and the gel phase was separated after 24 h. After moulding the gel into a circular shape with a diameter of 6 cm, EtOH and water in the gel phase were removed by drying at 60 °C for two days, and the gel phase was reswollen in water to remove NaCl granules in the HPU–PPG elastomer–hydrogel nanocomposite.

The fabrication of a supporting layer follows the same procedures, except starting with 16 ml HPU solution (HPU in water, 50 wt%) and skipping the addition of photocatalysts. The bilayer system of the nanocomposite was fabricated by integrating the photocatalytic layer and supporting layer with the aid of EtOH. EtOH was added dropwise on the top surface of the supporting layer, and the photocatalytic layer was attached to the supporting layer. The bilayer system was dried at 60 °C for 24 h to remove EtOH and reswollen in water.\nFabrication of PAM nanocomposites\nThe acrylamide/bis-acrylamide solution (19:1) was added to the as-prepared acrylamide solution (0.156 g ml\n–1\n).

First, 1 mmol Mo source (176 mg, (NH\n4\n)\n6\nMo\n7\nO\n24\n·4H\n2\nO), a certain amount of metal salts (Mn(CH\n3\nCOO)\n2\n·4H\n2\nO, Fe(CH\n3\nCOO)\n2\n·4H\n2\nO, Co(CH\n3\nCOO)\n2\n·4H\n2\nO and Ni(CH\n3\nCOO)\n2\n·4H\n2\nO) and 750 mg CH\n3\nCSNH\n2\n(10.0 mmol) were dissolved in 70 ml distilled water. The solution containing precursors was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 ml). Subsequently, it was sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 20 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The resulting product was washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. Under an Ar flow of 100 sccm, the dried product was heated to 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C min\n−1\nand kept there for 2 hours in a furnace, and then cooled to room temperature. A series of M\n1\n/MoS\n2\nSASCs can be obtained using this approach by tuning the contents and types of metal salt precursors (\nn\nM\n/\nn\nMo max\n= 20 at.%).\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe OER measurements including cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry polarization curves were performed using a CHI 760D workstation (CH Instruments) with a counter electrode of a graphite rod (diameter, 5 mm; 99.999%) and a reference electrode of Hg/Hg\n2\nCl\n2\n(saturated KCl). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100,000 Hz. All the potentials were calibrated against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), where\nE\nRHE\n=\nE\nref\n+ 0.059pH + 0.241.\nE\nref\nis the experimental potential measured against the Hg/Hg\n2\nCl\n2\nreference electrode, and 0.241 is the standard potential of Hg/Hg\n2\nCl\n2\nat 25 °C (refs.\n47\n,\n48\n).\nElectrode fabrication\nA piece of copper (Cu) foam was sonicated in acetone, ethanol and distilled water for several minutes, prior to the preparation of the electrode. Some 15 mg MoS\n2\n-based catalyst was added into a mixture of 0.90 ml ethanol and 100 μl Nafion (Dupont, 5 wt%) with 1 h ultrasonic treatment. Some 100 μl fresh catalyst ink was dropped onto a piece of Cu foam (0.5 cm × 2 cm; the surface area of the catalyst deposited on the electrode is 0.5 cm\n2\n) and dried at room temperature for 12 h. All tests were performed in 1.0 M KOH solution saturated with oxygen gas (O\n2\n). For a comparison, 10 mg IrO\n2\ncatalyst was added into a mixture of 0.90 ml ethanol and 100 μl Nafion with 1 h ultrasonic treatment. Some 100 μl of fresh catalyst ink was dropped onto a piece of Cu foam, and the loading of IrO\n2\non the Cu foam was 1 mg cm\n−2\n. The samples were run for ten cycles to reach a steady state. The linear scan voltammetry measurements for the MoS\n2\nand IrO\n2\ncatalysts were recorded in O\n2\n-saturated electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV s\n−1\n. Cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded from 0.37 to 0.57 V versus RHE with a scan rate of 10 mV s\n−1\nto 120 mV s\n−1\nto measure the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (\nC\ndl\n). The long-term stability was measured by chronoamperometric response under magnetic stirring. OER performances under different magnetic fields were performed by tuning the distances between the electrode and magnets. Seawater was collected from Sentosa beach (Singapore), and filtrated by filter paper.\nThe Cu foil loaded with the catalyst (0.2 mg cm\n−2\n) acted as the work electrode (anode), and the Pt wire was the cathode. Ten neodymium magnets (one magnet, 3 cm × 2 cm × 0.5 cm) were stacked and placed near the anode of the water splitting cell. The magnetic field experienced by the electrode was carefully calibrated using a Gauss meter (TD8620, Shenzhen; Supplementary Fig.\n53\n). A large water splitting cell was constructed using two 6 cm × 10 cm carbon papers loaded with Ni\n1\n/MoS\n2\n(3 mg cm\n−2\n, 6 cm × 7 cm) and Pt/C (20 wt% Pt, 3 mg cm\n−2\n, 6 cm × 7 cm) as the anode and cathode, respectively. One hundred neodymium magnets (3 cm × 2 cm × 0.5 cm) were compiled into a large magnet and placed near the anode.\nDFT calculations\nThe first-principles calculations were performed by using DFT implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package\n49\n,\n50\n,\n51\n. The electron exchange and correction were calculated with the generalized gradient approximation in the parametrization of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof\n52\npseudopotentials including Coulomb repulsion term U in the Hubbard Hamiltonian (DFT +\nU\nformalism) based on Dudarev’s approach\n53\n. The projector augmented-wave method with a plane-wave cut-off of 500 eV was used. The electronic states of 4\nd\n5\n5\ns\n1\n, 3\ns\n2\n3\np\n4\n, 3\np\n6\n3\nd\n8\n4\ns\n2\n, 2\np\n2\n2\np\n4\nand 1\ns\n1\nwere treated as valence states for Mo, S, Ni, O and H atoms, respectively. According to the experimental Ni loading concentration, the 4 × 4 × 1 supercell of MoS\n2\nwith one Mo atom replaced by a Ni atom was used to simulate the doping effect. A vacuum slab of 16 Å was added to avoid the interlayer interaction. The structures were relaxed with a 2 × 2 × 1 gamma-centred k-point mesh for the supercell, and the electronic self-consistent calculations were performed using the 5 × 5 × 1 k-point mesh. The relaxation was considered to be converged if the Hellmann–Feynman force was less than 0.01 eV Å\n–1\n, and the energy convergence was set as 10\n−7\neV for all calculations with a Gaussian smearing of 0.05 eV. The gas-phase O\n2\nand H\n2\nO were performed in a cubic box with a lattice constant of 15 Å using a single gamma k point. To consider the strong electron correlation effect, a\nU\neff\n= 2.5 eV was assigned to 3\nd\nelectrons for Ni atoms\n54\n,\n55\n.\nThe charge transfer was analysed by the Bader charge with a grid of 384 × 384 × 480 (ref.\n56\n). The differential electron density was also implemented to analyse the charge transfers during the adsorption process. The differential electron density was attained by the formula\n$$\\Delta {\\rm{\\rho }}={\\rho }_{{\\mathrm{AB}}}-{\\rho }_{{\\mathrm{A}}}-{\\rho }_{{\\mathrm{B}}}$$\nwhere\nρ\nAB\nrepresents the charge density of the whole system after absorption, and\nρ\nA\nand\nρ\nB\nrepresent the charge densities of the adsorbed species and catalyst, respectively."

This route requires multiple elementary reaction steps, including dissociative CO activation to form alkyl species (CH\nx\n*, where * denotes surface species), subsequent C–C coupling of CH\nx\n* to grow carbon chains, nondissociative CO insertion and stepwise hydrogenations\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n, leading to a broad product distribution, where complex oxygenate mixtures of various alcohols, aldehydes, esters and acids are generally produced. Owing to small differences in their boiling temperatures\n2\n,\n4\n,\n5\n, subsequent product separation and purification can be highly energy demanding. The delicate control of the above competing elementary reactions to exclusively produce a specific C\n2+\noxygenate, especially at high CO conversions, is highly desirable for practical applications but remains extremely challenging.\nEthanol (EtOH) is an essential commodity chemical with a global demand of 100 billion gallons annually\n2\n,\n4\n,\n6\n. Direct conversion of syngas to EtOH requires only one step of C–C coupling, thus holding great potential for high selectivity.

Alkali-promoted Mo-based catalysts have also been explored\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\nand achieved a markable EtOH selectivity of ~60% in oxygenates at a CO conversion of ~8% (ref.\n15\n). In comparison, Rh catalysts with alkali promoters and/or Rh-M(O\nx\n) (M = Mn, Fe, Zr and Ce) interfaces were found to be more favourable for EtOH synthesis\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n17\n,\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n,\n24\n,\n25\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n,\n29\n. Unfortunately, high EtOH selectivity (>80%) has generally been achieved at low conversions (<5%) even with multiple promoters involved\n2\n,\n4\n(Supplementary Table\n2\n). Tandem catalysis using multiple catalysts is another effective approach for achieving high selectivity\n5\n,\n30\n,\n31\n,\n32\n. For instance, Wang et al.\n5\nreported a remarkably high EtOH selectivity of 95% in oxygenates at a CO conversion of 5.7% over tri-component tandem catalysts of K\n+\n-modified ZnO−ZrO\n2\n, H-MOR zeolite and Pt−Sn/SiC\n5\n. Consequently, there is an urgent need to overcome the severe activity–selectivity trade-off\n3\n,\n17\n, thus largely promoting the productivity of a specific C\n2+\nalcohol with high selectivity.\nIn this Article, we report that the precise assembly of Rh-ZrO\n2\nand Rh-FeO\nx\ninterfaces in atomic-scale proximity on tetragonal zirconia (\nt\n-ZrO\n2\n) enables efficient tandem conversion of syngas to EtOH. The resulting dual-interface catalyst broke the activity–selectivity trade-off and achieved a high EtOH selectivity of up to 90% in oxygenates at an appreciable CO conversion of 51% as well as a high EtOH space-time yield (STY) of 668.2 mg g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n, greatly outperforming those reported in the literature.

Subsequently, 12 ml of 1.0 M HCl solution, which contains 3.0 g of ammonium peroxydisulfate, that is, (NH\n4\n)\n2\nS\n2\nO\n8\n, was added dropwise into the above mixed solution with vigorous stirring. After polymerization in an ice bath for nearly one day, the mixture was dried using a rotary evaporator. Then, the dried powder was annealed under Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. Finally, the product was treated by alkaline (2.0 M NaOH) and acid (2.0 M H\n2\nSO\n4\n) leaching successively to remove SiO\n2\nnanoparticles templates and unstable Co-based species, respectively, to obtain the Co-SAC. We used the same method to prepare Ni-SAC. The only difference is that 0.405 g NiCl\n2\n·6H\n2\nO and 1.0 g SiO\n2\nwere used to synthesize Ni-SAC. Fe-SAC was obtained on the basis of our previous paper.\nSynthesis of OCB catalysts\nOCB is synthesized on the basis of our previously reported method\n7\n,\n45\n. 2 g of commercially available XC-72 carbon (Vulcan XC-72, Fuel Cell Store) was added into a three-neck flask with 460 ml 70% HNO\n3\nsolution and 140 ml deionized water. The mixture was well stirred and refluxed at 80 °C for 24 h. The resulting slurry was washed with water and ethanol after natural cooling until the solution pH reached neutral, and the precipitate obtained was dried overnight at 80 °C in an oven.\nPreparation of electrode\nFor preparation of cathode electrode, typically, 40 mg of as-prepared catalysts, 4 ml of 2-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 160 µl of Nafion binder solution (Sigma, 5%) were mixed together to form a catalyst ink with around 10.0 mg ml\n−1\n. The ink was sonicated for about 30 min to obtain a homogeneous ink and then spray coated onto the 5 × 5 cm\n2\nSigracet 28 BC gas-diffusion layer (GDL; Fuel Cell Store) electrodes. The Pt/C (Fuel Cell Store) used in this work followed the same procedure to prepare the cathode electrode. The IrO\n2\nelectrode purchased from Dioxide Materials was used for the anode electrode during the electrochemical process.\nElectrochemical CO\n2\ncapture\nElectrochemical measurements were all conducted using a BioLogic VMP3 workstation. The PSE reactor used respective catalysts Pt/C, Co-SAC, loaded on 1.0 cm\n2\nGDL as the cathode electrode. This geometric area of the electrodes was fixed unless otherwise noted. A 0.015-inch-thick polytetrafluoroethylene gasket with 1.0 cm\n2\nwindow and Sustainion AEM membrane was placed between the cathode electrode and the solid-electrolyte layer. The middle-layer solid-electrolyte compartment comprises 2.5 mm Delrin plastic (1.5 mm for thinner middle-layer plate) and is packed with Dowex 50W X8 hydrogen-form solid electrolyte to ensure ionic conductivity. Nafion 117 film (Fuel Cell Store) with a second polytetrafluoroethylene gasket was placed on the anode and IrO\n2\n(Dioxide Materials) was used as the anode for the OER. For the standard tests, the cathode was supplied with humidified CO\n2\n(Airgas, 99.999%) and 200 standard cubic centimetres per minute (sccm) O\n2\n(Airgas, 99.999%) or air (Airgas, zero grade) mixtures by precisely tuning the gas flow rates using digital mass flow controllers (Alicat), followed by a concentration calibration (13.9%, 8.6% and 4.6% CO\n2\n) using a CO\n2\nmeter (CO2Meter) for all tests. For the poisoning-effect test, further toxic gas, including CO (Airgas, 99.999%), SO\n2\n(Airgas, 1,800 ppm balanced with N\n2\n) or NO (Airgas, 5,000 ppm balanced with N\n2\n), was injected and diluted to the required concentration with a fixed 13.9% CO\n2\nconcentration. To avoid insufficient CO\n2\nsupply impeding the evaluation of the intrinsic performance, the input gas mixture flow rate was adjusted to guarantee more than 80% CO\n2\nleft over in the tail gas (less than 20% crossover). Therefore, for the 6,200 ppm and 2,950 ppm CO\n2\ntests, the flow rate of inlet O\n2\nwas increased to 300 sccm to minimize the FE measurement error associated with CO\n2\nstream flow rate change. For direct air-capture tests, we used 400 ppm CO\n2\n(Airgas) as the input source and increased the total air gas flow to 1,000 sccm to ensure sufficient CO\n2\n. At the same time, we also used a 6-cm\n2\nelectrode to increase the total carbon-capture current for minimized measurement errors in carbon-capture rates. For the flue gas capture, a simulated flue gas (13.9% CO\n2\n, 7.8% O\n2\n, 76.3% N\n2\nand 2.0% H\n2\nO) was prepared as the gas input to a tandem reactor system. The O\n2\ngenerated from the first reactor was further recycled to increase the O\n2\nconcentration during the capture process. All gas flow rates were precisely controlled by the mass flow controller (Alicat) and the concentration of the mixture was measured and recorded by a CO\n2\nmeter (CO2Meter). The middle solid-electrolyte layer was continuously flowed with 1.1 ml min\n−1\n(0.5 ml min\n−1\nfor DAC and low-current-density tests) of deionized water to bring out dissolved CO\n2\nand CO\n2\ngas, and the anode side was circulated with 2.0 ml min\n−1\nof deionized water or 0.1 M H\n2\nSO\n4\n(>300 mA cm\n−2\n). For the long-term stability test, the anolyte was replaced with 2.0 ml min\n−1\nof deionized water, while everything else was conducted with the same parameters.\nAll cell resistance was measured by potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and all the whole-cell voltage was reported without any\niR\ncompensation except for Supplementary Fig.\n4\n.\nMiddle-layer gas and liquid analysis\nWater-displacement measurement was used to measure the gaseous CO\n2\nflow rate (Supplementary Fig.\n7\n). CO\n2\n-saturated 0.01 M H\n2\nSO\n4\nwas used during the water-displacement measurement to measure the CO\n2\nbubble flow rate. It was pre-saturated with CO\n2\nto minimize the gas dissolution and the acid was used to further suppress the CO\n2\ngas solubility during the bubble flow rate measuring process. This water displacement showed high measurement accuracy.\nTo avoid introducing any CO\n2\ncontamination from external sources into our PSE layer, the deionized water flow we used to push out the captured CO\n2\ngas was pre-saturated with Ar but not CO\n2\n. As a result, a fraction of captured CO\n2\nwill be dissolved into our deionized water stream, which needs to be titrated (Supplementary Figs.\n5\nand\n6\n). In practical carbon-capture applications, we can always recycle the deionized water flow so that captured CO\n2\nwill be continuously pushed out in its gas phase after the stream is saturated. The middle-layer output stream containing dissolved CO\n2\nwas collected directly in 200–500 µl of 1 M NaOH. By collecting it into the alkaline solution, the loss of dissolved CO\n2\nto air was minimized and a full range of titration could be conducted. 4 ml of this collected liquid was then titrated using 0.1 M HCl and pH meter (Orion Star A111). The volume difference between two equivalence points on the titration curve determines how many moles of carbonate species exist inside the liquid samples. The dissolved carbon dioxide concentration was then calculated as:\n$${Q}_{1}=\\frac{\\Delta V\\times {C}_{1}\\times 24.4\\,({\\rm{l}}\\,{{\\rm{m}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{l}}}^{-1})}{V}\\times q$$\nin which\nQ\n1\nis the CO\n2\nflow rate equivalent to dissolved carbon concentration, Δ\nV\nis the volume of HCl between two equivalence points on the titration curve,\nC\n1\nis the concentration of the HCl solution used, 24.4 (l mol\n−1\n) is the molar volume of an ideal gas at 1 atmosphere of pressure and room temperature,\nV\nis the volume of the sample titrated (minus the added alkaline volume) and\nq\nis the flow rate of the collected liquid output.\nThe partial current density for a given gas product was calculated as:\n$${j}_{i}=\\frac{{Q}_{1}+{Q}_{2}}{24.4\\,({\\rm{l}}\\,{{\\rm{m}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{l}}}^{-1})}\\times {n}_{i}F\\times {({\\rm{e}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{d}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{a}})}^{-1}$$\nin which\nQ\n1\nand\nQ\n2\nis the volumetric flow rate of liquid and gaseous CO\n2\ndetermined by titration and water-displacement methods, respectively,\nn\ni\nis the number of electrons involved, which is 2 for FE\ncarbonate\n, and\nF\nis the Faradaic constant."

In the representative synthesis of the\n0.17Rh@MEL\n, a gel solution was prepared by dissolving 0.030 g of KOH (0.5 mmol) in 2.32 ml of deionized H\n2\nO and then mixing with 3.880 g of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (6.0 mmol) and 4.120 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (19.8 mmol). A metal precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.0045 g of Rh(III) chloride hydrate (0.017 mmol) and 100 μl of ethylenediamine in 100 μl of deionized H\n2\nO. This metal precursor was added dropwise into the gel solution with vigorous stirring. The gel solution was then hydrolysed at 30 °C for 10 h with stirring (500 r.p.m.). The molar composition of the obtained gel was 66.7 (K\n2\nO):5,282.6 (SiO\n2\n):1,600.8 (TBAOH): 6,8921.1 (H\n2\nO):4.0 (Rh):400.2 (NH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nNH\n2\n). The resultant yellow solution was transferred into a 50-ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 130 °C for 24 h under static conditions. Following the hydrothermal crystallization, the solid product was isolated by centrifugation and sequentially washed with deionized water and ethanol. Subsequently, it was dried at 80 °C for 12 h in ambient air. The obtained solid sample was further calcined in static air at 560 °C for 5 h and then reduced under a flow of H\n2\n/Ar mixture at 600 °C for 2 h. The as-prepared sample was denoted\n0.17Rh@MEL\n.\nSynthesis of Rh\nOD\n@MEL materials\nA CO pretreatment was subsequently conducted to disrupt Rh clusters into isolated atoms and thus generate the atomically dispersed Rh sites on the original\n0.17Rh@MEL\nsample. For details, the\n0.17Rh@MEL\nsample was loaded into quartz tubes and subjected to heating under a continuous flow of CO (0.5 MPa) at 90 °C for 2 h. The Rh loading in the resulting\n0.17Rh\nOD\n@MEL\nsamples was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis. The syntheses of\n0.05Rh\nOD\n@MEL\nand\n0.33Rh\nOD\n@MEL\nwere succeeded under identical conditions, except using different amounts of Rh(III) chloride hydrate (0.0012 g and 0.0092 g, respectively) within the previously mentioned synthesis procedure.\nMaterial"

                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41586-024-08483-w, Methods\nSynthesis of γ-Mo\n2\nN\nγ-Mo\n2\nN was synthesized using a temperature-programmed nitridation technique. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH\n4\n)\n6\nMo\n7\nO\n24\n·4H\n2\nO) powder (10 g) was calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 10 h to synthesize MoO\n3\n. Subsequently, 2 g of untreated MoO\n3\npowder was nitridated in pure ammonia flow (200 ml min\n−1\n) by the following temperature-programmed procedure: heated from room temperature to 350 °C at a rate of 10 °C min\n−1\n, then to 450 °C at 0.5 °C min\n−1\nand finally to 785 °C at 2 °C min\n−1\n. The sample was held at 785 °C for an additional 4 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subjected to passivation using 0.5% O\n2\n/Ar (60 ml min\n−1\n) as the passivation gas overnight to yield the γ-Mo\n2\nN powder.\nSynthesis of La and other metal modified γ-Mo\n2\nNs\nLa\n2\nO\n3\n(45.3 mg, 2 wt% La) or an adequate amount of other metal oxides or metal salts (Y\n2\nO\n3\n, Pr\n2\nO\n3\n, Ho\n2\nO\n3\n, CsNO\n3\n, Ca(NO\n3\n)\n2\nand Sr(NO\n3\n)\n2\n) and 2 g MoO\n3\npowders were mechanically mixed and calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 10 h to obtain the La\n2\nO\n3\n(or other metal oxides)-loaded MoO\n3\nprecursor, which was subsequently subjected to nitridation using the same temperature-programmed nitridation method as for γ-Mo\n2\nN.\nSynthesis of α-MoC\nα-MoC was synthesized through a two-step temperature-programmed nitridation–carburization approach. Initially, 1 g of MoO\n3\npowder was heated in pure ammonia (160 ml min\n−1\n) from room temperature to 700 °C at a rate of 5 °C min\n−1\nand maintained at 700 °C for 2 h. After the nitridation process, the sample was cooled down to room temperature, then heated in 20% CH\n4\n/80% H\n2\n(160 ml min\n−1\n) to 700 °C at 5 °C min\n−1\nand held at 700 °C for 2 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subsequently subjected to passivation using 0.5% O\n2\n/Ar as the passivation gas overnight to obtain the α-MoC powder.\nSynthesis of Pt/γ-Mo\n2\nN, Pt/M-Mo\n2\nN and Pt/α-MoC\nA total of 400 mg of passivated γ-Mo\n2\nN (or M-Mo\n2\nN, α-MoC, where M = La, Pr, Y, Ho, Cs, Ca, Sr) powder was introduced into 15 ml of H\n2\nPtCl\n6\nsolution of appropriate concentration and stirred in pure argon atmosphere for 1 h. The suspension was subsequently evaporated at 30–35 °C to yield the corresponding Pt/γ-Mo\n2\nN (or Pt/M-Mo\n2\nN, Pt/α-MoC) catalyst. The Pt/γ-Mo\n2\nN and Pt/M-Mo\n2\nN catalysts were reduced at 350 °C for 2 h under 10% H\n2\n/90% Ar, and the Pt/α-MoC catalysts were reduced at 590 °C for 2 h under 15% CH\n4\n/85% H\n2\nbefore catalytic evaluation or characterizations.\nSynthesis of Pt/SiO\n2\ncatalyst\nThe reference Pt/SiO\n2\ncatalyst was synthesized using the wetness impregnation method. H\n2\nPtCl\n6\nsolution (800 µl) of appropriate concentration was added to 1 g of hydrophilic SiO\n2\npowder. The mixture was stirred until dry and further dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 2 h under 10% H\n2\n/90% Ar before catalytic evaluation or characterizations.\nElemental analysis of catalysts\nInductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy was used to determine the concentrations of metal elements in the sample series using a Prodigy 7 instrument. Before analysis, the samples were dissolved in aqua regia and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature.\nX-ray diffraction\nX-ray diffraction patterns were acquired on a PANalytical Powder X-ray diffractometer using a Cu-Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 40 mA. Before analysis, the samples were subjected to passivation to ensure stability under ambient conditions.\nNitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms\nAnalyses were performed at −196 °C using an ASAP 2020 Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry System. The samples were pretreated under a dynamic vacuum for 12 h to eliminate guest molecules and adsorbed moisture. Passivation was performed before analysis to maintain stability in an air atmosphere.\nScanning transmission electron microscopy\nScanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization was conducted on an aberration-corrected Nion HERMES-100 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV with a convergence semi-angle of 32 mrad. The collection semi-angles for STEM-HAADF imaging and EELS chemical mapping were 75–210 mrad and 0–75 mrad, respectively. The energy dispersion of EELS was set to 0.39 eV per channel or 0.89 eV per channel. As the low-dispersion settings have an inevitable nonlinearity of the energy dispersion at the two ends of the spectrometer prism, the onsets of the La L\n3\nedges were shifted to 832 eV to correct the slight offsets of the absolute energy-loss values. The EELS spectra shown in Fig.\n1\nand Supplementary Figs.\n12\nand\n13\nwere normalized by integrating the signals within the energy-loss range of 800–820 eV. The EELS analyses of other elements were carried out in the same manner with La. The catalyst samples were embedded in resin and sectioned into approximately 30 nm slices using ultramicrotomy for STEM-EELS characterization. Moreover, a subset of STEM-HAADF images, EELS spectra and EDS spectra were obtained using aberration-corrected FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 and JEOL GrandARM2 microscopes operating at 300 kV and 200 kV with the convergence semi-angles of 25 mrad and 32 mrad, respectively. For STEM-EDS analysis, the samples were prepared by depositing ethanol-sample suspensions onto grids coated with holey carbon film.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\nQuasi-in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of various catalysts were measured on an Axis Supra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical) using a monochromatized Al Kα radiation source. After activation or reaction, all catalysts were transferred to the measurement chamber without exposure to air. XPS with tunable photon energy for Pt/γ-Mo\n2\nN and Pt/La-Mo\n2\nN catalysts were acquired at beamline BL02B01 at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The activated samples were transferred to the chamber under the protection of Ar in a glove bag. For XPS measurements at SSRF, the typical X-ray spot size is about 120 μm (H) × 15 μm (V) and the incident angle is 15°, giving an elongated X-ray beam projection of around 460 μm (H) × 15 μm (V) on the sample. All these XPS spectra were processed using CasaXPS software.\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy\nPt L\n3\n-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra were measured at the beamline 1W1B of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility, which operates at 2.5 GeV with a current of 250 mA, and beamline BL14W1 SSRF, which operates at 3.5 GeV with a current of 350 mA. An Si(111) double crystal monochromator was used. The data were acquired in fluorescence mode using Lytle or a 19-element Ge solid-state detector as detectors. The samples were sealed in Kapton films under an argon atmosphere following activation and transferred to a glove box without air exposure. The XAS data were processed and analysed using the Demeter software package\n36\n.\nRaman spectroscopy\nRaman experiments were performed on a Horiba JY HR800 Raman spectrometer, whereas in situ and quasi-in-situ experiments were conducted using a Horiba LabRAM HR Raman spectrometer. The excitation laser wavelength was 532 nm.\nAfter a 36-h methanol-reforming reaction (150 mg catalysts, 200 °C, 5 bar, methanol/H\n2\nO = 1/3 (mol), weight-hourly space velocity of MeOH (WHSV\nMeOH\n) = 12.87 h\n−1\n), an accelerated-deactivation experiment (water treatment experiment) by feeding pure water vapour (200 °C, WHSV\nwater\n= 21.72 h\n−1\n, 350 kPa) into the reactor containing 1Pt/α-MoC, 1Pt/γ-Mo\n2\nN or 1Pt/2La-Mo\n2\nN catalyst for 12 h. The catalysts at fresh state (state i), and those after 36-h methanol-reforming reaction (state ii) and then the 12-h water treatment (state iii) were transferred into a Raman chamber without air exposure (by a glove box) for measurement (Fig.\n3b\n).\nFor in situ experiments (results shown in Supplementary Fig.\n31\n), the samples were reduced in a Raman chamber first in 10% H\n2\n/90% Ar at 350 °C for 2 h, then cooled down to room temperature. After heating to 200 °C in Ar with a heating rate of 10 °C min\n−1\n, the methanol–water vapour mixture was introduced into the chamber and the Raman spectra were measured at the same time. The products were simultaneously analysed with Agilent 990 Micro Gas Chromatography (Supplementary Fig.\n31\n).\nTemperature-programmed surface reaction and temperature-programmed desorption experiments\nThe desorption behaviours of methanol on the catalysts were examined by the temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectroscopy technique. Before the reaction, γ-Mo\n2\nN, Pt/γ-Mo\n2\nN and Pt/SiO\n2\ncatalysts were reduced in 10% H\n2\n/90% Ar at 350 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min\n−1\n. Then the system was purged by Ar flow (30 ml min\n−1\n). After that, saturated methanol vapour was introduced into the system from a bubbler that was maintained at 30 °C by 30 ml min\n−1\nAr flow until saturation adsorption. Then, the system was further purged by Ar flow until no signal of physisorbed methanol (\nm\n/\nz\n= 31) could be detected. Signals for H\n2\n(\nm\n/\nz\n= 2), CH\n4\n(\nm\n/\nz\n= 16), H\n2\nO (\nm\n/\nz\n= 18), CO (\nm\n/\nz\n= 28), CH\n3\nOH (\nm\n/\nz\n= 31), Ar (\nm\n/\nz\n= 40) and CO\n2\n(\nm\n/\nz\n= 44) were recorded using a Pfeiffer Vacuum OMNIstar mass spectrometer.\nThe methanol–water temperature-programmed surface reaction experiments use a similar experimental procedure as CH\n3\nOH temperature-programmed desorption, except for the adsorption stage. The water-to-methanol molar ratio in the liquid phase was maintained at 5:1 to ensure that the partial pressure of water was slightly higher than that of methanol in the gas phase at 30 °C.\nTransient kinetic analysis\nWater TKA experiments were conducted using α-MoC, γ-Mo\n2\nN and 2M-Mo\n2\nN (M = La, Pr, Cs, and Sr) catalysts at 100 °C. TKA setup is equipped with a dual-channel tube furnace with a reactor tube and a bypassing tube, and an online mass spectrometer system\n9\n. A four-way valve with an air actuator allowed for the switching of reaction gases between the reaction tube and the bypass tube. The reactor tube was loaded with 20 mg of passivated catalyst, whereas the bypass tube was not. After reduction, the TKA experimental procedures were started. First, 10 ml min\n−1\nAr was switched into the reactor to protect the catalyst, then 10 ml min\n−1\nreactant gas mixture (H\n2\nO:Ne:Ar = 1:4:75) was prepared in flow-controlled manifolds and detected by the mass spectrometer until the signals were stabilized. The water was introduced into the system by 2 ml min\n−1\nAr passing through the water bath at 303 K. Second, after the signals of reactant gas stabilized, the downstream four-way valve was switched, and the outflow from the reactor tube was detected by the mass spectrometer. Third, a switch from 10 ml min\n−1\nAr to 10 ml min\n−1\nH\n2\nO:Ne:Ar = 1:4:75 was performed quickly without any pressure fluctuation, and the transient signals were recorded by an online mass spectrometer. Finally, after 20 min, the 10 ml min\n−1\nreactant gas was switched back to 10 ml min\n−1\nAr. Until the signals stabilized, the water TKA experiments were repeated (Fig.\n3d\n).\nIn the experiments, when the fresh catalyst initially contacts with water, it undergoes both reversible and irreversible adsorption processes. For the irreversible adsorption part, a fraction of the water molecules dissociate, producing hydrogen in the effluent, and hydroxyls on the surface of the catalyst\n37\n. In the subsequent second water TKA experiment, as the catalyst interacts with water for the second instance, merely reversible adsorption happens, and no obvious production of hydrogen is observed. By subtracting the water signal (\nm\n/\nz\n= 18) of the first round of TKA experiments from that of the second TKA experiment, the amount of irreversible water adsorption under this specific reaction condition can be obtained (Fig.\n3e\n). By calibrating the signal of H\n2\n(\nm\n/\nz\n= 2) and H\n2\nO (\nm\n/\nz\n= 18) relative to Ar (\nm\n/\nz\n= 40), the production of hydrogen produced and the irreversible adsorption of water can be estimated (the results are shown in Fig.\n3f\n).\nTheoretical calculations\nAll calculations were executed within the density functional theory (DFT) framework using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (refs.\n37\n,\n38\n). The projector-augmented wave method was used to describe the interaction between the ions and electrons. Electron–electron exchange and correlation interactions were characterized using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional within the generalized gradient approximation\n39\n. A plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV and Gaussian electron smearing with a sigma of 0.02 eV was used to ensure accurate energies. The structures were relaxed using either the conjugate gradient algorithm or the quasi-Newton scheme until forces on all unfixed atoms were less than 0.01 eV Å\n−1\n.\nThe γ-Mo\n2\nN unit cell in\nFm3m\ncrystallographic symmetry was used. The calculated lattice parameters (4.17 Å) closely matched the experimental data (4.16 Å). A six-atom-layer slab modelled the γ-Mo\n2\nN (111) surface. Vacuum thickness was set to 15 Å to separate the slab in the\nz\ndirections, which was sufficient to avoid electronic coupling between adjacent slabs in test calculations. During geometry optimization, atoms in the bottom two layers were fixed as those in the bulk structure, whereas atoms in the four upper surface layers and the adsorbate were relaxed. For the methanol-reforming mechanism calculation, γ-Mo\n2\nN (111), Pt\n1\n/γ-Mo\n2\nN (111) and Pt (111) with 2 × 2 supercells were chosen, using (3 × 3 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack k-point sampling. For LaO\nx\nadsorption on γ-Mo\n2\nN (111), a six-layer 4 × 4 supercell slab model was used. The DFT + U method was applied to the\nf\norbitals of La, with a validated\nU\neff\nvalue of 7 eV for La from previous work on La\n2\nO\n3\n(ref.\n40\n).\nThe energy profile of the reaction routes was described starting from CH\n3\nOH and H\n2\nO molecules. The energy profile of the intermediate relative to CH\n3\nOH and H\n2\nO and the clean catalyst slab model was defined as\nE\nbinding\n=\nE\n(adsorbates/slab) −\nE\n(CH\n3\nOH) −\nE\n(H\n2\nO) −\nE\n(slab), where\nE\n(slab),\nE\n(CH\n3\nOH),\nE\n(H\n2\nO) and\nE\n(adsorbate/slab) represent the optimized clean slab, free CH\n3\nOH, H\n2\nO and relaxed adsorbates–slab complex energies, respectively. The activation barriers for elementary steps were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method\n41\n.\nFurthermore, the product adsorption energy was defined as\nE\nads\n=\nE\n(product/slab) −\nE\n(product) −\nE\n(slab), where\nE\n(slab),\nE\n(product) and\nE\n(product/slab) represent the optimized clean slab, free product molecule and relaxed product–slab complex energies, respectively. According to the aforementioned definition, a negative value signifies an exothermic process, whereas positive values indicate endothermic processes. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functionals were combined with D3 dispersion corrections to account for dispersion force fields\n37\n. Furthermore, vibrational frequencies were used to compute the zero-point energies of adsorbate intermediates and free molecules. Note that the energies of all configurations presented in this work include corrections for dispersion (D3) and zero-point energy."

Here, we report a simple and practical strategy to access the large-scale synthesis of single-atom catalysts via direct atoms emitting from bulk metals, and the subsequent trapping on nitrogen-rich porous carbon with the assistance of ammonia. First, the ammonia coordinates with the copper atoms to form volatile Cu(NH\n3\n)\nx\nspecies based on the strong Lewis acid–base interaction. Then, following transportation under an ammonia atmosphere, the Cu(NH\n3\n)\nx\nspecies are trapped by the defects on the nitrogen-rich carbon support, forming the isolated copper sites.

Various synthetic strategies, including physical and chemical approaches, have emerged in recent years as enabling platforms to access SACs. The physical methods, such as mass-selected soft-landing\n17\nand atomic layer deposition\n3\n,\n18\n, suffer from low yields and high costs that are not favourable for large-scale production. The chemical routes involve tedious synthetic processes, including the adsorption of metal precursors, followed by reduction and stabilization on defect-rich supports\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n. The reported chemical synthesis routes are also relatively difficult to scale up because of the complex operating steps and sensitive conditions. Furthermore, under a high reactive temperature, aggregation and sintering of small nanoparticles and single atoms on the support is inevitable to some extent, which greatly hinders the practical applications of SACs. Therefore, the development of a practical and straightforward strategy for the synthesis of SACs with high thermal/chemical stability and ease of mass production is particularly attractive in the field.\nIn a recent interesting and pioneering example, Datye and co-workers described the preparation of platinum single atoms supported on CeO\n2\nby thermal diffusion from platinum nanoparticles\n4\n,\n22\n. In contrast with the synthesis of SACs from nanoparticles, studies of the direct fabrication of SACs from cheap and readily available bulk metal materials have rarely been reported.\nHere, we describe a facile gas-migration strategy to directly transform bulk materials into single atoms onto a support with great potential for large-scale production. A schematic of the reaction is shown in Fig.\n1a\n: copper foam and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) were placed separately in a porcelain boat. The formation mechanism of copper single atoms supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu-SAs/N-C) is proposed in Fig.\n1b\n. First, the ZIF-8 was subjected to a pyrolysis process under an argon atmosphere at 1,173 K, forming pyrolysed ZIF-8 with empty zinc nodes and abundant defect sites. Under an ammonia atmosphere, ammonia molecules haul the surface copper atoms out of copper foam to form volatile Cu(NH\n3\n)\nx\nspecies based on strong Lewis acid–base interactions. Then, the Cu(NH\n3\n)\nx\nspecies were trapped by the defects of the nitrogen-rich carbon support, generating the isolated Cu-SAs/N-C catalysts. In addition, a series of M-SAs/N-C (M = Co or Ni) could be fabricated using this gas-migration method, demonstrating its generality to access a variety of functional SACs.\nFig. 1: Schematic of the preparation of Cu-SAs/N-C.\na\n, Apparatus diagram.\nb\n, Proposed reaction mechanism.\nFull size image\nResults\nSynthesis and structural"

However, the catalyst is sparse. By increasing the precursor concentrations, it will be denser but large NPs will form. One solution to this problem would be to pulverize the supports and the catalyst metals that are supposed to be on their surface to the nanoscale\n46\n. There should be numerous opportunities to design the supports as well as the loaded metal catalysts, but we emphasize that the supports and catalysts should be easy to manufacture and definitely be safe for handling by a worker who would prepare the catalytic layer. Moreover, such nanoscale catalysts should never be released to the environment during its lifetime. Finding a way to create highly dense ADNSCs will be a new frontier for practical catalysis. Resistance to fluctuations in temperature, CO and sulfur poisoning and constant mechanical jolting are other crucial parameters for catalysts that would be applied in the automotive industry.\nSteam reforming and other related methods involving water are simple, and treatments with low material or environmental costs have been shown to significantly improve the performance of the catalysts\n42\n,\n44\n,\n60\n,\n61\n,\n79\n. The detection of light atoms, such as H and O, will be the next great challenge in understanding the role of these species on catalysis, which is still difficult to determine using even state-of-art STEM and EXAFS measurements. However, there is no doubt that direct observation of such light elements would greatly advance our understanding of catalysis. Nuclear reaction analysis\n103\n, NMR, and advanced neutron diffraction techniques would play important roles in this regard.\nThe catalyst is usually visualized as remaining unchanged, in terms of its morphology, during the reaction; however, this would not be always true for nanocatalysts, as large-scale simulations of molecular dynamics and microkinetics modelling demonstrated\n104\n. They showed an interesting picture of the reaction of an Au\n20\nnanocluster on TiO\n2\n(110), in which an atom moves only a short distance from the cluster, captures CO for oxidation, and moves back to the cluster. Such detailed observations are currently limited to theoretical calculation and thus, a breakthrough in operand technique to visualize catalysis remains an issue for future analysis (Fig.\n1\n).\nSingle atoms and few-atom clusters are currently characterized by TEM and/or STM images and EXAFS to confirm the absence of metal–metal bonds. Since metal oxide supports are non-conductive, their STM observation needs a conductive material layer to be placed underneath the sample\n105\n. Applying advanced atomic force microscope (AFM) direct imaging to identify such single-atom or few-atom clusters seems promising\n106\n,\n107\n.\nThe intensity of the white line in X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and XPS spectra are often used to discuss the chemical states of nanocatalysts, but there are well-known final state effects that cause inherent size-dependent binding energy shifts to higher binding energy in XPS. Similar changes are seen in XANES analysis\n108\n. XANES, XPS and FTIR are complementary and indirect methods to determine the chemical states; hence, DFT-based Bader charge analysis is employed to calculate the atomic charges, as seen in Table\n1\n. Determining the real atomic charge of nanocatalysts experimentally remains a challenging task to date.\nThe study of catalysts is reaching the cooperative stage at which it is not only the metal atoms deposited on supports that play a role as an active site; the supports themselves also play an important and collaborative role in catalysis. To design a good ADNSC, choosing a material that has a low Δ\nE\nVO\n(or reducible or modified non-reducible oxides) would be a good starting point because it would stabilize the atom-scale catalysts on their surface.\nThe challenge and opportunities lie in the exploration of methods that enable a high dispersity of such single atom or few-atom clusters with high density. Single-atom-layer catalysis will be the ultimate limit, and we are curious to know the extent of its density and the optimal coverage for CO oxidation because these factors will govern the reaction path. Thus far, there appears to be no such method of preparing a laterally large two-dimensional catalyst layer, in which a monolayer of metal cations partly or entirely cover the surface of the oxide support, without stacking a second layer. Wet chemistry has played an important role in the development of practical automotive catalysts for long time, although we may have to consider other industrially established and more artificially controllable deposition techniques, such as physical and chemical vapor deposition methods that are often employed for thin film fabrication with atomic-level accuracy. There will be many useful feedbacks as techniques of such two-dimensional, dense, mass-efficient single-atom-layer catalysis are established and will be linked to future automotive applications of ADNSCs."

CeO\n2\nnanorods were prepared according to a procedure reported elsewhere\n35\n,\n36\n. The synthesis scheme is depicted in Supplementary Fig.\n1a\n. In brief, 25 g of NaOH (reagent grade ≥98%) was dissolved in 30 ml of demineralized water. A solution of 2.17 g of Ce(NO\n3\n)∙6H\n2\nO (99% purity) in 5 ml of demineralized water was prepared. Subsequently, the two solutions were poured together, and the obtained slurry was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Next, the volume was increased to ~100 ml by adding demineralized water and the slurry was transferred into a 125 ml Teflon liner. This liner was then sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave, which was placed in an oven for 24 h at 100 °C. After cooling in a water bath, the obtained precipitate was washed with five cycles of centrifugation, decantation and redispersion until a pH of ~7–8 was obtained. The resulting solid was dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 80 °C and then calcined in air at 500 °C. Subsequently, a Pd wet impregnation of CeO\n2\nnanorods using Pd(NO\n3\n)∙2H\n2\nO as the Pd precursor was performed. An appropriate amount of Pd salt was dissolved in demineralized water (10 ml) and poured onto the calcined CeO\n2\npowder. The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min at room temperature and then slowly heated to evaporate the water without boiling. The obtained solid was dried overnight at 110 °C and subsequently calcined in air at 300 °C. The calcined samples were denoted as 1PdRods and 5PdRods, depending on the intended Pd loading.\nThe FSP synthesis was performed using a commercial TETHIS NPS10 apparatus. The principal scheme of the synthesis set-up can be found in Supplementary Fig.\n1b\n. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Ce(acac)∙H\n2\nO (99.9% purity) and Pd(acac)\n2\n∙H\n2\nO (99% purity) salts (acac, acetylacetone) in glacial acetic acid (99.7% purity), which gave rise to a 0.1 M Ce precursor solution, and the Pd molarity was varied to target a particular Pd loading. To increase the solubility of the salts, the solution was heated slightly to ~50 °C and stirred for 0.5 h. The fully transparent solution was then transferred into the syringe of the FSP set-up. The solution was injected at a feed rate of 5 ml min\n−1\ninto the methane/oxygen flame (1.5 l min\n−1\nof methane and 3.0 l min\n−1\nof oxygen). An oxygen flow of 5.0 l min\n−1\nwas used for the dispersion of the solution, which gave rise to an overpressure at the nozzle of ~2.5 bar. On pyrolysis in the flame, the NPs were formed and deposited on the quartz fibre filter in the upper part of the set-up (Supplementary Fig.\n1\n). The powders collected from the filter were denoted as 1PdFSP and 5PdFSP, depending on the intended Pd loading."

The EXAFS spectra were collected by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step. Then, the\nχ\n(\nk\n) data of the Ir L\n3\n-edge were Fourier transformed to real (R) space using a Hanning window (\ndk\n= 1.0 Å\n−1\n) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. To obtain the quantitative structural parameters around central atoms\n60\n, we performed least-squares curve parameter fitting by using the ARTEMIS module of the IIRFFIT software packages. The following EXAFS equation was used:\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\chi \\left( k \\right) = \\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_j {\\frac{{N_jS_0^2F_j\\left( k \\right)}}{{k\\,R_j^2}}} \\exp \\left[ { - 2\\,k^2\\sigma _j^2} \\right]\\exp \\left[ {\\frac{{ - 2\\,R_j}}{{\\lambda \\left( k \\right)}}} \\right]\\\\ \\sin \\left[ {2k\\,R_j + \\phi _j\\left( k \\right)} \\right]\\end{array}$$\n(1)\nIn equation (\n1\n)\n\\(S_0^2\\)\nis the amplitude reduction factor,\nF\nj\n(\nk\n)\nis\nthe effective curved-wave backscattering amplitude,\nN\nj\nis the number of neighbours in the\nj\nth atomic shell,\nR\nj\nis the distance between the X-ray absorbing central atom and the atoms in the\nj\nth atomic shell (backscatterer),\nλ\nis the mean free path in Å,\nσ\nj\nis the Debye–Waller parameter of the\nj\nth atomic shell (variation of distances around the average\nR\nj\n) and\nϕ\nj\n(\nk\n) is the phase shift (including the phase shift for each shell and the total central atom phase shift).

The reaction vial was sealed and stirred at 60 °C for 20 h. After cooling to room temperature, the volatiles were removed by rotary evaporation and the obtained crude mixture was purified by silica gel flash chromatography using petroleum ether and EtOAc as eluents. The molar ratio of products was determined by\n1\nH-NMR spectroscopy.\nComputational methods\nDFT calculations were conducted using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package with the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof\n62\nperforming the generalized gradient approximation. A 8 × 8 single-layer graphene with 15 Å vacuum space was built to describe the model of Ir-SA, where the Ir atom was stabilized by four N atoms and the surface was also doped with S and P atoms (Supplementary Fig.\n32a\n). A Monkhorst–Pack\nk\n-point 2 × 2 × 1 was used in all the calculations for Ir-SA. The reaction over Ir(ttp)COCl catalyst was calculated in a large supercell with a lattice of 20 × 20 × 20 Å\n3\nto avoid interactions in the periodic calculations, where a Monkhorst–Pack\nk\n-point 1 × 1 × 1 was used (Supplementary Fig.\n32b\n). Ir–porphyrin (Supplementary Fig.\n33a\n) was employed in DFT studies of the catalytic reaction using Ir(ttp)COCl (Supplementary Fig.\n33b\n) due to the large computational costs. The calculated adsorption energy of carbene (C\n6\nH\n5\nCCOOCH\n3\n) to these two structures displayed only a small difference (0.07 eV), which supports the reliability of the model constructed using Ir–porphyrin (Supplementary Table\n5\n). A 400 eV cut-off energy was set for the plane-wave basis set.

To prepare engineered CeO\n2\n, tetraamineplatinum nitrate solution was impregnated onto CeO\n2\npowder by conventional wet impregnation, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h. The powder was then calcined at 800 °C for 10 h in flowing air. The obtained materials were denoted as 1Pt@CeO\n2\nand 3Pt@CeO\n2\n, corresponding to the Pt loadings of 1 and 3 wt.%, respectively. The high temperature treatment causes a drop in BET surface area, from 135 m\n2\ng\n−1\nfor the as-received ceria to 60 m\n2\ng\n−1\nfor the pure ceria (PS ceria), 78 m\n2\ng\n−1\nfor 1Pt@CeO\n2\nand 100 m\n2\ng\n−1\nfor the 3Pt@CeO\n2\nsample.

An appropriate amount of tetraamineplatinum nitrate (Pt(NH\n3\n)\n4\n(NO\n3\n)\n2\n) was added to each support followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h and calcination at 500 °C for 4 h in air. The total Pt loading for each catalyst was 3 wt.% Pt and the samples were denoted as 3 wt.%Pt/PS ceria and 2Pt/1Pt@CeO\n2\n.\nFor the methane oxidation study, we used ceria powder prepared in the laboratory via decomposition of Ce(NO\n3\n)\n3\n, as described in our previous work\n26\n. This ceria powder has a BET surface area of 85 m\n2\ng\n−1\nas prepared. To prepare the engineered catalyst support, we used 2 wt.% Pt via impregnation, drying in air, calcination at 500 °C following by ageing in air at 800 °C for 10 h. This catalyst support is denoted as 2Pt@CeO\n2\n. Palladium nitrate (1.09 wt.% Pd) was deposited on the 2Pt@CeO\n2\nby wet impregnation, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h and calcining at 500 °C for 4 h in air. The catalyst was denoted as 1Pd/2Pt@CeO\n2\n. To provide a comparison, we also prepared two reference samples of 1Pd/CeO\n2\n(1.09 wt.%Pd) and (1Pd + 2Pt)/CeO\n2\ncontaining the same loading of metal as the 1Pd/2Pt@CeO\n2\n. For the reference (1Pd + 2Pt)/CeO\n2\ncatalyst (BET surface area 64 m\n2\ng\n−1\n), the palladium(II) nitrate solution was impregnated onto the CeO\n2\nfirst, then dried at 120 °C in air for 12 h. After calcination at 500 °C in air for 4 h, tetraamineplatinum nitrate (2 wt.% Pt) was impregnated onto the material progressively, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h in air and calcining at 500 °C for 4 h in air. The reference 1Pd/CeO\n2\n(1.09 wt.%Pd) sample was prepared by impregnating appropriate amount of palladium(II) nitrate solution onto the CeO\n2\n. Then, the sample was obtained after drying at 120 °C in air for 12 h and calcining at 500 °C in air for 4 h.

For the synthesis of Pd\n1\n/ND and Pd\nn\nx\n/ND (\nx\n= 1, 2), typically, 200 mg ND (99.9% purity, Beijing Grish Hitech) was first dispersed in 45 ml deionized water in a 100 ml round-bottom flask, followed by 30 min sonication to achieve a homogeneous suspension. Then, the flask was immersed into a 100 °C oil bath after the pH value of the ND suspension was adjusted to ~10 by using freshly prepared Na\n2\nCO\n3\nsolution (0.25 M). Afterwards, 5 ml of freshly pH-neutralized Pd(NO\n3\n)\n2\nsolution of various concentrations was added dropwise to the stirring ND suspension and kept at 100 °C for 1 h under continuous stirring. Finally, these as-prepared Pd/ND samples were dried under vacuum at 60 °C after washing twice with deionized water.\nThe synthesis of samples with larger crystalline palladium NPs as the dominant geometries (that is, Pd\np\ny\n/ND,\ny\n= 1, 2, 3) was realized by either the incipient-wetness impregnation method (Pd\np1\n/ND and Pd\np3\n/ND) or chemical reduction methods (Pd\np2\n/ND). For the synthesis of Pd\np1\n/ND, 200 mg ND was wetted by 800 μl diluted Pd(NO\n3\n)\n2\nsolution in a 10 ml crucible, then the slurry was stirred slowly at room temperature overnight and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. For the synthesis of Pd\np3\n/ND, 800 μl diluted Pd(NO\n3\n)\n2\nsolution with an additional 120 mg citric acid was used to wet 200 mg ND. Afterwards, the slurry was stirred at room temperature overnight and dried at 120 °C for 12 h. The synthesis of Pd\np2\n/ND was based on a previous publication with some modifications\n45\n. In a typical synthesis, 540 μl PdCl\n2\n–HCl solution (10 mg PdCl\n2\ndissolved in 1 ml 0.4 M HCl) was mixed with 0.30 mmol trisodium citrate in 80 ml deionized water, then 200 mg ND was added to the above solution, followed by 30 min sonication to achieve a homogeneous suspension. A newly prepared 10 ml NaBH\n4\nsolution (0.1 M) was then added dropwise to the above suspension under stirring at 60 °C and the stirring was continued at 60 °C for 6 h. Finally, the as-prepared sample was washed three times with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 12 h.\nAfter drying, different catalyst precursors were reduced by diluted H\n2\n(10% H\n2\n/Ar, 30 ml min\n−1\n) at 573 K (except for Pd\n1\n/ND, for which the reduction temperature was set at 473 K to prevent the aggregation of Pd\n1\nsites) for 1 h, followed with passivation treatment at room temperature with diluted O\n2\n(0.5 % O\n2\n/Ar, 30 ml min\n−1\n) for 12 h.\nCatalyst"

In brief, 0.95 mM Zn(NO\n3\n)\n2\n·6H\n2\nO and 0.05 mM FeSO\n4\n·7H\n2\nO as metal sources, and 8.21 g of 2-methylimidazole as the organic linker, were mixed with methanol to form Fe-doped ZIF-8. The excess organic linker and metal sources were removed by washing the product three times with absolute ethanol. After drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight, Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursor was directly heat-treated in Ar gas (99.99% purity) at 1,000 °C for 1 h to derive the final Fe–N–C catalyst. Atomically dispersed Fe atoms were uniformly distributed on the N–C framework without further acid washes. The weight of Fe loading in the final catalyst was around 2.0 wt%.\nAccording to our previous work, impregnation of Fe–N–C with an ultralow Pt loading could significantly promote the durability of Fe–N–C, but it did not present a noticeable activity improvement, especially in the kinetic region\n39\n. In this follow-up work, ammonia heat treatment was designed to expose more active sites and tailor the properties of the carbon support and the coordination number of single atoms. Secondary Ar pyrolysis after ammonia treatment is designed to stabilize the carbon framework. Thus, Fe-doped ZIF-8 was used as the support for Pt impregnation in this work to simplify heat treatment protocols. Pt(II) acetylacetonate (10 mg) was homogeneously dispersed in 3 ml of ethanol via ultrasonication until the solvent became transparent. In the meantime, 110 mg of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol was added to the Pt solution to provide a sufficient nitrogen source for Pt coordination. Around 400 mg of Fe-doped ZIF-8 was added to the above solution to form a uniform suspension. After drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight, the solid was collected and ball milled (ZrO\n2\nball, 350 revolutions per minute (r.p.m.), 4 h) to uniformly distribute Pt and N sources on the Fe-doped ZIF-8 support. The mixed precursors were first treated in NH\n3\ngas at 900 °C for 15 min and then transferred to an Ar atmosphere at 1,000 °C for 1 h to remove Zn in the precursor and stabilize the whole carbon framework to produce the final catalyst, Pt-Fe-N-C. The Pt and Fe loadings were around 1.7 and 2.0 wt%, respectively.\nAs a reference electrocatalyst, Pt–N–C was prepared from a ZIF-8 support, which was formed by mixing 1 mM Zn(NO\n3\n)\n2\n·6H\n2\nO and 8.21 g of 2-methylimidazole in a methanol solvent and following the same collecting and drying protocols as for Fe-doped ZIF-8. Similarly, 10 mg of platinum(II) acetylacetonate was homogeneously dispersed in 3 ml of ethanol via ultrasonication until the solvent became transparent. In the meantime, 110 mg of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol was added to the Pt solution to provide a sufficient nitrogen source for Pt coordination. Around 400 mg of ZIF-8 was added to this solution to form a uniform suspension. After drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight, the solid was collected and ball milled (ZrO\n2\nball, 350 r.p.m., 4 h) to uniformly distribute the Pt and N sources on the ZIF-8 support. The mixed precursors were also initially treated in NH\n3\ngas at 900 °C for 15 min and then transferred into an Ar atmosphere at 1,000 °C for 1 h. The final catalyst, Pt–N–C, had a Pt loading of 2.3 wt%.\nPhysical"

To prevent this, a second metal (for example, Sn\n13\n,\n14\n, Zn\n15\n,\n16\n, Ga\n17\nor Mn\n18\n) can be incorporated. So far, Sn and Zn when confined respectively in the zeolite channels with Pt have been the two most promising options for the preparation of high-performance bimetallic PDH catalysts\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n19\n. For example, subnanometric PtSn\n13\nand PtZn\n15\nbimetallic clusters encapsulated in the MFI zeolite have been successfully synthesized to improve the stability of Pt clusters, resulting in a high PDH performance. However, the real active sites for these two kinds of bimetallic PDH catalyst are different. Sun et al. proposed that the catalytically active species had the structure of a Pt–Zn alloy, with the PtZn\n4\nalloy clusters exhibiting the best PDH performance\n15\n. By contrast, Liu et al. proposed that Pt and Sn possibly existed in the form of the Sn–O–Pt bond in the K-PtSn@MFI catalysts prepared\n19\n, rather than the well-established alloys mentioned in other literature reports\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n. Nevertheless, increasing studies have indicated that, for bimetallic Pt–metal alloy catalysts, the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability are improved at the expense of the PDH activity, even causing irreversible catalyst deactivation\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n,\n22\n. Therefore, developing encapsulated Pt clusters with a non-alloy structure is of great interest for the purpose of overcoming the activity–stability trade-off for PDH.\nFor zeolite-confined Pt catalysts, the as-prepared Pt\nx\n–O–M\ny\n(M = Sn, Zn, among others) species tend to evolve into the less active PtM alloy during high-temperature pre-reduction or the PDH reaction operated above 550 °C. For example, we have shown that active Pt\nx\nclusters stabilized in Pt@Sn-Beta via Pt–O–Sn bonds can be partially transformed into the Pt\nx\nSn\ny\nalloy under either harsh pretreatment (calcination–reduction or direct reduction) or long-term reaction processes due to the unstable skeleton-Sn species, which leads to the eventual catalyst deactivation\n24\n. Furthermore, for the Sn-Beta-confined Pt catalysts, the location of the Pt species in the zeolite framework is hard to control due to the random distribution of skeleton-Sn species. Thus, alternative strategies are required to control the placement of guest Pt while inhibiting the reduction of framework heterometal atoms; moreover, zeolites with larger pores are needed to provide improved diffusion and accommodation capability for the guest metal source during wet-impregnation processes. As elements in the same group, the framework Ge\n4+\nion is more difficult to be reduced than the Sn\n4+\nion. Thus, the germanosilicate zeolites with abundant framework Ge\n4+\nions and extra-large pores are considered to be better candidates as the carriers\n25\n,\n26\n. However, they exhibit poor hydrothermal stability even at room temperature due to easy hydrolysis of the Ge–O bonds, which greatly limits their use. This does, however, endow them with structurally modifiable properties\n27\n,\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n,\n31\n. In particular, the assembly–disassembly–organization–reassembly (or ADOR) process can selectively destroy the double-four-membered-ring (d4r) subunits in germanosilicates to obtain two-dimensional (2D) layered intermediates\n27\n, which can be reassembled into a series of three-dimensional (3D) daughter structures\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n,\n31\n. Using such approaches, Pt\n32\n, Pd\n33\nand Rh\n34\nnanoparticles have been successfully encapsulated in some of the derived zeolites. Confining metal species within the interlamellar space during the transformation of 2D lamellar precursors into 3D zeolites is effective\n32\n,\n33\n,\n34\n,\n35\n; however; only specific zeolite structures with a modifiable interlayer structure are applicable for this approach.\nHere we use an alternative strategy without any structural transformation during the process of encapsulating metals. We use a thermally/hydrothermally stable UTL-type germanosilicate (Ge-UTL), obtained via acidic treatment, as an alternative support to confine the Pt species, aiming to take advantage of its extra-large 14-membered-ring (14-MR) pores, high content of stable skeleton-Ge species and the specific d4r subunits. The Pt@Ge-UTL catalyst was readily prepared from the Ge-UTL carrier and H\n2\nPtCl\n6\nvia simple wet impregnation and subsequent H\n2\nreduction. The special d4r building units and the Ge ions enriched therein cooperate synergistically to limit the location of Pt in the 14-MR channels, generating encapsulated subnanometric Pt clusters with ultra-high stability and a high PDH performance.\nResults\nConfining subnanometric Pt clusters in UTL-type zeolites\nThe aim of this study lies in the construction of a confined metal catalyst that demonstrates a heat-resistant structure, high porosity and subnanometric Pt clusters scattered in a well-defined location. To this end, a series of UTL-type zeolites with various Si/Ge atomic ratios (that is, 31–227) and stable skeleton structures were prepared to serve as the Pt supports. These were prepared via acid pickling of the as-made Ge-UTL (Si/Ge = 4.7) (for detailed information see Supplementary Note\n1\n, Supplementary Figs.\n1\n–\n7\nand Supplementary Table\n1\n), during which both structure protection by the organic structure-directing agents inside the pores and skeleton stabilization through replacement of the Ge atoms (mainly in the d4r units) with Si atoms was realized\n36\n. We used a calcined sample of the pristine Ge-UTL (named as UTL-C) as well as calcined samples of several acid-pickling-stabilized materials as the Pt supports, which were treated via simple wet impregnation, using chloroplatinic acid as the Pt precursor, all with the same Pt loading of 0.375 wt%. Supplementary Figure\n8\nshows the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-impregnated precursors without H\n2\nreduction (where the suffix ‘P’ indicates the pristine sample, that is, before reduction). The crystalline structure of pristine UTL-C which has a high germanium content (Si/Ge = 4.7) was extremely unstable, and the UTL topological structure was destroyed after Pt impregnation in the aqueous system as a result of extensive hydrolysis of the skeleton Ge. Nevertheless, the supports prepared via acid pickling for ≥2 h endured Pt impregnation well as they possessed a highly stabilized skeleton structure. In addition, the textural properties of surface area and pore volume showed consistent results (Supplementary Fig.\n9\nand Supplementary Table\n2\n). Compared with the pristine UTL-C sample, Pt impregnation led to a sharp decrease in the specific surface area and micropore volume for Pt-UTL-C-P. By contrast, the materials stabilized by acid pickling for ≥2 h maintained their porous structure well during Pt impregnation.\nThe inhibition of particle sintering and aggregation against high-temperature reduction is always preferred in the preparation of Pt nanoparticles or subnanoparticles. In our case, the Ge-UTL germanosilicates with a large skeleton-Ge content and a stabilized structure are promising to highly disperse and stabilize the Pt species. The PXRD patterns demonstrated that the final catalysts prepared from stabilized supports retained the original UTL structure and possessed a comparable crystallinity (Fig.\n1a\n). Most importantly, no obvious diffraction attributed to large Pt particles was observed for these target catalysts after further H\n2\nreduction (Fig.\n1a\n), indicating that the Pt species are highly dispersed in the Pt-A-2h(31)\n-\nR, Pt-A-3h(44)-R, Pt-A-6h(52)-R and Pt-A-12h(58)-R catalysts (in the catalyst naming system used for Pt-A-\nx\nh(\ny\n)-R, Pt and A denote Pt impregnation and acid treatment, respectively,\nx\nis the acid-pickling time in hours,\ny\ndenotes the corresponding Si/Ge molar ratio and R indicates direct H\n2\nreduction). The stability of the thus-formed Pt nanoclusters under flowing H\n2\nat different temperatures was monitored via in situ PXRD. As shown in Supplementary Figs.\n10\n–\n13\n, with an increasing reduction temperature, the diffraction peaks related to the Pt and PtGe species remained invisible even after reduction at 600 °C, indicating that Pt or its bimetallic species formed with Ge was too small in size to be detected using the X-ray diffraction technique. These results strongly imply that the Pt species are highly dispersed and confined in the matrix or pores of the zeolite supports. The Pt-A-24h-twice(227)-R catalyst was an exception and it showed a weak and broad diffraction of Pt(111) (Fig.\n1a\n, 5), because the amount of skeleton Ge was not sufficient to immobilize and disperse the Pt species.\nFig. 1: Dispersity of Pt species in a series of UTL zeolites with different Si/Ge ratios.\na\n, Wide-angle PXRD patterns and enlarged reflections (inset) for catalysts Pt-A-2h(31)-R (1), Pt-A-3h(44)-R (2), Pt-A-6h(52)-R (3), Pt-A-12h(58)-R (4) and Pt-A-24h-twice(227)-R (5).

The insets in\nd\n–\ng\nand\ni\n–\nk\nshow histograms of the Pt particle size distributions.\nSource data\nFull size image\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed to visually determine the size of the Pt species. No visible metal particles were observed in the reduced Pt-A-2h(31)\n-\nR sample when the images were obtained with a normal mode at either low or high magnification (Fig.\n1b,c\n, respectively). For Pt-A-3h(44)-R, Pt-A-6h(52)-R and Pt-A-12h(58)-R with lower amounts of Ge, although the PXRD patterns did not show any Pt-species-related diffraction peaks, metal nanoparticles of 2–4 nm in size were detected in the TEM images at low magnification (Fig.\n1d–f\n). With a prolonged acid-pickling time, the Ge content is gradually decreased, while the detectable metal particles increased in both number and particle size. In particular, the Pt-A-24h-twice(227)-R sample prepared using the quasi-UTL-type silicate (Si/Ge = 227) as the carrier possessed much larger Pt nanoparticles (3–8 nm) that were unevenly distributed on the surface of the zeolite crystals (Fig.\n1g\n). Therefore, it is impossible to confine the Pt species within the matrix or pores of a Ge-UTL zeolite that lacks sufficient skeleton-Ge species.\nSubsequently, spherical-aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-corrected HAADF-STEM) revealed the presence of ultra-fine Pt clusters of 0.2–0.8 nm in size in the Pt-A-2h(31)-R sample (Fig.\n1h–k\nand Supplementary Fig.\n14a\n). The observed cluster sizes correspond to several Pt atoms, consistent with the in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results, which confirm that the Pt clusters in Pt-A-2h(31)-R comprise, on average, four Pt atoms (see EXAFS analysis in the later section on identification of the active species in Pt@Ge-UTL). The diffuse HAADF-STEM image contrast observed in some regions can be attributed to the fact that the Pt clusters separated along the projection direction appear to merge together in the projected image (Supplementary Fig.\n14b\n) and should not be mistaken for larger particles. Similar illusions are actually common in the HAADF-STEM imaging of supported ultra-fine-cluster (or single-atom) noble metal catalysts\n11\n,\n15\n. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy elemental mapping reveals that Ge and Pt are uniformly distributed throughout the zeolite crystal (Fig.\n1l,m\n). In summary, the Ge-UTL zeolite that contains sufficient skeleton-Ge species and a highly stable crystalline structure is a suitable support for achieving dispersed Pt loading.\nTo characterize the electronic state of Pt, infrared spectroscopy has been used widely to study carbon monoxide (CO) adsorbed on Pt. The CO vibration bands vary with their adsorption states (linear or bridged adsorption), which are closely related to the chemical environments of the Pt sites. The size and possible position of the Pt species in zeolites can therefore be quantitatively determined\n16\n,\n35\n,\n37\n,\n38\n,\n39\n. In situ infrared spectra with the CO probe molecule were collected for the Pt-supported UTL catalysts (Supplementary Fig.\n15a\n). The linear adsorption of CO molecules on the surface of Pt species emerged for all the samples, although notably different bands were shown due to the varying proportions of Pt species with distinct chemical environments\n37\n. The band at 2,048 cm\n−1\nis assigned to CO adsorption on the step or kink sites of the Pt(111) surface of large nanoparticles\n38\n, indicating the presence of large Pt species or particles on the external surface of the zeolite crystals\n35\n. The bands at 2,079 cm\n−1\nand 2,010 cm\n−1\ncan be attributed to the symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching of Pt(CO)\n2\nspecies, respectively, where the confined subnanometric Pt is coordinated by two CO molecules\n16\n. For further confirmation, we demonstrated the distribution by simulating the adsorption of CO on a theoretical structural model of Pt(111) (simulating the superficial Pt nanoparticles) and on Pt@UTL (Supplementary Fig.\n15b,c\n, respectively). These theoretical calculations confirmed that the three adsorption peaks of 2,048, 2,079 and 2,010 cm\n−1\nare ascribed, respectively, to CO linearly adsorbed on Pt(111) (simulating the superficial Pt nanoparticles) as well as the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching modes of the Pt(CO)\n2\nspecies. In particular, the two CO molecules in the Pt(CO)\n2\nspecies are coordinated to Pt atoms that are not interacting with the zeolite framework of the zeolite-channel-confined subnanometric Pt clusters. The relative intensity of each vibration band shows a good correlation with the adsorption capacity of CO on Pt, and thus the ratio of Pt species at the different positions can be determined based on the band intensity. The Pt-A-2h(31)-R sample showed the strongest absorption band at 2,010 cm\n−1\n, indicating that almost all the Pt species were confined inside the UTL channels. However, when the Ge content in the carriers decreased successively with elongation of the pickling time, more Pt nanoparticles were located on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, thus providing an intense band at 2,048 cm\n−1\n. Particularly in the case of the Pt-A-24h-twice(227)-R sample that is almost Ge-free, the 2,048 cm\n−1\nband dominated the infrared spectrum of CO adsorption, verifying that it contained numerous large-sized Pt species existing on the crystal surface rather than in the channels.\nSimilar results have also been demonstrated through a quasi in situ investigation using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary Fig.\n16\n). The Pt 4\nf\nsignal intensity of Pt-A-2h(31)-R was extremely weak and negligible in comparison with Pt-A-24h-twice(227)-R. The Pt species in the Pt-A-2h(31)-R sample were almost undetected using the XPS surface-"

Previously pre-treated catalysts (that is, previously reduced supported Au precursor) were used for H\n2\nadsorption studies. The sample (200–300 mg) was loaded into a U-tube, evacuated at 150 °C for 1 h and then reduced in flowing H\n2\nat 150 °C for 1 h to remove any adsorbed oxygen. Following the pre-treatment, the sample was evacuated, purged with helium for 30 min and cooled to the analysis temperature under an active vacuum. A series of two isotherm H\n2\nadsorption experiments were performed at 60, 90 and 120 °C; the sample was evacuated to at least 10 μm Hg for 1 h at the adsorption temperature between isotherms.\nWe note any adsorbed oxygen in the system must be removed before reversible H\n2\nadsorption can be observed either via volumetric adsorption or with Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy. Once care is taken to remove adsorbed oxygen, the first and the second isotherms are essentially indistinguishable. Therefore, for all further volumetric adsorption measurements described hereafter, reported hydrogen uptakes were determined by averaging the first and second isotherms at each pressure point.\nFTIR spectroscopy\nIR spectra were collected on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 470 FTIR spectrometer in a home-built heated (20–300 °C) transmission flow cell. Gas flow rates were controlled using rotameters calibrated with a bubble flowmeter. Water in the feed gases was minimized by passing the reactive gas through a dry ice–isopropanol moisture trap immediately before entering the IR cell. For H\n2\nadsorption experiments, ~40–50 mg of catalyst sample was pressed (3 tons of pressure for 10 s) into a 13 mm circular pellet, which was mounted in the flow cell. The sample pellet was pre-treated under 25 standard cubic centimetres per minute (SCCM) of N\n2\nat 300 °C for 1 h to eliminate surface carbonates, and then cooled to 50 °C. The vapour pressure of water at −78 °C is 0.5 mTorr (660 ppb). Even with the dry ice–isopropanol bath, sub-ppm levels of residual water from the gas stream adsorb on the surface at lower temperatures. We allowed the surface water coverage to equilibrate until the water bending band at 1,620 cm\n−1\nwas stable before conducting further experiments. On the basis of our previous work and the absorbance of the\nδ\nHOH\nbending vibration, we estimate the surface water coverage to be around 2–3 H\n2\nO molecules nm\n−2\n(ref.\n21\n).\nAfter stabilization of the water bending mode, a mixture of 20 SCCM H\n2\nand 25 SCCM N\n2\nwas flowed over the catalyst at 50 °C for 1 h to ensure no weakly adsorbed O\n2\nremained on the pellet. Catalysts were kept under N\n2\nflow to ensure the weakly adsorbed H\n2\nis removed. H\n2\nadsorption experiments were then performed at desired temperatures by flowing the desired ratio of H\n2\nand N\n2\nover the catalyst.\nTransmission electron microscopy\nGold particle sizes were determined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Catalysts were imaged with scanning/transmission electron microscopy using an FEI Talos F200X microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. A small quantity of each sample was crushed in an agate mortar and dispersed in ethanol with sonication. A few drops of this suspension were placed on a Cu TEM grid (Ted Pella) and allowed to dry before inserting into the microscope for analysis. The number-averaged diameter for Au nanoparticles was determined with ImageJ from the measurement of >200 particles (Supplementary Fig.\n1\n). Supplementary Table\n1\ncompiles TEM, and BET"

From a mechanistic perspective, the Mo centre in its partially reduced state is found to be critical for an oxidation reaction to generate active oxygen species from O\n2\n, which extends our understanding of typical catalytic oxidation processes.\nMethods\nSample preparation\nPhosphomolybdic acid hydrate (PMA hydrate; H\n3\nPMo\n12\nO\n40\n·\nx\nH\n2\nO), phosphotungstic acid hydrate (PTA hydrate; H\n3\nPW\n12\nO\n40\n·\nx\nH\n2\nO), palladium(II) nitrate hydrate (Pd(NO\n3\n)\n2\n·\nx\nH\n2\nO, ~40% Pd basis), rhodium(III) trinitrate hydrate (Rh(NO\n3\n)\n3\n·\nx\nH\n2\nO, ~36% Rh basis), H\n2\nO\n2\n(35%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; anhydrous, ≥99.9%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Platinum(IV) nitrate solution (15% Pt basis) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Deuterium oxide (D\n2\nO; D, 99.9%) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. All the chemicals were used without further treatment. A co-precipitation method was adopted for the synthesis of different samples. Taking Pd/CsPMA as an example, PMA hydrate (1.5 g) was dissolved in ultrapure water (30 ml) acidified with two drops of concentrated HNO\n3\n(65–68%) to obtain the heteropoly acid solution. The cation stock solution was prepared by adding CsNO\n3\n(390 mg) and Pd(NO\n3\n)\n2\n·\nx\nH\n2\nO (28 mg) to ultrapure water (30 ml) with two drops of concentrated HNO\n3\n.

Stirring of the mixed suspension was continued for another 5 h at 0 °C, followed by centrifugation to separate the solid. The solid was washed further with ultrapure water three times, dried using a freeze-dryer, and carefully ground for use. To obtain the POM without Pd, the cation solution contained only Cs\n+\nfor the precipitation of [PMo\n12\nO\n40\n]\n3−\n. As for Pd/CsPTA, PTA hydrate (2.16 g) was used as the POM precursor instead, while the amount of Pd(NO\n3\n)\n2\nhydrate was adjusted to 8.6 mg."

                "output": "In a paper with doi: 10.1038_s41929-023-01039-7, synthesis of Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt, we studied its stability using online GDE/EFC/ICP–MS at 0.6 V\nRHE\nand 353 K under O\n2\nflow. Notably, despite its similar initial ORR activity with Fe\n0.5\nNC, the Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt reveals much better retention of ORR activity during a 2 h potentiostatic hold (−35% and −60% for Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt and Fe\n0.5\nNC, respectively; Fig.\n4a\n). The GDE/EFC/ICP–MS results measured under Ar flow show ~3 times less Fe leaching from Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt than Fe\n0.5\nNC (that is, 465 and 1,285 μg\nFe\ng\ncatal\n−1\n, respectively; Fig.\n4b\n), without discernable Pt dissolution (Supplementary Fig.\n43\n). Unlike Fe\n0.5\nNC (Fig.\n2e\n), the lifetime-dependent stability diagram of Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt shows a close interrelation of\nj\nloss with a decrease in TOF, rather than a decrease in SD (Supplementary Fig.\n44\n). Thus, these results imply that the enhanced stability of Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt may result from the stabilization of Fe–N\n4\nsites against demetallation as a consequence of the introduction of isolated Pt sites in the carbon matrix.\nFig. 4: Proof-of-concept strategy with isolated Pt ion as a stabilizer of Fe–N\n4\nsites.\na\n,\nb\n, ORR current density (\na\n) and real-time Fe dissolution under Ar flow (\nb\n) of Fe\n0.5\nNC/GDE and Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt/GDE obtained by online GDE/EFC/ICP–MS during 2 h potential hold at 0.6 V\nRHE\nand 353 K.

For comparison, the initial PRR polarization curve of Pt/C is also shown.\nFull size image\nWe further found that the enhanced stability, concluded from the GDE/EFC/ICP–MS system, was also transferred to the PEMFC. At the beginning of operation, the Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt cathode showed similar PEMFC performance to that of the Fe\n0.5\nNC cathode. However, PEMFC with Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt cathode exhibited much superior stability during 50 h of operation at 0.5 V (Fig.\n4c,d\n; the cell voltage corresponds to the cathode potential of ~0.6 V\nRHE\nconsidering the anodic overpotential and Ohmic loss in PEMFC\n38\n). To identify whether the enhanced stability is attributed to a possible artefact originating from the operando agglomeration of isolated Pt sites into ORR-active particles, the Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt cathode was separated from the membrane–electrode assembly (MEA) after the test and post-mortem characterized. In the HAADF-STEM image, no discernible changes were observed in the atomic distribution of the Pt species after 50 h of PEMFC operation (Fig.\n4e\n). In addition, the FT- and WT-EXAFS plots for the aged Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt revealed a dominant Pt–N interaction, without a perceptible signal from Pt–Pt interaction (Fig.\n4f\nand Supplementary Fig.\n45\n), almost identical to that for the pristine Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt. More evidently, the aged Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt recorded a PRR onset potential of 0.81 V\nRHE,\nwhich is much lower than that of Pt/C (0.92 V\nRHE\n) and pristine Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt and Fe\n0.5\nNC (0.83 V\nRHE\n), and similar to that of aged Fe\n0.5\nNC (0.81 V\nRHE\n; Fig.\n4g\n). The results therefore indicated no formation of highly active Pt nanoclusters and particles during PEMFC operation. In addition, it can be safely ruled out that Pt single atoms could lead to improved stability by acting as peroxide scavengers (Supplementary Note\n7\nand Supplementary Fig.\n46\n). Therefore, the fundamental origin of the enhanced stability of PEMFC with Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt cathode is unveiled as isolated Pt-induced stabilization of catalytic Fe–N\n4\nsites against demetallation. Finally, even though a noble element Pt is used and the Pt-modified catalyst is not optimized in the present study, this proof-of-concept study validates that various synthetic approaches can be established to avoid Fe demetallation of active Fe–N\n4\nsites, a critical degradation path dominating a rapid performance drop during the initial PEMFC operation.\nConclusions\nIn this work, we quantitatively resolve the two key phenomena behind the rapid performance loss of Fe–N–C cathodes at an early stage of PEMFC operation. A time- and potential-resolved diagnosis, enabled by the online GDE/EFC/ICP–MS system, elucidates the strong dependence of Fe leaching from active Fe–N\n4\nmoieties on operating variables, such as temperature and gas atmosphere. The former triggers Fe dissolution and determines its total amount, whereas the latter yields different fates of dissolved Fe ions. In addition, this operando study further enables differentiation of a real-time modification of SD and TOF values from the apparent ORR activity drop, a lifetime-dependent stability diagram that presents a clear shift of a prime deactivation path from SD loss to TOF decrease under realistic PEMFC operating conditions. Finally, we conclude that Fe demetallation is a crucial phenomenon responsible for the rapid performance drop observed during the first few hours of PEMFC operation. We show that prohibiting undesirable Fe demetallation and consequently enhancing PEMFC stability are synthetically available by introducing site-isolated Pt ions onto the Fe–N–C catalyst, the concept inspired by previous works and our DFT calculations. Therefore, this understanding suggests that the development of synthetic routes involving non-PGM stabilizers of Fe–N\n4\nsites could bring hope for the future reality of Fe–N–C catalysts for commercial PEMFCs.\nMethods\nCatalyst synthesis\nFe\n0.5\nNC catalyst was prepared from Fe\nII\nacetate (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen; ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Zn\nII\nzeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8, Basolite Z1200, BASF). One gram of the precursor mixture containing 0.5 wt% Fe and a mass ratio of phen/ZIF-8 of 20/80 were mixed using dry ball-milling for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm. A ZrO\n2\ncrucible with 100 ZrO\n2\nballs of 5 mm diameter was used in this procedure. The resulting precursors were pyrolysed at 1,323 K under Ar flow for 1 h. Fe\n0.5\nNC contained Fe content of ca. 1.5 wt%, as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES). For the synthesis of Fe\n0.5\nNC–Pt, 0.5 wt% Pt was impregnated on Fe\n0.5\nNC by conventional wet impregnation and subsequent H\n2\nreduction. 0.1 g Fe\n0.5\nNC was dissolved and dispersed in 100 ml of de-ionized water containing 1.3 mg of H\n2\nPtCl\n6\n·6H\n2\nO (≥37.5%, Pt basis, Merck), and then the solvent was evaporated at 353 K. The resultant powder sample was dried at 353 K under vacuum overnight and reduced at 523 K for 3 h under H\n2\nflow (5%, 200 ml min\n−1\n). Commercial Pt nanoparticle (HiSPEC 3000, 20 wt% Pt) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. For the synthesis of Fe\n2\nO\n3\n/NC, the NC catalyst was first prepared identically to Fe\n0.5\nNC, except for the addition of Fe\nII\nacetate during the ball-milling step. Note that owing to the presence of trace amounts of Fe impurities in the commercial ZIF-8 (>100 ppm) (ref.\n39\n), Fe-free ZIF-8 was used for the synthesis of NC, which was prepared by mixing 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Zn nitrate hexahydrate (Zn salt; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) in aqueous solution (Zn salt/2-MeIm/water molar ratio of 1/60/2228) (ref.\n40\n). Afterwards, Fe\n2\nO\n3\n/NC was synthesized by a dry ball-milling of 98 mg NC and 2 mg commercial Fe\n2\nO\n3\n(96%, Sigma-Aldrich) for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm without heat treatment. The Fe content in Fe\n2\nO\n3\n/NC was ca. 1.3 wt%, as confirmed by ICP–OES. Commercial Fe–N–C catalyst (no. PMF-0110904, Pajarito Powder) was purchased from Pajarito Powder Inc, which is synthesized via hard templating with fumed silica. The carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported Fe-N-C catalyst (FeNC/CNT) was synthesized using a silica-protective-layer-assisted approach\n41\n. Then 100 mg of nitric acid-treated CNTs (Carbon Nanomaterial Technology) were mixed with 200 mg of Fe\nIII\nTMPPCl (Porphyrin Systems) in an agate mortar for 5 min. The mixture was heated in a quartz-tube furnace, starting from room temperature to 673 K, at a ramping rate of 275 K min\n−1\nand kept at that temperature for 3 h under N\n2\ngas (99.999%) flowing at a rate of 1 l min\n−1\n. Afterwards, the heat-treated CNT/Fe\nIII\nTMPPCl composite was mixed with 0.5 ml of TEOS in a mortar, followed by mixing with 0.5 ml of formic acid. The resulting mixture was transferred to an alumina crucible and dried in a 333 K oven for 3 h. Subsequently, the composite was heated to 1,073 K at a ramping rate of 275 K min\n−1\nand maintained at that temperature for 3 h under N\n2\ngas flowing at a rate of 1 l min\n−1\n. To etch the silica, the resulting composite was mixed with 2:1 (v/v) solution of ethanol and 10% aqueous HF, and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was then filtered and washed with ethanol multiple times. The HF etching process was repeated following the same procedure, and the resulting sample was dried at 333 K to obtain FeNC/CNT samples.\nPhysicochemical"

In both calcination steps, the temperature rose at 10 °C min\n−\n1\nto reach the set point.

The washed K\n0.8\nTi\n1.73\nLi\n0.27\nO\n4\nlayered oxide was protonated by soaking in HCl solution (0.5 M) at room temperature for 3 days, and the solution was replaced daily with a fresh batch. To produce TiNS, the protonated titanate crystals (H\n1.0\nTi\n1.73\nO\n4\n) were dispersed in an aqueous solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) and then shaken gently for 2 days. The molar ratio between TMAOH and the protonated solid was 1:1, and the solid-to-solution ratio was controlled at 4.0 mg ml\n−\n1\n. To avoid the deleterious impact of TMAOH molecules in electrocatalytic applications, TiNS was purified by adding an appropriate amount of Mg(NO\n3\n)\n2\n(0.5 M). Then, the suspension was separated by centrifugation for 30 min at 1,610\ng\nat room temperature. The supernatant containing TMA\n+\nNO\n3\n−\nwas discarded, and TiNS was collected as a precipitate. The precipitate was re-suspended in HCl (1 M) and sonicated for 30 min, to convert residual Mg(OH)\n2\ninto MgCl\n2\nand remove it with the supernatant after centrifugation (2,862\ng\n). Finally, TiNS was dispersed in EG by a simple shaking process.\nPreparation of Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS\nTiNS loaded with Ru and Pt (denoted as Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS, respectively) were prepared by a modified polyol method. An appropriate amount of RuCl\n3\nor H\n2\nPtCl\n6\nprecursor was added to isolated TiNS to reach 25 wt.% Ru or 20 wt.% Pt. Typically, TiNS (200 mg) was first dispersed in EG (50 ml) by shaking. Then, the Ru precursor solution (103.13 mg RuCl\n3\n·\nx\nH\n2\nO dissolved in 10 ml deionized water, equivalent to 50.25 mg of Ru) was added dropwise to TiNS dispersed in EG. In the case of Pt@TiNS, the Pt precursor solution (107.92 mg H\n2\nPtCl\n6\n·6H\n2\nO dissolved in 10 ml deionized water, equivalent to 40.63 mg of Pt) was added dropwise to 200 mg TiNS dispersed in EG. The end product was heated for 3 h at 190 °C in an N\n2\nenvironment. The final step involved centrifuging Ru@TiNS or Pt@TiNS after washing them three times in acetone. For comparison, Ru (or Pt) loaded onto TiO\n2\nnanoparticles (TiO\n2\n-NP) was synthesized with the same procedure but replacing TiNS with TiO\n2\n.\nPreparation of the catalyst ink and working electrode\nTo study the electrocatalytic performance, a uniform ink dispersion was prepared by sonicating 2.0 mg of the electrocatalyst in 0.95 ml ethanol and 0.05 ml Nafion solution (5 wt.%) for 30 min, followed by stirring for 10 h. The obtained ink was sprayed onto the surface (1.5 cm\n2\n) of a clean carbon paper (CP) on a hotplate at 120 °C. The catalyst loading was accurately measured by weighting the CP with a microbalance with and without the electrocatalyst. The catalyst inks were sprayed onto one side of CP at a weight density of 1 mg cm\n−\n2\n. Considering that the electrocatalyst contained 25 wt.% of Ru or 20 wt.% of Pt, the Ru or Pt mass density was about 0.25 and 0.2 mg cm\n−\n2\n, respectively.\nPreparation of perovskite-based photocathode\nITO/glass substrates were treated with UV/ozone for 30 min and then transferred to a N\n2\n-filled glovebox with both H\n2\nO and O\n2\nlevels below 0.1 ppm. A PTAA solution (2 mg ml\n−\n1\nin toluene) was spin-cast at 4,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 100 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, a PFN-Br solution (0.5 mg ml\n−\n1\nin methanol) was deposited onto the PTAA films. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving caesium iodide (CsI; 0.06 M), formamidinium iodide (FAI; 1 M), methylammonium bromide (MABr; 0.2 M), lead iodide (PbI\n2\n; 1.1 M), lead bromide (PbBr\n2\n; 0.2 M) and oleylamine (0.1 wt.%) in 1 ml of dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvent (4/1, v/v). The perovskite layer was deposited using a two-step spin-coating procedure at 1,000 rpm for 5 s and then 5,000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 150 µl of chlorobenzene as an antisolvent was quickly dropped on the centre 10 s before the end of the whole spinning process. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The perovskite film was coated with PMMA (1 mg ml\n−\n1\nin ethyl acetate) and spun at 5,000 rpm before being heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The electron transporting layer was deposited by spin-casting a PC\n61\nBM solution (25 mg ml\n−\n1\nin chlorobenzene) at 1,000 rpm for 30 s and a BCP solution (1 mg ml\n−\n1\nin isopropyl alcohol) at 4,000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 150-nm-thick Ag electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation at <10\n−\n6\nTorr. Ru@TiNS was sprayed on a piece of CP. After drying, the Ru@TiNS loaded on CP was connected to the Ni foil (0.6 cm × 0.6 cm, thickness ~0.1 mm, Alfa Aesar) with the silver (Ag) paste. This configuration was then attached to the Ag layer (top electrode of the perovskite solar cell) using FM, where it was melted at its melting point (62 °C), followed by cooling to room temperature according to a previous report\n28\n. The edges were then covered with epoxy resin. Finally, to complete the fabrication, small, enamelled piece of copper wire was connected to the samples via Ag paste, leaving them for at least 24 h to dry completely.\nElectrochemical nitrate reduction (NITRR)\nAll NITRR experiments were performed in a three-electrode H-cell configuration, with constant stirring at 500 rpm in both compartments. CP with sprayed catalyst ink was used as the working electrode; Hg/HgO or Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in alkaline or acidic medium, respectively; and a piece of clean Pt wire as the CE. The applied potential was expressed relative to the RHE using the following equation for conversion:\n$$E,{V}_{{{\\mathrm{RHE}}}}=E,{V}_{\\frac{{{\\mathrm{Hg}}}}{{{\\mathrm{HgO}}}}}\\left({{\\mathrm{or}}\\; E},{V}_{\\frac{{{\\mathrm{Ag}}}}{{{\\mathrm{AgCl}}}}}\\right)+0.59\\,{{\\mathrm{pH}}}.$$\n(2)\nThe two compartments in the H-cell were separated by a Nafion membrane. The concentrations of NH\n3\nand NO\n2\n−\nwere measured periodically in the anolyte part to check product diffusion from the catholyte to the anolyte cell. When needed, a replenishment system was utilized to supply fresh NO\n3\n−\nelectrolyte solution in the catholyte compartment. In the experiments, the H-cell was filled with 50 ml electrolyte solution in each half, and the system was connected online to the gas chromatograph to analyse the HER. It was also equipped with a sealed syringe to enable online sampling and measurement of NH\n3\nand NO\n2\n−\nconcentrations (using the indophenol blue and Griess reagent protocols, respectively; Supplementary Fig.\n6\n). The FE for NH\n3\nand NO\n2\n−\nand the current density for NH\n3\nwere calculated as follows:\n$${{{\\mathrm{FE}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{NH}}}3}=\\frac{\\left(8\\times F\\times {C}_{{{\\mathrm{NH}}}3}\\times V\\,\\right)}{Q}$$\n(3)\n$${{{\\mathrm{FE}}}}_{{{\\mathrm{NO}}}2}=\\frac{\\left(2\\times F\\times {C}_{{{\\mathrm{NO}}}2}\\times V\\,\\right)}{Q}$$\n(4)\n$${{{\\mathrm{FE}}}}_{{\\mathrm{H}}2}=\\frac{\\left(2\\times F\\times {C}_{{\\mathrm{H}}2}\\times V\\,\\right)}{Q}$$\n(5)\nwhere\nF\nis the Faraday constant,\nV\nis the volume of the electrolyte,\nQ\nis the transferred charge in the electrocatalytic reaction,\nC\nNH3\nand\nC\nNO2\nare respectively the molar concentrations of NH\n3\nand nitrite,\nm\nis the catalyst mass and\nt\nis the reaction time. Furthermore, the onset potential, which we define here to mean to the voltage at which 0.5 mA cm\n−\n2\nis reached.\nElectrochemical glycerol oxidation\nIn the electrochemical glycerol oxidation experiment, Pt@TiNS sprayed on CP (loading: 1 mg cm\n−\n2\n) was used as the working electrode, Pt wire as the CE, and Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. A two-compartment cell was filled with 50 ml of 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M glycerol as electrolyte on each side. The product concentration and selectivity were measured by a Waters 2535 high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with UV and refractive index detectors and a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H sugar column.\nPEC measurement\nPEC measurements were performed on each individual photocathode utilizing a half-cell reactor in 1.0 M KOH with various KNO\n3\nconcentrations in a conventional three-electrode system. The working, reference and counter electrodes were integrated perovskite photocathode, Hg/HgO (1.0 M NaOH), and Pt mesh (1 cm × 1 cm). All potentials were measured against the Hg/HgO reference electrode and converted to the RHE reference scale using the equation\nE\n(\nV\nversus RHE) =\nE\n(\nV\nversus Hg/HgO) + 0.059 × pH + 0.118. For the unassisted measurement system, PEC tests were performed to reveal the long-term stability and concentration of formed products using 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M KNO\n3\n(50 ml) as the catholyte and 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M glycerol (50 ml) as the anolyte. The home-made glass reactor was used to conduct the unassisted experiments. A Nafion 117 membrane that had been pre-activated by soaking in deionized water for 2 h divided this two-compartment reactor in the middle. The geometric area of the photocathodes was used to normalize all current densities, and a 10 mV s\n−\n1\nscan rate was maintained. The simulated AM 1.5 G one-sun irradiation was achieved by using a water filter and a 300 W xenon lamp. By aligning a silicon reference cell (approved by Newport Corporation; PEC-SI01, Peccell Technologies) parallel to the light beam from the xenon lamp, the light intensity was adjusted on the ITO side (backside illumination) to one sun. The device was covered by black tape except for an aperture area of 0.096 cm\n2\n, which determined the illumination area. The absorbance measurements were conducted on a UV–Vis spectrometer (Agilent Cary 5000). The thickness of the PMMA layer was measured by first depositing the layer on thin ITO glass and then conducting ellipsometry (Elli-SE-UaM8).\nIndophenol blue method\nUV–Vis spectroscopy was utilized to measure NH\n3\nconcentration by the indophenol blue method\n29\n,\n37\n,\n46\n. The samples were collected through the gas-sealed syringe line and diluted enough to be within detectable range. Then, into 1 ml mixed solution containing 1 M NaOH, 5 wt.% salicylic acid and 5 wt.% sodium citrate, 1 ml of diluted sample was added. In the next step, 0.5 ml NaClO (0.05 M) was added and mixed by pipetting method. Finally, 0.1 ml sodium nitroferricyanide solution (1.0 wt.%) was added, mixed and kept for 1 h under dark before UV–Vis spectrophotometry measurement. The peak absorbance at 655 nm was recorded, and the NH\n3\nconcentration was calculated by calibration curve obtained using NH\n4\nCl solutions (Supplementary Fig.\n6a,b\n).\nThe NH\n3\nconcentration was also measured by\n1\nH-NMR (500 MHz) according to a previous reported procedure\n46\n. The sample was diluted to the detection range and mixed with 0.1 ml DMSO, and its NMR spectrum was acquired on a Liquid Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer. The NH\n3\nconcentration was evaluated using a standard calibration curve (Supplementary Fig.\n7\n).\nNitrite detection\nThe nitrite concentration was measured using a spectroscopy procedure reported elsewhere\n29\n.\np\n-Aminobenzenesulfonamide (2.0 g) was dissolved in 50 ml deionized water. Another solution was prepared by mixing ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.1 g) and phosphoric acid (3.94 ml) in 50 ml deionized water. Both solutions were stored in the refrigerator and mixed in 1:1 volume ratio (colouring agent) just before the UV–Vis measurement. Then, 1.0 ml of the collected sample was diluted to reach the detection range, and 2.0 ml H\n2\nSO\n4\n(0.5 M) was added and finally 1.0 ml of the above prepared colouring agent. By using UV–Vis spectrophotometry, the intensity of the spectral peak at 540 nm was determined (UV-2600). A calibration curve was used to determine the concentration (Supplementary Fig.\n6c,d\n).\nIsotopically labelled ammonia (\n15\nNH\n3\n) detection\nTo exclude the possibility of NH\n3\ndetection by another source of contaminations (N\n2\nreduction reaction, electrode contamination or NH\n3\ninjection through gas line or in air) isotopically labelled K\n15\nNO\n3\n(Sigma-Aldrich, 98 atom%\n15\nN) was utilized as N-source and the corresponding\n15\nNH\n3\n+\nwas quantified by\n15\nNH\n3\n+\n(Agilent (Varian) VNMRS-600MHz spectrometer). Due to the clear identification of\n15\nNH\n3\n+\nwith doublet\n15\nNH\n3\n+\nfrom triplet peaks of\n14\nNH\n3\n+\n, overestimation of NH\n3\nconcentration and consequently FE, percentage can be cancelled effectively. Isotopically labelled experiments were conducted for both electrocatalytic and PEC conversion of K\n15\nNO\n3\nto\n15\nNH\n4\n+\n. The sample was taken from electrolyte at different time after starting reaction and then acidified to pH 3 by adding appropriate 3 M HCl. The sample then mixed with 0.1 ml DMSO, and its\n1\nH-NMR spectrum was obtained. The\n15\nNH\n4\n+\nconcentration was quantified based on the calibration curve acquired by a set of\n15\nNH\n4\nCl (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 atom%\n15\nN) standard solutions (Supplementary Fig.\n9\n).\nAnolyte product quantification\nA certain amount of aliquot was analysed after each experiment using HPLC to calculate selectivity of the products via an Agilent 1260 infinity 2 chromatography equipped with a Hi-Plex H (7.7 × 300 mm, 8 μm) column. The selectivity of products was calculated by the following equation:\n$${{\\mathrm{Selectivity}}}=\\frac{{N}_{{\\mathrm{D}}}}{{N}_{{\\mathrm{T}}}}\\times 100$$\n(6)\n$${\\rm{Yield}}, \\% =\\frac{{N}_{{\\mathrm{D}}}}{{a\\times N}_{{\\mathrm{i}}}}\\times 100$$\n(7)\nwhere\nN\nT\nis the total sum of desired and undesired products,\nN\ni\nis the initial concentration of glycerol and\nN\nD\nis the desired product. For its quantification, the standard calibration curve was plotted on the basis of the concentration and integrated area in HPLC. Here the solvent for standard solution was H\n2\nSO\n4\nwith proper concentration recommended for column."

After rinsing with deionized water and ethanol three times, the powder was dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and then calcined in argon at 600 °C for 2 h (heating rate, 2 °C min\n−1\n). A light grey powder was obtained and named as Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-SS (Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-4:1). The preparation methods of Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-9:1, Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-2:1, Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-1:1, Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-1:2, Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-1:4 and Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-1:9 electrocatalysts are similar to those of Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-SS, and the feeding ratios of Cu(CH\n3\nCOO)\n2\nto Pr(CH\n3\nCOO)\n3\n·6H\n2\nO, and (NH\n4\n)\n2\nCO\n3\nwere changed to (mmol) 1:9:4, 1:2:2.5, 1:1:2.5, 2:1:4, 4:1:8 and 9:1:18, respectively.\nSynthesis of the Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-CS and Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-SC catalysts\nThe Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-CS catalyst was synthesized by a co-precipitation and stepwise calcination method. First, Cu(CH\n3\nCOO)\n2\n(1 mmol) and Pr(CH\n3\nCOO)\n3\n·6H\n2\nO (4 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of 100 ml deionized water and ethanol (3:7 vol/vol) by an ultrasonic device, and then heated to 50 °C with vigorous stirring. A mixture of (NH\n4\n)\n2\nCO\n3\n(3 mmol) and KOH (10 mmol) was dissolved in 15 ml deionized water to form a co-precipitating agent, which was then slowly dropped into the previously prepared mixed solvent containing the precursor, and stirred for 30 min. Then the temperature was raised to 85 °C stirring continued for 2 h. The mixture was evaporated using a rotary evaporator and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. After grinding the solid with an agate mortar, the powder was calcined under air at 500 °C for 3 h (heating rate, 10 °C min\n−1\n). After rinsing with deionized water and ethanol three times, the powder was dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and then calcined in argon at 600 °C for 2 h (heating rate, 2 °C min\n−1\n). A light grey powder was obtained and named Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-CS. The Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-SC catalyst was synthesized by a stepwise precipitation and co-calcination method. The preparation method was similar to that of Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-SS, with the only difference being that the temperature of the first calcination process was raised to 600 °C, discarding the second calcination process in argon. A light brown powder was obtained and named Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-SC.\nSynthesis of the CuO and Pr\n6\nO\n11\ncatalysts\nCuO and Pr\n6\nO\n11\ncatalysts were prepared following similar synthetic procedures as those for Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-SS catalyst, while 4 mmol Cu(CH\n3\nCOO)\n2\nand 8 mmol KOH were used instead in preparation of CuO. Pr\n6\nO\n11\ncatalyst was prepared with 4 mmol Pr(CH\n3\nCOO)\n3\n·6H\n2\nO and 10 mmol (NH\n4\n)\n2\nCO\n3\nwere used.\nSynthesis of the RO\nx\n–Cu catalysts\nRO\nx\n–Cu catalysts (R = La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, Gd and Er) were prepared following the similar synthetic procedures to those for Pr\n6\nO\n11\n–Cu-SS catalysts; the amounts of starting precursors used are listed in Supplementary Table\n2\n."

The products were then collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water until the supernatant solution was neutral. After freeze-drying for 2 days, 0.15 g of the sample was treated in a tube furnace with 5 vol% H\n2\n/Ar gas at 150 °C for 5 h to introduce defects. The resulting sample was named BWO. Palladium single-atom loading was performed by a typical incipient wet-impregnation method: to prepare 0.05 wt% Pd–O\n3\n/BWO, 50 mg of BWO nanosheet was impregnated with 100 μl of 0.25 mg Pd ml\n−1\nPdCl\n2\n/acetonitrile solution. After impregnation, the sample was dried at 60 °C for 30 min and then calcinated in a muffle furnace at 175 °C for 3 h. The impregnation step remained the same for preparing 0.05 wt% Pd–O\n4\n/BWO, apart from changing the calcination temperature to 250 °C. Palladium nanoparticle loading was followed by thermal reduction: for the preparation of 0.5 wt% Pd\nNp\n/BWO, 100 mg BWO, 7.5 mg ascorbic acid, 7.5 mg citric acid and 25 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (mol. wt, 55,000) were added to 9 ml deionized water at 80 °C under vigorous stirring. After 30 min, 1.85 ml of 1 mg ml\n−1\nK\n2\nPdCl\n6\nsolution was injected into the solution dropwise and kept stirring for 4 h. Finally, the solid was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C overnight, after which the supernatant was almost transparent, indicating the successful loading of palladium nanoparticles on the support.\nCatalytic evaluation\nSingle-batch reaction system\nTypically, 5 mg photocatalysts and 0.1 mmol toluene were dispersed in 2 ml acetonitrile and transferred into a 10-ml quartz tube with continuous stirring. Then, O\n2\nwas steadily bubbled through the solution. The photocatalytic reactions were performed on a WATTCAS Parallel Light Reactor (WP-TEC-1020HSL), using an 8-W, 400–405-nm purple LED, which was integrated with a water circulation system that maintained the temperature constant at 25 °C (room temperature). The light power density was measured through direct contact with the light source by an optical power and energy meter (Thorlabs-PM 100D) as 130 mW cm\n−\n2\n. After irradiation for a specified time, the mixture was collected and the photocatalysts were separated by centrifugation. The obtained supernatant was detected and quantitatively analysed by GC–MS with an electron capture detector (Thermo Trace GC Ultra) and GC with a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC 2010 Plus).\nFlow reaction system\nGenerally, 37.5 mg photocatalysts and 0.75 mmol toluene were thoroughly dispersed in 15 ml acetonitrile by sonication. Then, the mixture was transferred to a vessel with continuous stirring and water cooling to guarantee a constant room temperature (25 °C). Subsequently, the mixture was pumped into the photochemical flow reaction reactor (9 ml liquid hold-up volume) via a peristaltic pump. Meanwhile, the compressed air was introduced and controlled by a flow meter to form monodispersed bubbles in the reactor channels. After the specified reaction time, the mixture was collected and centrifuged, and the contents finally detected and analysed.\nThe flow reaction device is fitted with a 405-nm LED panel as the light source. This panel was clamped to the device and its light power density was measured through direct contact with the light source by an optical power and energy meter (Thorlabs-PM 100D) as 120 mW cm\n−\n2\n."

Three long-term degradation cycles were conducted daily. When the catalyst became deactivated, it was washed with ethanol and reused for pollutant degradation.\nMeasurement of CODs for catalyst and reaction solution\nFor measuring the COD of the solution, 3 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and filtered, and 2 ml of the filtrate was used as the sample.

With increasing molar percentage of Ni from 0 mol% to 100 mol%, a structural reversal of the metallic species (or oxides) from small nanoparticles to a continuous phase occurs (Supplementary Figs.\n5\nand\n6\nand Supplementary Table\n2\n). Interestingly, the space–time yield (STY) of CH\n4\nin the kinetic region for Ni–ZrO\n2\nsamples at 200 °C shows a double volcano-shaped dependence on the molar ratio of oxide in the catalyst. The two local maxima appear at 13 mol% ZrO\n2\n/Ni (87 mol% Ni/ZrO\n2\n) and 30 mol% Ni/ZrO\n2\n, respectively. The CH\n4\nSTY of the 13 mol% ZrO\n2\n/Ni inverse catalyst reaches 16.9 mmol CH\n4\ng\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\n, much higher than the 5.3 mmol CH\n4\ng\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\nfor the 30 mol% Ni/ZrO\n2\nconventional catalyst. Unlike in the widely reported conventional oxide-supported Ni catalysts (with a molar percentage of Ni ranging from approximately 10% to 40%), a second maximum is rarely observed; this is attributed to the formation of the inverse interfacial structure\n29\n,\n30\n.\nThe catalytic CO\n2\nmethanation performance was compared further for a series of inverse catalysts and conventional Ni/oxide catalysts of the same compositions. The 13 mol% ZrO\n2\n/Ni inverse catalyst realized 88.2% CO\n2\nconversion with >99.9% methane selectivity at 240 °C (Fig.\n1b\nand Supplementary Fig.\n7a\n). In contrast, the CO\n2\nconversion was only 19.8% for a conventional 30 mol% Ni/ZrO\n2\ncatalyst. Apart from ZrO\n2\n/Ni catalysts, the advantages of inverse configuration were also observed for other reducible and nonreducible oxides constructed as inverse catalysts, such as CeO\n2\n/Ni, MgO/Ni and SiO\n2\n/Ni (Fig.\n1c–e\n, Supplementary Figs.\n7b–d\nand\n8\nand Supplementary Table\n3\n). The enhanced CO\n2\nadsorption capacities of these inverse catalysts compared with conventional catalysts is one possible reason for the observed performance improvements (Supplementary Fig.\n9\n).\nAs CeO\n2\nand ZrO\n2\nparticles present relatively good CO\n2\nmethanation activity, the mixed oxide strategy is used further to engineer the interfacial structure. CO\n2\n-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) studies revealed that the formation of mixed oxide on Ni support further enhanced the CO\n2\nactivation capacity (Supplementary Fig.\n9\n). Compared with other state-of-the-art Ni-based CO\n2\nmethanation catalysts\n31\n,\n32\n,\n33\n,\n34\n, the diluted 13 mol% CeZrO\nx\n/Ni inverse catalyst exhibited high low-temperature CO\n2\nmethanation activity, which increased strongly at 160 °C and achieved ~40% CO\n2\nconversion and >99% CH\n4\nselectivity at 180 °C under a WHSV of 15,000 mL g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\nat atmospheric pressure (Fig.\n2a\nand Supplementary Fig.\n10a\n); the CO\n2\nconversion was ~90% at 200 °C. In comparison, a widely recognized low-temperature CO\n2\nmethanation catalyst, 10 mol% Ru/TiO\n2\n(refs.\n31\n,\n32\n,\n33\n,\n34\n), required temperatures of ~280 °C to obtain 44% CO\n2\nconversion under similar conditions. In addition, the 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO\nx\ncatalyst was almost inactive below 240 °C, which further highlights the importance of the inverse configuration for low-temperature CO\n2\nmethanation. As the metallic Ni NPs showed poor activity in the CO\n2\nhydrogenation reaction, it is clear that the combination of a continuous phase of metallic Ni, with dispersed nano-oxides, are a key factor that controls the activity of the inverse catalysts.\nFig. 2: The catalytic performance of CeZrO\nx\n/Ni inverse catalysts.\na\n, Temperature-dependent activities of the 13 mol% CeZrO\nx\n/Ni, 13 mol% ZrO\n2\n/Ni, 13 mol% CeO\n2\n/Ni, 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO\nx\n(15 wt% Ni/ CeZrO\nx\n) and Ni catalysts.\nb\n, STY of CH\n4\nof 13 mol% CeZrO\nx\n/Ni catalyst under different pressures at a setting temperature of 180 °C; the bed temperature is displayed accordingly.\nc\n, CH\n4\n-based apparent activation energy (\nE\na\n) of 13 mol% CeZrO\nx\n/Ni, 13 mol% ZrO\n2\n/Ni, 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO\nx\nand 30 mol% Ni/ZrO\n2\ncatalysts (hot spots are minimized by inert SiC dilution).\nd\n, CO\n2\nconversion and CH\n4\n/CO selectivity along with the time on stream over the undiluted 13 mol% CeZrO\nx\n/Ni catalyst under a WHSV of 60,000 ml g\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\nwith a ratio of H\n2\n/CO\n2\nof 4:1, and temperature varying from room temperature to 180 °C to 450 °C.

In addition, the CO\n2\nconversion increased to 93% when the pressure was increased to 20 bar at 180 °C (Fig.\n2b\n). This finding is comparable with that of the RuO\n2\n/C catalyst\n4\n, which was reported recently as the most competitive low temperature methanation catalyst at 180 °C (work at 20 bar, 110 mmol CH\n4\ng\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\nat 50% CO\n2\nconversion); the CH\n4\nSTY of the CeZrO\nx\n/Ni inverse catalyst was 137 mmol CH\n4\ng\ncat\n−1\nh\n−1\nunder the same reaction conditions (Supplementary Fig.\n10c\n). The conversion-STY\nCH4\nprofiles of literature-reported Ni- and Ru-based catalysts at 200 °C are summarized (Supplementary Table\n4\n); the mass specific activity of 13 mol% CeZrO\nx\n/Ni catalyst is competitive. The intrinsic catalytic activities with inert dilution were also used to calculate the CH\n4\n-based apparent activation energy (\nE\na-CH4\n) (Fig.\n2c\nand Supplementary Fig.\n11\n); that of 13 mol% CeZrO\nx\n/Ni is 66.5 kJ mol\n−1\n, which is lower than that of 13 mol% ZrO\n2\n/Ni (74.4 kJ mol\n−1\n) and much lower than that of conventional 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO\nx\n(96.2 kJ mol\n−1\n) and 30 mol% Ni/ZrO\n2\ncatalysts (94.4 kJ mol\n−1\n), indicating the promise of the Ni-supported nano-oxide inverse configuration for CO\n2\nmethanation.\nUsually, supported Ni catalysts are prone to deactivate under harsh reaction conditions such as overheating and start–stop cycles in CO\n2\nmethanation owing to the strong tendency of sintering, leaching via Ni(CO)\n4\nand coke deposition\n35\n,\n36\n. The undiluted 13 mol% CeZrO\nx\n/Ni inverse catalyst was used to investigate stability in the intensely exothermic reaction. The 13 mol% CeZrO\nx\n/Ni catalyst exhibited high CO\n2\nhydrogenation stability in a long-term stability test, including 350 h of temperature cycling and start–stop cycling tests (Fig.\n2d\nand Supplementary Table\n5\n) and 400 h of uninterrupted testing (Supplementary Fig.\n12a\n), which offers a potential solution for coupling in unsteady renewable hydrogen systems. Even if the catalyst experienced a 450 °C thermal shock, the initial activity can be restored when the operating temperature drops back to 180 °C. It is worth noting that the heat released by methanation reaction promotes the reaction, and in the long-term stability test at 180 °C, the bed temperature remained stable at 199.3 °C (Supplementary Fig.\n12b\n). Moreover, when introducing additional 40–50 vol% steam in the gas feed at varied temperatures (180–450 °C), the activity and selectivity recovered after removing the steam (Supplementary Fig.\n13\n). Typically, 5–10 vol% water is introduced to test water resistance of catalysts\n37\n,\n38\n; the test result under 40–50 vol% water demonstrated that the 13 mol% CeZrO\nx\n/Ni catalyst also realized high water resistance. In summary, the MO\nx\n/Ni inverse configuration was demonstrated to be a highly active and selective interfacial structure for the low-temperature CO\n2\nmethanation reaction. CeZrO\nx\n/Ni is the most active combination among the studied inverse catalysts. Its high activity, long-term stability and high tolerance to unsteady operation and other harsh conditions showcase its potential for further applications.\nStructural"

The pH value of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 51 μmol H\n2\nPtCl\n6\nand 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. With the slurry magnetically stirred for 5 h, the platinum-containing precursor solution was slowly added into the CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\nslurry. After stirring for another 2 h, the mixture was separated by vacuum filtration to give platinum-containing solid particles, which were then washed several times with deionized water. The resultant powder was calcined at 600 °C for 12 h to form the as-synthesized catalyst. Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\nwas reduced in flowing 10% H\n2\n/helium at 400 °C for 1 h to produce the Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-RED samples containing platinum clusters. To prepare the oxidized sample (Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-OX), the reduced Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-RED sample was recalcined in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 2 h.\nThe 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\nsample was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\nin 120 ml deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 26 μmol H\n2\nPtCl\n6\nand 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. The adsorption, calcination and reduction steps were the same as those stated above to produce the as-synthesized 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\ncatalyst and 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-RED samples containing platinum clusters. The 0.8 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\nsample was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg as-synthesized Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n(0.5 wt%, calcined at 500 °C for 12 h) in 120 ml deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 26 μmol H\n2\nPtCl\n6\nand 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water. The adsorption, calcination and reduction were done as stated above to produce the as-synthesized 0.8 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\ncatalyst and 0.8 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-RED samples containing platinum clusters. The 1.2 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\nsample was prepared by first dispersing 500 mg as-synthesized Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n(0.5 wt%, calcined at 500 °C for 12 h) in 120 ml deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted by adding HCl (0.15 mmol); separately, 51 μmol H\n2\nPtCl\n6\nand 0.075 mmol HCl were added in 50 ml deionized water.

Conventional data were collected at beamline 4-1; this is a side station on a 20-pole wiggler beamline. The ring (SPEAR3) was operated in the top-off mode; the storage ring energy was 3 GeV and the stored current was 500 mA. To minimize harmonics at the platinum L\n3\nedge, the double-crystal Si(220) monochromator was detuned by 20%–30% of the maximum intensity. Ex situ spectra were collected in the fluorescence yield mode with a 30-element germanium solid-state detector array. The samples were pressed into pellets and mounted on a plate, and the data were recorded at room temperature. In operando XAS experiments were done with approximately 40 mg samples loaded in a tubular flow-through quartz cell (inside diameter, 2.8 mm) through which the treatment gases flowed\n24\n.\nHERFD-XANES experiments were performed at beamline 15-2, which is equipped with a 56-pole, 0.9 T wiggler and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled double-crystal Si(311) monochromator for selection of the incident-beam energy. A Rowland circle spectrometer having a radius of 1 m and equipped with three spherically bent Si(800) analyzers and a silicon drift detector were used to select the platinum L\nα\nemission line\n50\n. In each HERFD-XANES experiment, an approximately 40 mg sample was loaded in the flow-through cell that was fed with the treatment gas.\nATHENA and ARTEMIS software\n51\nwere used to analyze the EXAFS data. Data alignment, edge calibration, deglitching, normalization and background subtraction were performed with ATHENA. The platinum L\n3\nedge energy was determined by the first inflection point of the absorption edge data characterizing a platinum-foil reference, calibrated to the reported energy of 11,564.0 eV. Data fitting was performed considering\nk\n1\n,\nk\n2\nand\nk\n3\nweightings. The fitting ranges in\nk\nspace and\nR\nspace in the data analysis for each sample were determined by the data quality. These values were used with the Nyquist theorem for the estimation of the justified number of fitting parameters, which was not exceeded in the reported fits. The amplitude reduction factor,\nS\n0\n2\n, was determined by fitting the experimental platinum-foil data, and then fixed for further analysis of the data characterizing the various samples (Supplementary Fig.\n5\nand Supplementary Table\n1\n). The parameters characterizing the local structure environment including the CN, scattering path distance between the absorber and backscattering atoms (\nR\n), mean square relative displacement (Δ\nσ\n2\n, disorder term) and inner potential correction (Δ\nE\n0\n) were allowed to vary in the fitting. Various plausible models were considered in the fitting. The quality of fit was determined by the minimization of the R factor.\nStandard procedures were used in the analysis of the XANES data\n51\n.\nSTEM\nHAADF-STEM imaging was performed with an aberration-corrected JEOL ARM-200F microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and an image resolution of 0.08 nm in the HAADF imaging mode and, separately, with a double-aberration-corrected Themis Z microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV and an image resolution of 0.06 nm. The catalyst powders were loaded on lacey-carbon-coated copper transmission electron microscopy grids, and low electron probe currents were used to reduce the electron-beam-induced effects.\nInfrared spectroscopy\nA Bruker IFS 66v spectrometer (equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT) detector) and a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT-A) detector) were used to collect the DRIFTS data characterizing the powder samples. The spectral resolution was 4 cm\n−1\n. The cell was partly filled with approximately 50 mg of inert KBr powder, followed by adding approximately 10 mg of catalyst packed onto the KBr. The cell was connected into a flow system that allowed the recording of spectra as the reactant gases (CO (10% in helium, Airgas), helium (Praxair, UHP grade),\n13\nCO (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 99.5%), ethylene (Airgas, UHP grade) and/or H\n2\n(Airgas, UHP grade)) flowed through the cell at the desired temperature. The background spectra were recorded at room temperature for the as-synthesized Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\nand Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-OX samples in the presence of flowing helium (40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n). CO adsorption was conducted by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\nof 10% CO/helium for 30 min. The CO desorption spectra were recorded following a helium purge at a flow rate of 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\nto remove gas-phase CO from the cell. To prepare and characterize the reduced catalyst, namely, Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-RED, H\n2\nreduction treatments were conducted with the sample in the cell before CO adsorption. The cell was heated in 10% H\n2\n/helium flowing at 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\nas the temperature was ramped from room temperature to 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C min\n–1\nfollowed by a dwell time of 1 h at 400 °C. Then, the cell was cooled to room temperature, and the gas feed was switched to a helium flow at 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n. The background spectra were recorded at room temperature with the sample in helium flowing at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n. Thereafter, CO adsorption experiments were conducted by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\nof 10% CO/helium for 30 min. The CO desorption spectra were recorded during a helium purge at a flow rate of 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n.\nIn\n13\nCO adsorption experiments, the background spectra were recorded at room temperature with helium flowing through the cell at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n.\n13\nCO adsorption was conducted by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\nof 25%\n13\nCO/helium for 20 min.\n13\nCO desorption spectra were recorded during the flow of helium purge gas at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n; this treatment removed gas-phase\n13\nCO from the cell.\nTo characterize the performance of the used Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\nsample, the catalytic reaction was carried out with the sample in the DRIFTS cell in a mixture of H\n2\nflowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n+ ethylene flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n+ helium flowing at 32 ml (NTP) min\n–1\nat 70 °C; the pressure was atmospheric, and the run continued for 176 h. Then, the cell was cooled to room temperature, and the gas feed was switched to helium flowing at 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n. The background spectra were recorded at room temperature with helium flowing through the cell at a rate of 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n. Thereafter, CO adsorption was investigated by flowing 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\nof 10% CO/helium for 30 min. CO desorption spectra were recorded during a helium purge at a flow rate of 40 ml (NTP) min\n–1\nto remove gas-phase CO from the cell.\nInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry\nThe platinum loading of each catalyst sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, performed using a Thermo Scientific XSERIES 2 instrument.\nXPS measurements\nThe XPS measurements were performed with a K-Alpha Plus XPS/UPS analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1,486.6 eV) with the samples placed in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber. The system reached a stable pressure, typically in the mid 10\n−10\ntorr range, after ~12 h without the sample, or in the 10\n−8\ntorr range with the sample present. Samples were mounted on conductive silver tape. A vacuum transfer module was used to transfer samples directly from a glove box to the XPS chamber without air exposure. A flood gun was used during the measurements to dynamically compensate for sample charging. A step size of 0.1 eV and a pass energy of 50 eV were used for each spectrum. The spectra were calibrated by setting the Si 2\np\nsignal of SiO\n2\nto 103.4 eV (ref.\n52\n). CasaXPS software version 2.3.25 was used for further data calibration and processing.\nXRD crystallography\nXRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a Philips X’Pert Pro Super diffractometer, equipped with a monochromatized Cu Kα radiation source at a wavelength of 0.1542 nm.\nEthylene hydrogenation catalysis in a conventional flow reactor\nEthylene hydrogenation catalysis experiments were done with a once-through temperature-controlled tubular plug-flow reactor (inside diameter, 4 mm) at various temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The products were analyzed with an online Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 50 m × 0.53 mm PLOT Alumina ‘M’ capillary column. Samples of the catalyst (Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\nand Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-RED) powder (12 mg) mixed with 500 mg of inert non-porous α-Al\n2\nO\n3\nparticles were loaded into the reactor, with the upstream and downstream sections packed with quartz wool. The catalyst masses were 12 mg and 6 mg for 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-RED and 1.2 wt% Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-RED, respectively, and the catalyst powders were mixed with 500 mg of inert non-porous α-Al\n2\nO\n3\npowders. In these catalysis experiments, the feed was a mixture of H\n2\nflowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n+ ethylene flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n+ helium flowing at 32 ml (NTP) min\n–1\n. The values of near-steady-state TOF were determined directly from the conversions of ethylene, which were <5.0% and shown to be differential\n53\n. After each catalyst reached steady-state operation, no substantial deactivation was observed at longer times on stream (176 h). Thereafter, the catalytic reaction experiments were carried out at various temperatures with the same feed gas to provide near-steady-state conversions at various temperatures. Each reported catalytic reaction rate (TOF) at each temperature is based on data from approximately 8 h of near-steady-state operation.\nn\n-Hexadecane hydrocracking\nn\n-Hexadecane hydrocracking was carried out in a stirred 50 ml Hastelloy slurry reactor at 260 °C for 6 h. In a typical test, the reactor was flushed with H\n2\nten times to remove any residual air after the addition of 200 mg of catalyst (100 mg Pt/CeO\nx\n/SiO\n2\n-RED + 100 mg HY zeolite (Si:Al = 40, atomic)) and 2.00 g of\nn\n-hexadecane. HY zeolite was pretreated by calcination at 500 °C for 5 h. The reactor was pressurized with 3.0 MPa of H\n2\nat room temperature and heated and held at 260 °C for 6 h. The gas phase and products dissolved in\nn\n-hexadecane were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-2014).\nComputational methods\nSpin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package code at the generalized gradient approximation level within the projector augmented wave/Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof formalism\n54\n,\n55\n. Hubbard\nU\n(\nU\neff\n= 5.0 eV) with effective on-site Coulomb interaction correction was used for the strongly correlated 4\nf\nelectrons of cerium\n56\n. A CeO\n2\n(111) slab model (11.5 Å × 13.3 Å) with three triatomic layers was adopted to investigate the evolution of interfacial structures from that incorporating isolated single Pt\n1\nO\nx\nspecies to Pt\nn\nclusters. The total energy calculations were performed using a 2 × 2 × 1 grid and a plane-wave cut-off energy of 400 eV. A vacuum space greater than 15 Å was added in the\nz\ndirection to avoid interaction with each slab. Atoms in the bottom triatomic layer of a catalyst model were fixed, and all the other atoms, including adsorbates, were allowed to relax until the force on each ion was less than 0.02 eV Å\n–1\n. The cohesive energy (\nE\ncoh\n) is defined as\nE\ncoh\n=\nE\nclusters+slab\n–\nE\nslab\n–\nn\n*\nE\nPt1\n, where\nE\nclusters+slab\n,\nE\nslab\n,\nn\nand\nE\nPt1\nare the Gibbs free energy of optimized Pt\nn\n/CeO\n2\n(111) and Gibbs free energy of optimized CeO\n2\n(111), the nuclearity of the platinum clusters and the energy of an isolated single platinum atom, respectively. To check the stability of the candidate cluster structures under the experimental conditions, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed. The selected structures after the standard structure optimization calculations were used to run the AIMD simulations for a period of 3 ps at 400 °C by setting the canonical ensemble (\nNVT\n) with a Nose–Hoover thermostat. Then, the generated configurations were further optimized using standard DFT calculations to demonstrate the stability. The optimal adsorption configurations of the reactants (C\n2\nH\n4\nand H\n2\n) on the selective Pt\n1\nO\n5\nH and Pt\nn\nclusters were searched. The adsorption energy (\nE\nads\n) is defined as\nE\nads\n=\nE\nadsorb/surf\n–\nE\nsurf\n–\nE\nadsorb\n, where\nE\nadsorb/surf\n,\nE\nsurf\nand\nE\nadsorb\nrepresent the total energies of the slab with adsorbate(s), the clean slab and the isolated adsorbate, respectively. For each elementary step in C\n2\nH\n4\nhydrogenation, the initial and final states were first optimized. The transition states were then searched using both the climbing image nudged elastic band method and the complete linear/quadratic synchronous transit method\n57\n,\n58\n. The accuracy of the transition states was confirmed by analyzing the vibrational frequencies. The Gibbs free energy change is defined as Δ\nG\n= Δ\nE\n+ ΔZPE –\nT\nΔ\nS\n, where Δ\nE\nis obtained from DFT calculations and ΔZPE is the correction in zero-point energies. All the atomic coordinates of the optimized models including the single atoms, platinum clusters, AIMD stability, hydrogenation pathways and side-reaction steps are provided in Supplementary Data\n1\n–\n5\n."
