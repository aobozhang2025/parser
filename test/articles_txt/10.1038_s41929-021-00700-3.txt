Heterogeneous catalysis
Two-dimensional materials
Abstract
Single-atom catalysis is recognized as a frontier of heterogeneous catalysis for its efficient utilization of metals and the possibility to engender unusual reactivity. Yet, despite the observation of single atoms, understanding their coordination structures and developing structure–property relationships remains challenging due to the structural complexity of support surfaces. Here, using single-crystalline MgO(111) two-dimensional nanosheets and a surface organometallic chemistry method, we describe the formation of highly dispersed Ir(III) sites (isolated at 0.1 wt%, and Ir pairs and trimers at 1 wt%) with well-defined coordination structures. These species display unique catalytic properties in the coupling reaction of benzene and ethylene to form styrene, a reactivity that contrasts with conventional homogeneous and heterogeneous iridium catalysts that yield ethylbenzene. The similar activities for high- and low-loading catalysts suggest that iridium sites, whether isolated or in the form of clusters (for example Ir
3
), have similar activity, consistent with the involvement of surface dynamics.

Main
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts, also referred to as single-atom catalysts
1
,
2
, have received increasing attention in recent years due to their unique structures and performances. The maximized atom exposure not only improves the atom efficiency in terms of the utilization of precious metals, but it also provides unconventional geometric and electronic structures to the active sites, which endows atomically dispersed metal catalysts with unique catalytic properties

Although extensive efforts have been devoted to developing synthetic methods and describing catalytic behaviours, understanding the structure–function relationship on an atomic level still remains a challenge
12
. The difficulty lies in controlling and characterizing the coordination environment around single atoms, which should largely determine the overall catalytic performance
13
,
14
,
15
. The challenges arise from several factors: first, the inherent heterogeneity of support surfaces associated with binding sites (corners, edges and faces), defects (vacancies, terraces, grain boundaries and so on) and amorphous structures (hydrated layers, amorphous supports and so on)
16
,
17
,
18
; second, the complexity of surface chemistry using conventional preparation methods, in which dissolution and/or precipitation events take place on deposition of the active centres; third, the dynamic behaviour of single atoms
19
,
20
,
21
,
22
and last the lack of available characterization techniques to probe the atoms (mostly C, N and/or O) directly bonded to the single atoms
23
,
24
,
25
. Overall, although atomically dispersed catalysts are usually referred to as analogues of well-defined homogeneous catalysts
26
,
27
, the interaction between ligands (supports) and the metal centres are far less understood by comparison with that achievable in coordination and organometallic chemistry.
To tackle these problems, we reasoned that well-defined two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, here the single-crystalline MgO(111) nanosheets
28
, could serve as an ideal support that offers a high-surface area, strong binding sites and, most importantly, a uniform coordination environment. Combined with surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), which allows the selective incorporation of active centres by grafting well-defined molecular precursors
29
,
30
,
31
, the proposed approach should provide an ideal way to generate uniform atomically dispersed metal centres on the well-defined support. We selected iridium due to its reactivity towards the selective activation of C–H bonds
32
,
33
, its catalytically activity towards the arylation of olefins with O-donor ligands
34
,
35
and its stability in a reductive environment at elevated temperatures
36
. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of atomically dispersed Ir over MgO(111) nanosheets with molecular-level precision via a SOMC approach. We found an unexpected catalytic activity in the coupling of ethylene and benzene, which yielded styrene, in contrast with the known arylation activity of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst or supported system on MgO nanoparticles (MgO-NPs), which yields ethylbenzene under similar conditions; this shows the uniqueness of iridium single-atom catalysts dispersed on MgO(111).
Results
Synthesis and characterization
Single-crystalline MgO(111) nanosheets were prepared according to a recently reported procedure
28
; they are ultrathin and preferentially oriented, with only (111) facets exposed. These MgO(111) nanosheets offer well-defined surface sites, namely three-coordinated –O
2–
anions and isolated –OH groups (2Mg–OH nm
–2
), and are thus ideally suited to serve as a support for SOMC. The nanosheets were contacted with Ir(COD)(acac) (COD, cyclooctadiene; acac, acetylacetonate) in pentane for three hours. The consumption of Mg–OH (3,573 cm
−1
), together with the appearance of bridging –O–H (3,513 and 3,374 cm
−1
) and C–H (3,080–2,840 cm
−1
) stretches according to infrared spectroscopy (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
1
) supports an anchoring process via grafting (Fig.
1a
). On grafting, the C=O stretch of the acac ligands shifted from 1,565 to 1618 cm
−1
, which is consistent with the transfer of the ligand from iridium to magnesium. In fact, similar infrared signatures at 1,620 cm
−1
for the C–O stretch and 3,513 cm
−1
for the bridging –O–H were obtained on reacting acetylacetone with MgO (Supplementary Fig.
2
) and Ir(C
2
H
4
)
2
(acac) with MgO (ref.
37
). Analysis of the supernatant showed that all Ir(COD)(acac) (~0.1 equiv. to the surface –OH groups) precursors were grafted, which thus provided a material with a 1 wt% Ir loading, as confirmed by elemental analysis (~0.2Ir nm
–2
). We also prepared a material with a 0.1 wt% Ir loading, which showed similar spectroscopic characteristics (vide infra).

We first investigated the nature of the Ir sites by CO adsorption combined with infrared spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Infrared spectroscopy of the grafted sample contacted with CO (Supplementary Fig.
3
) showed two CO bands at 2,033 and 1,953 cm
−1
on exposure to 10 µbar CO at 25 °C, which corresponds to symmetric and antisymmetric C−O vibrations bound to iridium. Treatment under a higher concentration of CO led to the complete removal of COD ligands and the reduction of Ir(I) to Ir(0) (Supplementary Fig.
3
)
38
,
39
. Similar C−O vibration bands (2,043 and 1,965 cm
−1
) associated with iridium
gem
-dicarbonyls were observed on reacting Ir(CO)
2
(acac) with the MgO support; the band broadening is probably due to CO ligands that partially decoordinate from the Ir centre to adsorb onto the MgO support—also observed when high-dose CO is adsorbed on Ir(COD)(acac)/MgO (Supplementary Fig.
3
). The presence of a
gem
-dicarbonyl iridium surface species was confirmed by isotope labelling: on adsorption of 1:1
12
CO/
13
CO, the infrared spectrum showed six bands that correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrations of the Ir(
12
CO)(
12
CO), Ir(
12
CO)(
13
CO) and Ir(
13
CO)(
13
CO) structures (Supplementary Fig.
4
)
40
,
41
. The iridium
gem
-dicarbonyl confirms the presence of isolated Ir sites and indicates the lability of the COD ligand. The Ir LIII edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum showed a slightly shifted white line compared with that of Ir(COD)(acac), which indicates a change in the coordination environment (Supplementary Fig.
5
). The Fourier-transform (FT) extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectrum could be adequately fitted using a structure close to the molecular precursor, as it shows that two oxygen atoms from the support replaced acac ligands, which is consistent with the proposed structure in Fig.
1a
. The Ir–O scattering path was shortened from 2.03 ± 0.01 Å in the free complex to 1.94 ± 0.01 Å in the grafted one. The Ir–C scattering path at 2.09 ± 0.01 Å showed no apparent changes after grafting (2.10 ± 0.01 Å) (Fig.
1c
and Supplementary Table
1
). All these data show Ir SOMC on the (111) facet of the MgO nanosheet (MgO-NS) and yield well-defined surface species, as in the starting molecular precursor.
Subsequent calcination of the grafted material in synthetic air removed all the organic ligands and led to the appearance of a new band at 3,680 cm
−1
in the infrared region, which is assigned to –OH, probably associated with the Ir–O(H)–Mg sites. No diffraction associated with the metallic iridium or IrO
x
particles was observed by powder X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Fig.
6
). Furthermore, annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) images of 1 and 0.1 wt% Ir/MgO-cal samples showed no presence of Ir nanoparticles or large clusters (Fig.
1d,e
and Supplementary Figs.
7
and
8
). In contrast, for both materials, highly dispersed Ir atoms were observed. Although only single atoms were observed at a low loading (0.1 wt%; Fig.
1d
), monomers, dimers, trimers and small clusters were found at a higher loading (1 wt%; Fig.
1e
). In the latter case, 68% of all the Ir atoms (86% of the Ir assemblies) were still single atoms based on the statistics of over 800 counts (Supplementary Fig.
7
). Interestingly, all the trimer sites appeared to be structurally similar (Fig.
1e
), with a distance of 3.0 Å between adjacent Ir atoms, which formed congruent equilateral triangles. For comparison, the Ir–Ir distance in metallic Ir is significantly shorter (2.71 Å), but in IrO
2
it is much longer (3.14 Å) than that observed here, which implies an intermediate valence state (vide infra). This interatomic distance of 3.0 Å matches quite well with those between Mg atoms on the MgO(111) surface, which probably explains the favourable formation of the dimer and trimer assemblies on this surface. This specific internuclear distance helps to distinguish the nature of adjacent Ir atoms: dimers and trimers with an Ir–Ir distance of 3.0 Å versus the neighbouring monomers with distances >3.0 Å (Supplementary Fig.
7
).
To provide further information on the overall atomic and electronic structure of Ir, XAS of 1 wt% Ir/MgO-cal was performed on the Ir LIII edge under a strict air- and moisture-free atmosphere. The white line intensity and edge energy (11,215.5 eV) determined from the first derivatives of the absorption
μ
(
E
) in XANES were slightly lower than those for IrO
2
(11,215.9 eV), which indicates a lower oxidation state of Ir (Fig.
2a
). The similar shape of the XANES spectra suggests a similar octahedral coordination structure for the Ir cations (same as for the 0.1 wt% Ir/MgO-cal). The EXAFS in
r
space had one major scattering peak at
~
2 Å, which corresponds to the first coordination shell of iridium (Ir–O; Fig.
2b
). No strong Ir–Ir distance of ~2.7 Å or Ir–O–Ir of ~3.1 Å was found, which is consistent with the presence of highly isolated atoms in the STEM images and excludes the presence of iridium or iridium oxide domains. The best fitting of the EXAFS data gave a 5.0 ± 0.4 Ir–O coordination number at a distance of 2.02 ± 0.01 Å (Supplementary Table
2
), consistent with Ir(III) (refs.
42
,
43
). The observation of a doublet at 65.5 and 62.5 eV associated with Ir 4
f
5/2
and Ir 4
f
7/2
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further confirmed the oxidation state of +III for Ir (Fig.
2c
)
44
,
45
. In addition, the symmetrical shape of this doublet is in full agreement with highly isolated Ir sites and the absence of a conductive bulk iridium (oxide) phase

Overall, we thus propose that the Ir isolated sites have a rather well-defined, possibly uniform, coordination environment, as illustrated in Fig.
2d
based on the observed highly dispersed state of iridium according to high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (Ir
1
, Ir
2
and Ir
3
assemblies), the +3 valence state and isolated nature of the Ir atoms based on XANES and XPS, the coordination structure from XANES and EXAFS (roughly octahedral) and the known well-defined surface structure of MgO(111) nanosheets. The calcined MgO(111) nanosheets are terminated by threefold coordinated O anions (O
3c
2–
) in a threefold symmetry
28
, and the observed, by microscopy, Ir atoms in a +3 oxidation state (XPS and XANES) points to their location on the MgO surface (Fig.
1a
) rather than in the lattice (MgO has an extremely low atom mobility due to the ionic bonding and a valence of two)
47
. A closer look at the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images (Fig.
1d,e
and Supplementary Figs.
7
and
8
) reveals that Ir sites exclusively sit on the bright row of Mg atom sites, which indicates that they are located at positions on top of the Mg cations. Moreover, given that Mg
2+
and Ir
3+
both favour an octahedral environment and that Mg–O and Ir–O have similar bond lengths
48
,
49
, the supported iridium species probably adopt the same position and geometry as the Mg
2+
cations at the surface of the nanosheets. In fact, the 3.0 Å sides of the Ir
3
equilateral triangles are identical to the Mg–Mg distance on the MgO(111) projection (2.98 Å). We thus propose that the Ir trimers are stabilized by six O
3c
2–
sites from the MgO(111) surface of the support (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Fig.
9
), and bridged by one μ
3
-O
2–
anion in the middle for charge balance—the scheme represents an idealized structure with –OH ligands; although this level of information cannot be resolved with state-of-art transmission electron microscopy or conventional characterization techniques, it is consistent with available information. Such a structure further supports that the exposed (111) facet of single crystalline MgO-NS can offer ordered binding sites, namely O
3c
2–
sites for supported species. Regarding Ir monomers, the most plausible binding structure is that each Ir(III) cation is anchored by three O
3c
2–
or –OH
3c
sites on MgO(111), coordinates with a hydroxide ion (to balance the charge) and a water molecule (to complete the five Ir–O coordination), as shown in Fig.
2d
. Such a structure was also proposed to be the most stable one on the edge sites of MgO(100) nanocubes
37
. The single crystallinity of the support and the exposed ordered crystalline plane are ideally suited to minimize the surface heterogeneity for anchoring atomically dispersed species.
Catalytic properties
Both 1 wt% and 0.1 wt% Ir/MgO-cal were then evaluated in the coupling reaction of benzene and ethylene at 3 bar and 180 °C and compared with those of Ir(O,O-acac)
2
(C-acac)(py) and Ir(O,O-acac)
2
(Ph)(py) (py = pyridine), which are known homogeneous hydroarylation catalysts
36
. We also prepared 1.6 ± 0.4 nm silica-supported Ir nanoparticles as a metallic iridium reference and a high surface area IrO
x
as an oxide reference (Supplementary Figs.
10
–
12
)
50
. Both Ir/MgO-cal catalysts led to the formation of styrene as the major product (94 and >99% selectivity for the 1 and 0.1 wt% materials, respectively; Table
1
, entries 1 and 2), which sharply contrasts with those observed for the corresponding homogeneous catalytic systems that yield ethylbenzene (Table
1
, entries 3 and 4). Note that the turnover numbers (TONs) for 1 and 0.1 wt% materials are similar, which will be discussed later. The absence of conversion of benzene with a MgO support alone, silica-supported Ir nanoparticles or IrO
x
nanoparticles (Table
1
, Entries 5-7) supports that isolated Ir sites on MgO are important to catalyse this reaction.
Table 1 Catalytic activities
Full size table
Such an observation highlights that atomically dispersed metal catalysts behave distinctively from their homogeneous counterparts, even though the active metal centres and the surrounding atoms from ligands are the same. To further evaluate the role of the support, we prepared another atomically dispersed Ir catalyst supported on irregular-shaped MgO-NPs as a reference material (0.1 w% Ir/MgO-NP; Supplementary Figs.
13
and
14
). However, Ir/MgO-NPs only lead to the production of ethylbenzene (Table
1
, entry 7), similar to the homogeneous catalysts but contrary to Ir/MgO-cal. Such a difference in the product is probably due to the special preferential orientation and specific electronic properties of the well-defined MgO(111) support. This polar surface has been proposed to have unique catalytic properties
51
,
52
, which inspired us to study the reaction mechanism with combined infrared, ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis, isotope labelling and solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy.
Mechanistic study
To determine whether Ir/MgO-cal catalysed the reaction through benzene C–H activation, as for bis-acac-O,O-Ir(III) complexes (which form phenyl–iridium complexes after reaction)
36
, the spent catalyst was analysed by infrared spectroscopy. A C–H stretch over 3,000 cm
−1
and a C–C stretch in the aromatic rings at around 1,500 cm
−1
proved the generation of phenyl–iridium intermediates (Supplementary Fig.
15
), which was also observed on the material pretreated in benzene without ethylene (Supplementary Fig.
16
). When C
6
D
6
was used instead, an O–D stretch at 2,600 cm
−1
was observed, which might be due to the formation of HOD as a result of C–D activation (Supplementary Fig.
16
). The generated HOD further protonated the MgO support to form –OD groups. To further characterize the adsorbed species,
1
H,
13
C cross-polarization magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra were recorded for Ir/MgO-cal pretreated with
13
C-benzene at 180 °C for three hours, followed by evacuation under a high vacuum. The
13
C ssNMR spectrum shows signals at 139 (Ir–C), 127 (
ortho-
and
meta
-C) and 118 (
para
-C) ppm, as expected for phenyl–iridium species (Supplementary Fig.
17
), with similar chemical shifts as compared with those of the Ir(O,O-acac)
2
(Ph)(py) complex (137, 131, 125 and 122 ppm). A signal at 170 ppm is assigned to the adsorbed carboxylate species, probably generated from the oxidation of benzene by surface superoxide ions (Supplementary Fig.
18
)
53
,
54
. Another evidence for the formation of phenyl–iridium intermediates is that the colour changed from light yellow to green after treating the catalysts. In fact, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy showed a new absorbance band at 680 cm
−1
, assigned to the
d
–
d
transition between iridium and phenyl ligands (Supplementary Fig.
19
). In contrast, in the absence of atomically dispersed iridium, the MgO-NS support alone could not activate benzene to form a chemisorbed phenyl moiety (Supplementary Fig.
20
), which further supports that C–H bond activation takes place on Ir sites (Supplementary Fig.
21
).
To generate styrene, a PhCH
2
CH
2
–Ir intermediate is probably also formed via olefin insertion, as proposed for the corresponding homogeneous catalysts
55
. The spent catalysts using isotope-labelled reagents (
13

) were then characterized utilizing
1
H detected 2D
1
H,
13
C correlation ssNMR spectroscopy (Fig.

)
56
. In addition to the set of peaks observed on reaction of the catalyst with
13
C-benzene, new signals appeared at 19 (Ir-α-
C
H
2
) and 24 (β-
C
H
2
) as well as 129 (phenyl-
C
) ppm, consistent with the proposed PhCH
2
CH
2
–Ir intermediate. We propose that this intermediate undergoes β-hydride eliminations to generate styrene and a metal hydride intermediate
57
,
58
. The production of C
2
H
6
and H
2
according to gas chromatography analysis is consistent with the formation of these iridium hydrides (Supplementary Fig.
22
); the hydrogenation of ethene to ethane allows the formation of styrene. We also observed the kinetic isotope effect on using D-labelled substrates, with secondary kinetic isotope effects of 1.13 for the reactions carried out with C

versus C

(Supplementary Table

sp
3
to
sp
2
during the process (1.1–1.2) (ref.
59
) and thereby the β-hydride elimination pathway. Based on these experimental results and previous studies on related homogeneous systems, we propose that the catalytic reaction occurs through C–H activation, olefin insertion and β-hydride elimination along with hydrogenation of ethylene as a driving force to release styrene (Fig.
3b
).

When propene was used in place of ethylene, linear (anti-Markovnikov products, 1-phenylpropene and/or allylbenzene) along with branched products (Markovnikov product, 2-phenylpropene) were produced, with a linear/branched ratio of 35/65. This contrasts with that observed for the homogeneous Ir catalysts, for which the linear hydroarylation product is favoured with a linear/branched ratio of 61/39 (
n
-propylbenzene versus cumene). Such a difference indicates that the β-hydride elimination from the [phenylalkyl–iridium] intermediate is probably rate limiting.
The reaction mechanism shown in Fig.
3
is proposed based on proposals for the corresponding homogeneous hydroarylation catalysts
60
,
61
. The main difference is that no external oxidant is needed to accept the released hydrogen. Such a process is not accessible over homogeneous Ir catalysts and MgO-NP-supported Ir single sites, given the different catalytic performance. The difference of products between Ir/MgO-cal (styrene) and Ir/MgO-NP, as well as the homogeneous catalysts (ethylbenzene), indicate that the former promote further dehydrogenation. As the polar MgO(111) surface exposes very basic oxygen surface sites
51
,
62
, we tentatively propose that they probably assist the formation of styrene, either by participating at the hydrogen abstraction from the phenylethyl iridium intermediates or by dehydrogenating ethylbenzene
63
.
Stability evaluation
In the catalytic benzene–ethylene coupling over 1 wt% Ir/MgO-cal, it is worth mentioning that the conversion (TON based on exposed Ir sites) increases linearly and constantly over time for at least three hours (Supplementary Table
4
and Supplementary Fig.
23
), as expected for a stable catalytic system. We thus characterized the spent catalysts using combined XAS, XPS and ADF-STEM. Both Ir LIII edge XAS (11,215.7 eV) and Ir 4
f
XPS (65.8 and 62.8 eV) showed that Ir species retained their +III oxidation state (Supplementary Fig.
24
).
The Ir atoms remained highly dispersed, as evidenced in ADF-STEM images (Fig.
4
and Supplementary Fig.
25
): although the number of monomers decreased from 86 to 68%, no Ir nanoparticles were formed. For the low-loading catalysts (0.1 wt% Ir/MgO-cal), the atomic dispersion of Ir was fully maintained despite the high reaction temperature and reductive atmosphere (Supplementary Fig.
26
). In contrast to other supported catalysts for olefin hydroarylation
64
, no apparent leaching was evident for iridium supported on MgO. This is consistent with the absence of an induction period, the selectivity–time plot (Supplementary Fig.
23
) and the observation of similar Ir monomeric sites with no aggregation on the low-loading sample. The absence of leaching is probably due to the strong bonding between the Ir(III) cations and O
2−
anions of the polar MgO(111) surface.

Given that the atomic dispersion of a 0.1 wt% catalyst is preserved after the reaction, the overall catalytic performance is attributed to single Ir atoms (with a uniform dispersion and similar coordination structure). Note that the similar TOFs observed for the 0.1 wt% (only Ir monomers supported) and 1 wt% (Ir monomers, dimers and trimers supported) materials suggest that Ir cations have a similar activity, whether they are in the form of monomers, dimers and trimers, which could be due to their intrinsic property or the presence of surface dynamics. Under the reaction conditions, the trimers and dimers may dynamically reorganize and catalyse the reaction as monomers.
As the reaction time was prolonged, small clusters and nanoparticles were formed on the 1 wt% catalyst, which paralleled the decline in activity. The catalyst can be regenerated by simple calcination in air (the TON of the regenerated catalyst was 142 for three hours). To study the regeneration process (the effect of reductive reaction conditions versus the oxidative calcination conditions), we prepared another 1 wt% material by reducing the grafted Ir(COD)(acac)/MgO under H
2
at 400 °C for six hours, whereby similar small clusters (diameter around 1 nm) along with some isolated sites were observed. However, further calcination of the pre-reduced materials led to a redispersion of the Ir species into atomically dispersed sites, which clearly indicates the influence of chemical potential on the state of iridium and that oxidative conditions favour the dispersion of iridium (Supplementary Fig.
28
). In fact, Ir atoms remain isolated even after reducing the 0.1 wt% material under H
2
at 400 °C for a six hour reduction (Supplementary Fig.
29
). Such a high stability is attributed to the strong bonding between Ir cations and the MgO(111) surface. The low-coordinated O
3c
2–
as the only binding sites for iridium on well-defined MgO(111) nanosheets are shown to be strong donor ligands for iridium.
Conclusions
Using a SOMC approach and well-defined MgO(111) nanosheets, we prepared atomically dispersed iridium. At 1 wt% loading, site-isolated monomers and O-bridged Ir dimers and trimers were the major species; whereas at a low loading of Ir(III) cations, all the monomers have identical coordination structures due to the uniform surface structure of the support. Both catalysts show activity in benzene–ethylene coupling towards styrene, distinct from the behaviour of homogeneous catalysts and atomically dispersed iridium on MgO-NPs, which led to the production of ethylbenzene. XAS, XPS and ADF-STEM show that the atomic dispersion of Ir species is maintained after the catalytic reaction, probably due to the strong ionic interaction between Ir and MgO(111) supports. This study illustrates the power of combining a SOMC approach with crystalline 2D supports, which preferentially expose one facet to form atomically dispersed catalysts with a well-defined coordination structure according to the available data. This approach opens the possibility of a better understanding of structure–function relationships and offers the opportunity not only to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, but also to uncover new reactions.

aqueous solution (0.125 M) under vigorous stirring at room temperature. After 10 min, the precipitation was collected via filtration, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried under a reduced pressure. The yielded white powder was transferred into an alumina crucible and calcined at 500 °C (the ramping rate was controlled at 2 °C min
–1
) for 2 h under an air atmosphere. The MgO product was added into deionized water (1 mg ml
–1
) under stirring at room temperature. After 1 h, the product was collected via filtration and dried under a reduced pressure. the Mg(OH)
2
product was heated to 600 °C for 12 h under a high vacuum. During both the ramping and heating processes, the reactor was evacuated with pressure lower than 10
–5
mbar. The ramping rate was 1 °C min
–1
. The final product was collected and stored in an argon-filled glove box, denoted as MgO-NS and used as the support.
Synthesis of Ir-based catalysts
(Acetylacetonato)(1,5-cyclooctadiene)iridium(I) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Pentane was dried using an MBraun solvent purification system (SPS 800), and stored in the presence of 4 Å molecule sieves in a glove box. Synthetic air and H
2
were purified over activated 4 Å molecular sieves. All the experiments (support handling, material synthesis, storage and regular characterization) were performed under a N
2
or Ar atmosphere in an MBraun UNIlab glove box (water and oxygen levels were kept below 0.1 ppm) or standard Schlenk techniques. Elemental analyses were performed by Mikroanalytisches Labor Pascher.
To MgO-NS (200 mg) dispersed in pentane (20 ml) in a 50 ml Schlenk flask was added a solution of Ir(COD)(acac) (4.15 mg) in pentane (2 ml) under stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. After removing the solvent in vacuo, the resulting material was washed with pentane and dried under a high vacuum (10
–5
mbar) to give Ir(COD)(acac)/MgO (elemental analysis, Ir, 0.9%; Ir:C ≈ 1:15). The 0.1 wt% sample was prepared in the same manner using 0.4 mg of Ir(COD)(acac).
Ir(COD)(acac)/MgO was added to a tubular glass flow reactor supported by a frit. The reactor was heated, ramping at 1 °C min
–1
to 400 °C and kept at 400 °C for 12 h under a steady flow of synthetic air. After cooling down to room temperature, the reactor was evacuated under a high vacuum to yield a light-yellow powder and denoted as Ir/MgO-cal (elemental analysis, Ir, 0.9%).

Synthesis of Ir/SiO
2
, IrO

and Ir/MgO-NP
Silica-supported Ir nanoparticles were prepared as a reference according to a previously reported method
50
. Iridium oxide materials were synthesized via a modified chlorine-free Adams fusion method
44
,
67
.
MgO-NP-supported Ir single site catalysts were prepared as follows. To MgO-NP (200 mg; see the first step in the preparation of the MgO(111) nanosheet support (Synthesis of the support)) in pentane (20 ml) in a 50 ml Schlenk flask was added Ir(COD)(acac) (0.4 mg) dissolved in pentane (2 ml) with stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. After solvent removal, the material was washed with pentane, dried under a high vacuum (10
–5
mbar) and calcined using the same protocol as for Ir/MgO-cal. The thus-obtained light-yellow powder was denoted as Ir/MgO-NP.
Infrared spectroscopy characterization
All the infrared measurements were conducted using a Bruker FT-IR Alpha spectrometer equipped with a middle infrared source placed inside a glove box, and the OPUS software used. For the transmission mode, self-supported pellets of the interested sample were pressed without dilution. For the attenuated total reflectance mode, a platinum attenuated total reflectance accessory was used. All the measurements consisted of 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm
–1
and then were averaged.
Self-supporting pellets of Ir(COD)(acac)/MgO was compressed and submitted to an atmosphere of CO (or isotope-labelled CO). The pressure of the CO was kept lower than 10 mbar to prevent the migration of Ir unless specified. For the isotope-labelled study, a mixture of
12
CO and
13
CO was used instead of pure CO. After CO adsorption, the sample was measured using the FT infrared method described above.
For comparison, MgO-NS-supported Ir(CO)
2
(acac) and acetylacetone were prepared. (Acetylacetonato)dicarbonylrhodium(I) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. For Ir(CO)
2
(acac)/MgO, 200 mg of MgO-NS was added to a 50 ml Schlenk flask and dispersed by 20 ml of pentane. Ir(CO)
2
(acac) (3.6 mg) was dissolved in pentane to give a light-yellow solution and added to the MgO suspension during stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred for 3 h at room temperature before the solvent was removed. The material was washed with pentane and dried under a high vacuum (10
–5
mbar) and denoted as Ir(CO)
2
(acac)/MgO.
For MgO-supported acetylacetone, 50 mg of MgO-NS was added to a 50 ml Schlenk flask and dispersed by 20 ml of pentane. Diluted acetylacetone in pentane (2.6 μmol acetylacetone) was added to the MgO suspension with stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred for 3 h at room temperature before the solvent was removed. The material was washed with pentane and dried under a high vacuum (10
–5
mbar) and denoted as Hacac/MgO.
XAS study
The XAS measurement at the Ir LIII edge was carried out at the SuperXAS beamline at the Swiss Light Source (PSI). The storage ring was operated at 2.4 GeV in the top-up mode with a ring current of around 400 mA. The incident photon beam provided by a 2.9 T superbend magnet was selected by a Si(111) quick-EXAFS monochromator. The beam size on the sample was 100 × 100 μm. During measurements, the monochromator was rotated with a 1 Hz frequency in a 2° angular range and X-ray absorption spectra were collected in the transmission mode using ionization chambers specially developed for quick data collection with a 1 MHz frequency. The beam-line energy was calibrated with iridium foil to the Ir LIII edge position at 11,215 eV. To avoid contact with air, the potentially air-sensitive samples were sealed in aluminium plastic bags (polyaniline (15 μm), polyethylene (15 μm), Al (12 μm) and polyethylene (75 μm) from Gruber-Folien GmbH & Co. KG) inside a glove box. Data processing was done by standard procedures using the ProXASGui software developed at the SuperXAS beamline, PSI.
The program package Demeter was used for the data analysis. Simulations of EXAFS scattering paths to conduct fits of the experimental data were calculated using the ab initio self-consistent field computational code FEFF8.2. The model of bulk IrO
2
and the Ir(COD)(acac) complex was built with the Diamond program. Coordinates of the model were then used in the FEFF input file. S0
2
values for the Ir LIII edge were obtained by fitting the pristine complex and the standard IrO
2
reference. Coordination numbers were fixed for both cases. The workup of raw XAFS data to the
k
-space and Fourier transformed
R
-space involved energy calibration, background subtraction and
µ
0
fitting. All the data were processed using a consistent methodology of background subtraction, conversion to
k
-space and conversion to FT
R
-space. Δ
E
0
values were correlated for multipath fitting. No other parameters were fixed, constrained or correlated during the fitting.
Electron microscopy study
TEM images of Ir/SiO
2
were recorded on an FEI Talos F200X instrument. The TEM sample was prepared inside a glove box (under an atmosphere of Ar) by directly depositing the sample powder on a Lacey-C 300 mesh Cu grid. The loaded grid was then mounted on a vacuum transfer tomography holder from Fischione Instruments (model no. 2560) and transferred to the chamber of the TEM without air contact. High-resolution ADF-STEM images of Ir/MgO-cal were obtained on an aberration-corrected JEM ARM300F (Grand ARM) transmission electron microscope within the facilities of ScopeM. For the STEM measurement, the TEM samples were prepared in air.
XPS study
XPS was performed at ETH Zurich using the SIGMA II instrument equipped with an Al/Mg twin anode. The vacuum in the chamber was around 2.2 × 10
−8
mbar during the measurements. The experiment was conducted using an Al Kα source (energy = 1,486.6 eV) in the LAXPS mode. The beam was operated at 13.7 mA and 15 kV (200 W). The data analysis was performed using CasaXPS utilizing a linear background. Peak fits were achieved using Gaussian–Lorentzian (GL30) line shapes. The Ir 4
f
doublet separation was fixed at 3.0 eV.
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy–UV–vis study
Diffuse reflectance spectra were measured at room temperature using an Agilent Cary 5000 UV–vis near infrared spectrometer (200–800 nm at a 10 nm s
−1
scan rate) equipped with a Harrick Scientific Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory. Samples were placed in a sample chamber with quartz windows to preserve the inert (argon) atmosphere.

Catalytic performance evaluation
Benzene and benzene-
d
6
were distilled from sodium in the presence of benzophenone, degassed via three freeze–pump–thaw cycles and stored over 4 Å molecule sieves in a glove box. In a Fisher-Porter reactor, 100 mg of Ir/MgO-cal and 3 ml of benzene were introduced. After freezing benzene with liquid nitrogen, the reactor was evacuated at 10
–5
mbar. The reactor was allowed to warm to room temperature and filled with ethylene (3.5, Pangas) to 3 bar. The reaction was carried out at 180 °C for 3 h. The liquid mixture and spent catalyst was then collected inside the glove box. Catalytic tests were evaluated using gas chromatography–flame ionization detection (Agilent Technologies 7890 A) equipped with a split/splitless injector heated to 250 °C, injection volume 0.5 μl and hydrogen as the carrier gas.
