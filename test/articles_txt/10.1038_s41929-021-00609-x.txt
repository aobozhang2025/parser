Abstract
Developing artificial enzymes with the excellent catalytic performance of natural enzymes has been a long-standing goal for chemists. Single-atom catalysts with well-defined atomic structure and electronic coordination environments can effectively mimic natural enzymes. Here, we report an engineered FeN
3
P-centred single-atom nanozyme (FeN
3
P-SAzyme) that exhibits comparable peroxidase-like catalytic activity and kinetics to natural enzymes, by controlling the electronic structure of the single-atom iron active centre through the precise coordination of phosphorus and nitrogen. In particular, the engineered FeN
3
P-SAzyme, with well-defined geometric and electronic structures, displays catalytic performance that is consistent with Michaelis–Menten kinetics. We rationalize the origin of the high enzyme-like activity using density functional theory calculations. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed FeN
3
P-SAzyme with superior peroxidase-like activity can be used as an effective therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumour cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, SAzymes show promising potential for developing artificial enzymes that have the catalytic kinetics of natural enzymes.

In this Article, we develop an atomic-level engineered FeN
3
P single-atom peroxidase nanozyme (FeN
3
P-SAzyme) by modulating the single-atom iron (Fe) active centre through the precise coordination of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). We demonstrate that FeN
3
P-SAzyme shows comparable catalytic activity and kinetics to natural enzyme peroxidase. Thus, by precise engineering of the electronic and geometric structure of the active centre, single-atom nanozymes could open a promising route to developing artificial enzymes as the most favourable alternative to natural enzymes. Furthermore, the developed single-atom nanozymes will also provide a bridge between enzymatic catalysis, homogeneous catalysis and heterogeneous catalysis.
Results
Synthesis and structural characterizations of FeN
3
P-SAzyme
The synthesis of FeN
3
P-SAzyme is schematically illustrated in Fig.
1a
. Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) (as a carbon and nitrogen precursor) was first prepared as the raw material by a solvothermal method (Supplementary Fig.
1
). The P species is an essential component of many natural enzymes and plays a key role in assisting electron tunnelling from the substrate to the active centre of the enzyme
31
,
32
. Thus, we employed P as the precursor in the synthesis system to anchor the metal active centre and, at the same time, to regulate the local coordination structure. Then, Fe ions and monomers of poly-(cyclotriphospazene-co-4,4′-diaminodiphenylether) (PZM) were coated on the surface of ZIF-8 by polymerization to give a Fe/ZIF-8@PZM core–shell composite. As shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, the prepared Fe/ZIF-8@PZM had a similar polyhedral morphology to pure ZIF-8 (Supplementary Fig.
2
). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Fe/ZIF-8@PZM was consistent with that of ZIF-8, indicating that the extra addition of PZM polymer had no effect on the crystallization of ZIF-8 (Supplementary Fig.
3
). Further observations using high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) demonstrated that the PZM shell was uniformly coated on the surface of ZIF-8. This was confirmed by an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mappings analysis which showed uniform dispersion of Fe, C, N and P elements on the whole coating layer (Supplementary Fig.
4
). FeN
3
P-SAzyme was finally obtained by pyrolysis of Fe/ZIF-8@PZM at 950 °C for 3 hours under flowing nitrogen.

FeN
3
P-SAzyme was thoroughly characterized by various methods. TEM and high angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images indicated that FeN
3
P-SAzyme retained the initial polyhedral morphology, with a crumpled surface (Fig.
1b,c
and Supplementary Fig.
5
). EDS analysis showed that Fe, C, N and P elements were homogeneously dispersed throughout the entire architecture of FeN
3
P-SAzyme (Fig.
1d
). An aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM (AC HAADF-STEM) measurement was performed to offer a direct insight into the atomic structure of FeN
3
P-SAzyme. The obvious individual bright dots (highlighted by yellow circles) showed the atomic dispersion of single Fe atoms over FeN
3
P-SAzyme (Fig.
1e–g
). The XRD pattern of FeN
3
P-SAzyme demonstrated that only two broad peaks located near 25 and 44° were detected, which were attributed to the characteristic diffractions of graphitic carbon (Supplementary Fig.
6
). No signals of Fe nanoparticles were observed, indicating no obvious aggregation of the Fe species in FeN
3
P-SAzyme. Selected-area electron-diffraction (SAED) analysis showed a ring-like pattern (inset of Supplementary Fig.
6
), confirming the atomic dispersion of single Fe atoms in FeN
3
P-SAzyme. For nitrogen sorption measurements, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis and the related pore size distribution (Supplementary Fig.
7
) showed that FeN
3
P-SAzyme possessed a porous structure with a large surface area, which was beneficial to the exposure of Fe active sites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to investigate the binding states of C, N and P on FeN
3
P-SAzyme. The C 1
s
spectrum was well-fitted with three peaks at 288.2 eV (C–N), 285.7 eV (C–P) and 284.7 eV (C=C) (Supplementary Fig.
8
). The N 1
s
spectrum demonstrated the coexistence of graphitic N (401.4 eV), pyridinic N (398.6 eV) and pyrrolic N (400.5 eV), which were employed to stabilize the Fe atoms (Supplementary Fig.
9
). The P 2
p
XPS spectrum of FeN
3
P-SAzyme exhibited three peaks at binding energies of 132.9, 129.5 and 128.7 eV (Supplementary Fig.
10
). The broad peak at 132.9 eV was indexed to the P–C contribution and the characteristic peaks located at 129.5 and 128.7 eV were attributed to the P 2
p
1/2
and P 2
p
3/2
contributions of Fe–P. For comparison, the P 2
p
XPS spectrum of the Fe-free N and P co-doped carbon (NP-C) catalyst was obtained. Only one broad peak at 132.9 eV ascribed to the P–C contribution was observed in the P 2
p
XPS spectrum of the NP-C catalyst. This result further confirmed that the characteristic peaks located at 129.5 and 128.7 eV corresponded to the Fe–P contribution. Based on XPS analysis, the elemental atomic contents of Fe, N and P were calculated to be 0.84, 7.36 and 0.91%, respectively. These results confirmed that P and N species were doped into the three-dimensional carbon framework.

P-SAzyme by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy
The coordination environment and chemical state of FeN
3
P-SAzyme were next investigated by both Fe and P K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. Figure
2a
shows the Fe K-edge extended-XAFS (EXAFS) Fourier-transformed magnitudes. Both FeN
3
P-SAzyme and FeN
4
-SAzyme showed major peaks at 1.60 Å, which agreed well with the Fe–N peak in iron-porphyrin (FePc) and were attributed to the backscattering between Fe and N atoms. The major peak intensity in FeN
3
P-SAzyme was obviously weaker than that in FeN
4
-SAzyme. This was due to the partial substitution of N by P that introduced destructive interference in the first Fe–N coordination shell (Supplementary Fig.
11
). In addition, a minor peak was observed at 2.37 Å, which was larger than the Fe–Fe peak at 2.2 Å in bulk Fe but was close to the minor peak at 2.45 Å in FePc. Thus, the minor peak arose from Fe–C backscattering. It is noteworthy that this characteristic minor peak was obviously distinct from the shoulder peak at ~2.1 Å for the divacancy-based motif in graphene
20
, indicating a probable porphyrin-based motif. Quantitative EXAFS curve-fitting analysis was then performed to investigate the coordination configuration (Fig.
2b
, Supplementary Figs.
12
–
14
; Supplementary Table
1
). FeN
4
-SAzyme was verified to adopt a porphyrin-based FeN
4
C
4
configuration. By contrast, the best fit for FeN
3
P-SAzyme showed three coordination shells of Fe–N/O, Fe–P and Fe–C with coordination numbers of 3.6, 1.1 and 4.3, respectively (Fig.
2b
, Supplementary Figs.
13
and
14
and Supplementary Table
1
), suggesting a porphyrin-based FeN
3
PC
4
moiety with axial oxygen ligands. Based on the above analysis, we constructed structural models of FeN
3
P-SAzyme and FeN
4
-SAzyme (inset of Supplementary Fig.
13a
). When we performed theoretical simulations to produce the corresponding EXAFS spectra based on the structural models, the theoretically simulated EXAFS spectra matched well with the experimental ones (Supplementary Fig.
13b
), which provides strong proof to demonstrate the rationality of the structural models. Figure
2c
shows the Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) profiles, where the absorption edge of FeN
3
P-SAzyme is close to that of FePc, indicating that the atomically dispersed Fe species carry positive charge of ~+2. As the Fe K-edge white-line peak arises from the transition from 1
s
to 4
p
unoccupied states, this means that a higher white-line peak intensity should correspond to more electron transfer from Fe to the coordination atoms and vice versa. It can be seen that FeN
3
P-SAzyme showed a flattened white-line peak at 7,132 eV with a weaker intensity compared with FeN
4
-SAzyme. This was caused by less electron transfer from Fe to N atoms in FeN
3
P-SAzyme than that in FeN
4
-SAzyme due to the electron donation of P atom, that is, the electron can transfer from P→Fe→N because of the weaker electronegativity of P than N atoms
33
. This result also confirms the active Fe centre of FeN
3
P-SAzyme is coordinated by a P atom and this is also confirmed by the P K-edge XANES in Fig.
2d
. The P K-edge white-line peak of FeN
3
P-SAzyme was obviously shifted to low energy compared with the pure support material without Fe species (marked as NP-C). This was attributed to the less electron transfer from P and C to N atoms in FeN
3
P-SAzyme than that in NP-C due to the existence of the electron transferring from Fe to N atoms in FeN
3
P-SAzyme. Therefore, the combination of Fe and P K-edge EXAFS results strongly supports the substitution of N by P atoms around the Fe centre to form a porphyrin-like FeN
3
PC
4
moiety in FeN
3
P-SAzyme. According to the EXAFS results and the elemental content analysis by XPS, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to optimize the porphyrin-based structural model (inset of Fig.
2b
) and confirm the thermodynamic stability of FeN
3
P-SAzyme (Supplementary Table
2
).

Peroxidase-like activity characterization of FeN
3
P-SAzyme
We next characterized the peroxidase-like activities of FeN
3
P-SAzyme. This was inspired by the similarities of the chemical environments of as-synthesized FeN
3
P-SAzyme and the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Supplementary Fig.
15
). FeN
3
P-SAzyme showed peroxidase-like activity by catalysing the oxidation of peroxidase artificial substrates (for example, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), diazoaminobenzene (DAB), or
o
-phenylenediamine (OPD)) in the presence of H
2
O
2
to provide a colour reaction (Fig.
3a
). While FeN
3
P-SAzyme showed high catalytic activity under a wide range of temperatures (30–60 °C) and pH values (3–5) (Supplementary Fig.
16
), HRP has an optimum temperature of around 37 °C and an optimum pH of around 3.6 (refs.
1
,
34
). To make a valid comparison between the nanozymes and natural HRP, an identical temperature of 37 °C and a pH of 3.6 were chosen for the kinetic measurements. HRP can exhibit optimum catalytic efficiency under suitable measurement conditions.

We first quantitatively determined the specific activity values (U mg
–1
) by measuring the absorption intensity of the nanozyme-catalysed colorimetric reactions. FeN
3
P-SAzyme showed much higher catalytic activity compared to the most widely used Fe
3
O
4
nanozyme or FeN
4
-SAzyme without P coordination. The measured specific activity of FeN
3
P-SAzyme (316 U mg
–1
) is more than 30-fold higher than that of the Fe
3
O
4
nanozyme (9.12 U mg
–1
) and almost 10-fold higher than that of the FeN
4
-SAzyme (33.8 U mg
–1
) (Fig.
3b,c
). The Fe-free NP-C support showed the lowest catalytic performance among the synthesized nanozymes (Supplementary Fig.
17
). The catalytic performance of the nanozymes is dependent on their kinetics
35
. We next investigated the catalytic mechanism of FeN
3
P-SAzyme and determined its kinetic parameters based on the Fe active sites doped on the nanozyme particles. FeN
3
P-SAzyme catalysed the oxidation of peroxidase substrate TMB with comparable catalytic efficiency (

The kinetic parameters for H
2
O
2
and OPD substrates were also determined (Supplementary Figs.
19
and
20
) confirming again the excellent catalytic performance of FeN
3
P-SAzyme. The increased
K
m
values for H
2
O
2
or the OPD substrate suggested a lower binding affinity for FeN
3
P-SAzyme than for the TMB substrate. In addition, the superoxide dismutase- and catalase-like activities of FeN
3
P-SAzyme were also measured and determined to be 14.49 and 51.2 U mg
–1
(Supplementary Fig.
21
), respectively. These values are much lower than those of the natural enzymes, showing the catalytic specificity of FeN
3
P-SAzyme.
In addition, the stability of FeN
3
P-SAzyme was evaluated using high-resolution TEM, XRD, EDS elemental analysis, AC HAADF-STEM and XAFS analysis (Supplementary Figs.
22
–
25
). No substantial morphological or elemental changes were detected after catalytic oxidation reactions in the presence of peroxidase substrates. The Fe K-edge XAFS spectra of the spent FeN
3
P-SAzyme showed no obvious changes compared with those of the fresh FeN
3
P-SAzyme. These findings suggest that FeN
3
P-SAzyme is sufficiently stable to maintain the atomic dispersion of the Fe active sites through the catalytic reactions.
These results show that artificial nanozymes catalysing enzyme-like reactions can possess the fundamental characteristics of natural enzymes such as fast kinetics, high productivity and high selectivity under the same reaction conditions. By engineering the electronic structure and coordination environment of the metal active centre, the well-defined SAzymes show promising potential to replace natural enzymes in specific enzyme-based applications.
DFT studies on the peroxidase-like activity of FeN
3
P-SAzyme
To further understand the origin of the high peroxidase-like catalytic efficiency of FeN
3
P-SAzyme, we performed DFT calculations on the oxidation process of peroxidase substrates by the surface OH or O species from molecular H
2
O
2
reduction on the single-atom metal centres. According to the XAFS results and the elemental content analysis by XPS, as well as DFT results comparing the doping energies of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen in the FeN
4
and FeN
3
P models (Supplementary Fig.
26
), three catalyst models of FeN
3
P-SAzyme, FeN

Among these three catalysts, H

has the strongest adsorption energy of –1.24 eV on the Fe

(111) surface, followed by FeN

3
P-SAzyme has the weakest adsorption energy of –0.40 eV. Then, the adsorbed H

will be easily dissociated into two surface OH species (H

P-SAzyme, the surface O atom first needs to migrate to the top Fe site from the top P site with a reaction energy of 0.75 eV and then the oxidation reaction will occur with a lower reaction energy of 0.44 eV. The results of the calculations show that the second step of the surface O atom formation (2OH → O + H

O) is the rate-determining step in the peroxidase-like catalysis on FeN

-SAzyme and Fe

(111) (1.05 and 1.51 eV), while the migration of an O atom from the top Fe site to the top P site is the rate-determining step on FeN

P-SAzyme (0.75 eV). It can be clearly seen that FeN
3
P-SAzyme has the highest catalytic activity.
In an acidic medium (Supplementary Fig.
29
), the calculations show that when there are two surface species of OH from H

3
P-SAzyme, indicating that the surface OH and O atoms can both be formed in the catalytic process. On FeN
4
-SAzyme, both of the reactions are difficult (2.84 versus 1.05 eV), suggesting that although the surface OH species can be formed easily from H
2
O
2
dissociation, it will be stuck to the active centre of the Fe atom. On Fe

O
4
(111), the 2OH + H → OH + H
2
O reaction is much faster than the 2OH → O + H
2
O reaction (0.11 versus 1.51 eV). This reflects the fact that the surface OH species will be transformed promptly into H
2
O in acidic conditions and that the catalytic cycle cannot be completed. Similarly, the desorption of H
2
O and the oxidation of peroxidase substrates by the surface OH species are calculated in thermodynamically. The calculations show that the desorption of H

(111) in thermodynamically. On FeN
3
P-SAzyme, the migration of surface OH from the top P site to the top Fe site, as well as the oxidation reaction, can occur easily with lower reaction energies of 0.44 and 0.41 eV.
In summary, from the above calculations it can be concluded that FeN
3
P-SAzyme has higher peroxidase-like catalytic activity because of the lower barriers for O and OH formation (<0.5 eV), while FeN
4
-SAzyme and Fe
3
O
4
(111) hardly accomplish the catalytic process in acidic conditions. This agrees well with the experimental results. For FeN
4
-SAzyme, because the surface OH species is not easily transformed into a H
2
O molecule (1.05 eV), it will be stuck to the active centre of the Fe atom, suppressing the whole catalytic process. For Fe
3
O

(111), the surface OH species can be instantaneously converted into a H
2
O molecule (0.11 eV) leading to the failure of the whole catalytic process.

and the analysis shows that the less positive charge of the metal Fe centre (Fe
δ
+
), as well as the electron donation of the P atom leads to the higher catalytic activity of FeN
3
P-SAzyme. Therefore, the high catalytic activity of FeN
3
P-SAzyme is a result of the synergistic effects of the Fe and P atoms.

P-SAzyme inhibits tumour cell growth in vitro and in vivo
Taking advantage of the high peroxidase-like activity of FeN
3
P-SAzyme, which could catalytically generate abundant oxidative species selectively under a tumour-acidic environment, we then employed FeN
3
P-SAzyme as an effective therapeutic strategy for tumour cell suppression. Treatment of human HepG2 hepatoma cells with FeN

3
P-SAzyme has a universal inhibiting capability for tumour cells. Treatment of 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts with FeN
3
P-SAzyme also showed a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig.

). However, this was much less compared with the effect on tumour cells (Fig.

P-SAzyme resulted in internalization of FeN
3
P-SAzyme (Fig.

) which was finally localized into the lysosome (Fig.

P-SAzyme within the tumour cells. With the internalization of FeN
3
P-SAzyme, we detected an increase in cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the fluorescent probe H
2
DCFDA as assayed by confocal microscopy (Fig.
5e
) and flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig.
43
). Importantly, ROS accumulation within FeN
3
P-SAzyme-treated cells was not substantially different with or without the addition of extra H

(Fig.

), indicating that the intracellular H

P-SAzyme-activated intracellular catalytic reaction. As expected, cotreatment with antioxidants (for example glutathione) suppressed FeN
3
P-SAzyme-induced cell death in HepG2 cells (Fig.

3
P-SAzyme, with superior peroxidase activity, induces rapid and oxidative lethality in tumour cells.
To further assess whether FeN
3
P-SAzyme exposure would inhibit tumour growth in vivo, we subcutaneously implanted 1.0 × 10
6
HepG2 hepatoma cells into the shoulders of female nude mice. FeN
3
P-SAzyme (12.5 mg per kg) was injected intratumourally into mice after the tumours reached
∼
50 mm
3
. The results showed significant tumour growth inhibition (tumour size 40.6% at 14 days post-treatment compared with controls;
P
< 0.001) in mice treated with FeN
3
P-SAzyme compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) controls (Fig.
5f
). Intravenous injection of FeN
3
P-SAzyme (12.5 mg per kg) into HepG2 tumour-bearing mice only generated a little inhibition efficacy towards tumour growth (tumour size 87.9% at 14 days post-treatment compared with controls;
P
= 0.47), mainly attributed to the lack of the tumour targeting of FeN
3
P-SAzyme. FeN
3
P-SAzyme will be more suitable for intravenous administration after conjugation with high-affinity targeting ligands. These ligands will guide FeN
3
P-SAzyme to the sites of tumours once they are in systemic circulation.
We next evaluated the in vivo toxicity of FeN
3
P-SAzyme by detecting the loss of body weight after treatment. FeN
3
P-SAzyme at 12.5 mg per kg was well tolerated with no significant weight loss compared with PBS controls during treatment (Fig.
5g
). We further assessed the biosafety of FeN
3
P-SAzyme by pathological analysis of the main organs of healthy and tumour-bearing mice after intravenous or intratumoural injection of FeN
3
P-SAzyme at different doses (Supplementary Figs.
44
and
45
). No abnormal organ pathological changes were observed in mice treated with FeN
3
P-SAzyme at the maximum dose of 20 mg per kg, verifying the safety of FeN
3
P-SAzyme treatment at the tested doses. In addition, the elimination blood half-life (
t
(1/2)β
) was found to be 290 min (Supplementary Fig.
46a
) and the majority of the dose was eliminated by the body within 96 h post-injection (Supplementary Fig.
46b
), further confirming the biosafety of FeN
3
P-SAzyme treatment at the tested doses.
Conclusions
Nanozymes are generally defined as nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme-like characteristics

,
2
,

,

,
14
. Natural enzymes contain a highly evolved atomically dispersed metal active centre and a three-dimensional amino acid structure that leads to fast reactions and high selectivities. In this Article, a single-atom nanozyme was developed with well-defined electronic and geometric structures to mimic the highly evolved catalytic centre and the high selectivity of natural enzymes. The constructed FeN
3
P-SAzyme can be considered as a peroxidase-like nanozyme because it achieved the catalytic oxidation of peroxidase substrate TMB with comparable catalytic efficiency (

). The well-constructed Fe active centre of FeN
3
P-SAzyme, through the precise coordination of P and N, mimics the single-atom Fe active centre of HRP (Fig.
1a
, Supplementary Fig.
15
) that dissociates the nearby H
2
O
2
to generate the surface species of OH and O atoms on the top site of the P atom (Fig.
4
). Uniquely, the generated OH and O atoms on the P site show a high affinity for the TMB substrate because of the formed strong hydrogen bonds (−0.44 and −0.65 eV) (Supplementary Fig.
47
). The well-engineered three-dimensional porous carbon-based nanomaterial mimics the role of the three-dimensional amino acid structure of enzymes to serve as the support to facilitate the hydrogen overflow from TMB to OH and O. This further enhances the peroxidase-like catalytic activity and substrate selectivity (Supplementary Fig.
47
).
Natural enzymes containing highly evolved metal active centres that show high catalytic activity and fast kinetics have been the ultimate goal of catalyst design. Here, we have reported that the engineered FeN
3
P-SAzyme exhibits the kinetics of the natural HRP enzyme under the same reaction conditions. The excellent catalytic performance of FeN
3
P-SAzyme contributes to its multiple advantages in synergistically enhancing its catalytic efficiency. The well-engineered single-atom Fe active sites precisely anchored by the rich doped N atoms and P atoms greatly accelerate the catalytic kinetics of FeN
3
P-SAzyme. The single-atom Fe (Fe
δ
+
) sites with less positive charge and the P atoms as electron donors in the active centre structure of FeN
3
P-SAzyme synergistically lead to low barriers of surface O formation and result in fast kinetics. The three-dimensional porous carbon-based structure of FeN
3
P-SAzyme mimics the role of the three-dimensional amino acid structure of enzymes that facilitate hydrogen overflow from TMB to the formed OH and O from H
2
O
2
dissociation. This further enhances the peroxidase-like catalytic activity and substrate selectivity of FeN
3
P-SAzyme. Together, our results represent a promising breakthrough in developing high-performance artificial enzymes and thus provide guidance for future design and development of enzymatic materials with great prospects for replacing traditional enzymes in practical applications.

Then, the as-obtained mixed solution was transferred to a sealed container and placed into a constant-temperature oven at 35 °C for 2 h. Finally, the as-obtained ZIF-8 was centrifuged, washed with methanol and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. For the synthesis of Fe/ZIF-8@PZM, 160 mg of bis(4-aminophenyl) ether and 80 mg of phosphonitrilic chloride trimer were dissolved in 50 ml methanol. Then, 200 mg of the as-obtained ZIF-8 was dispersed in 10 ml of methanol, followed by mixing homogeneously with 1 ml of 10 mg ml

Finally, the as-obtained Fe/ZIF-8@PZM was collected, washed and dried. ZIF-8@PZM was prepared with the same synthesis procedure as for Fe/ZIF-8@PZM except that Fe(NO

Characterizations
A JEOL JEM-2100F with electron acceleration energy of 200 kV was used to record the high-resolution TEM and elemental mappings. A JEM-ARM200F transmission electron microscope operated at 200 keV, equipped with a probe spherical aberration corrector, was used to obtain HAADF-STEM images of the samples. XRD (Rigaku RU-200b with Cu Kα radiation (
λ
= 1.5406 Å)) was used to obtain the crystalline structure and phase purity. Nitrogen (N

) sorption analysis was performed on an Autosorb-IQ2-MP (Quantachrome, USA) at 77 K. XPS experiments were performed using a ULVAC PHI Quantera microscope. A Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope was used to record the sizes and morphologies of the samples. The XAFS spectra at Fe K-edge was acquired at the 1W1B station in Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) and the BL11B station in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), which were operated at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA. The data for FeN

Characterization of the kinetics of nanozymes and HRP
The kinetic assays of nanozymes and HRP were carried out at 37 °C in 1.8 ml HAc–NaAc buffer (0.2 M, pH 3.6) with different concentrations of FeN

concentration was used during the nanozyme measurements than during the enzyme measurements. This was because the kinetic assay with TMB as the substrate was measured under the condition that the enzymes or nanozymes were saturated with H

P-SAzyme required a much higher H

After H

was added, various volumes of TMB solution (10 mg ml
−1
in dimethylsulfoxide) were added to the reaction mixture in various tubes. The final reaction volume was brought to 2.2 ml by addition of acetic buffer. Immediately after the substrates were added, colour reactions were recorded in time-scan mode by measuring the absorbance at 652 nm using a UV-visible spectrometer (Hitachi UV-3900). The absorbance at 652 nm against the reaction time was plotted to obtain the reaction–time curve. The initial rate of change of absorbance at 652 nm was determined by measuring the slope of the initial linear portion of the reaction–time curve. A Michaelis–Menten curve was produced by plotting the calculated initial rate against the substrate concentrations (Supplementary Fig.
18
). The Michaelis–Menten equation was fitted to the data points to determine
K

by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis using Graphpad Prism version 7 software. The value of

by the molar concentration of nanozyme or HRP.
The molar concentration of nanozymes was determined using a nanoparticle tracking analysis system (Malvern, model no. Nanosight LM14). The content of Fe in nanozymes was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (Thermo Scientific, model no. iCAP6300). The results, as well as the detailed calculation process of molar concentration of nanozymes and the number of Fe active sites in each nanozyme are listed in Supplementary Table

.
Cell viability assay
The in vitro cytotoxicity of nanozymes was determined using a CCK-8 cell viability kit assay. Briefly, HepG2 cells (from ATCC, catalog: 430641) were plated in 96-well plates with a density of 4 × 10
3
cells per well and cultured in 100 μl RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h before addition of nanozymes. On each plate, blank wells with media were defined as 0% viability and the wells with 1640-treated cells only were defined as 100% viability. Nanozymes were diluted in 1640 medium and then added into the cells. After incubation for various time periods at 37 °C, the supernatant was removed and 100 μl of 1640 medium and 10 μl of CCK-8 solution were added into each well. After incubation for another 3 h at 37 °C, the absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a Benchmark Plus microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The results presented are the average of three independent experiments.
Cellular ROS assay
A fluorescent probe, H

2
DCFDA in serum-free DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The fluorescence signals of H
2
DCFDA were measured using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus FluoView FV-1000). For flow cytometry analysis of ROS, after incubation with H
2
DCFDA, cells were measured immediately by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm.
Free radical identification
The electron spin resonance analyses were performed using a Bruker EPR A300-10/12 spectrometer at ambient temperature. Briefly, 50 μl aliquots of control or sample solution were put in glass capillary tubes with internal diameters of 1 mm and sealed. The capillary tubes were inserted into the electron spin resonance cavity and the spectra were recorded at selected times. Instrument settings were as follows: 1 G field modulation, 200 G scan range and 20 mW microwave power for detection of spin adducts using spin traps. The spin-trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide was used to verify the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH

After washing 3 times with PBS, the cells were blocked in 5% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with an anti-Lamp1 mAb (1:200) at 4 °C overnight to visualize lysosomes, then washed with PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG1 conjugated with Alexa-555 (1:500) for 45 min at 37 °C. Finally, the cell nucleus was stained with 1 μg ml

P-SAzyme for 24 h and subsequently fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde after trypsinization, rinsed in PBS and finally centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. The collected cells were fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4 at 4 °C for 2 h, subsequently dehydrated in ethanol followed by acetone and embedded in LX-112 (Ladd). Ultrathin sections (~60–80 nm) were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT (Leica) and examined under a Tecnai Spirit Bio TWIN transmission electron microscope (FEI).
Tumour therapy with FeN
3
P-SAzyme
All animal studies were performed following the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Six-week-old female BALB/c nude mice were obtained from the Beijing Vital River Laboratories. Mice were housed under standard conditions with free access to sterile food and water. To establish the HepG2 xenograft tumour model, mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 10
6
HepG2 cells in 100 μl PBS. For intratumoural injection studies, 10 female BALB/c nude mice bearing HepG2 tumours were randomly assigned to 2 groups (
n
= 5 mice per group) when the size of tumour reached about 50 mm
3
(at 8 days after tumour implantation). The tumour volume was calculated according to the formula:
V
= 0.5 ×
a
×
b
2
, where
a
represents the tumour length and
b
represents the tumour width. For the groups treated with nanozyme materials, FeN
3
P-SAzyme was intratumourally injected into HepG2 tumour-bearing mice from day 9 after tumour implantation and then once every other day. The mice treated with PBS were used as negative controls.
The tumour size and body weight were measured every other day. Measured values are presented as mean ± s.d. During treatment, mice were monitored for body weight loss and euthanized on exceeding 15% loss in body weight or if the volume of tumours was more than 1,000 mm
3
.
For biosafety analysis, 20 female BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups (
n
= 5 mice per group). Identical doses (0, 5, 10, 20 mg per kg) of FeN
3
P-SAzyme materials as intravenous injection were injected into the veins of the mice. Mice treated with PBS were used as a negative control. Mice were sacrificed on day 20 post FeN
3
P-SAzyme injection. Major organs were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, then embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm, before being stained with hematoxylin eosin.
Computational details
DFT methods
All spin polarization calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)
37
,
38
. The electron–ion interaction was described with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method
39
,
40
. The electron exchange and correlation energies were treated within the generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof formalism (GGA-PBE)
41
. The energy cutoff of the plane wave basis was set to 400 eV, an electron smearing width of
σ
= 0.2 eV was employed according to the Methfessel–Paxton technique and Monkhorst–Pack
k
-point sampling was utilized. All transition states were estimated using the climbing image nudged elastic band method
42
and stretching-frequency analysis was performed to verify whether a transition state was associated with only a single imaginary frequency. According to previous studies, the influence of electronic correlations within the GGA +
U
method was considered (
U
eff
= 4.0 eV)
43
,
44
. Furthermore, the magnetic moments of Fe
3
O
4
were treated as ferrimagnetic properties (the spins of the octahedral and tetrahedral iron atoms were set as up and down, respectively).
The adsorption energy was calculated according to
E
ads
=
E
X/slab
– (
E
slab
+
E
X
), where
E
X/slab
is the total energy of the slab with adsorbates in its equilibrium geometry,
E
slab
is the total energy of the bare slab and
E
X
is the total energy of the free adsorbates in the gas phase. Therefore, the more negative the
E
ads
, the stronger the adsorption. The barrier (
E
a
) and reaction energy (∆
E
r
) were calculated according to
E
a
=
E
TS
–
E
IS
and ∆
E
r
=
E
FS
–
E
IS
, where
E
IS
,
E
FS
and
E
TS
are the total energy of the corresponding initial state (IS), final state (FS) and transition state (TS), respectively.
DFT models
The calculated lattice constant of the Fe
3
O
4
cell was 8.397 Å, which is in agreement with the experimental value of 8.396 Å (ref.
45
). In the calculations, Fe
3
O
4
displayed ferrimagnetic behaviour and the average magnetic moments per Fe atom in the Fe
3
O
4
cell and surface were 3.53 and 3.99 µ
B
, respectively, which agree well with the experimental value of 3.68 µ
B
(ref.
46
). For FeN
3
P-SAzyme and FeN
4
-SAzyme, the magnetic moments of the Fe atoms were 1.871 and 3.873 µ
B
, respectively. In Supplementary Fig.
27
the top and side views of three catalyst models are shown, where FeN
3
P-SAzyme and FeN
4
-SAzyme represent two single atom sites of the Fe catalyst and Fe
3
O
4
(111) represents the nano catalyst of Fe
3
O
4
. The unit cell p(2 × 2) for Fe
3
O
4
(111) was chosen in the calculations and 3 × 3 × 1
k
-point sampling was used for all three models. In total, the FeN
3
P-SAzyme cell contained 54 C, 6H, 3 N, 1 P and 1 Fe atom and all the atoms were relaxed. The Fe
3
O
4
(111) cell contained 48 Fe and 64 O atoms, where 20 Fe and 16 O atoms were fixed.
