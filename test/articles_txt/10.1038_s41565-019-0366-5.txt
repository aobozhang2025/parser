Abstract
The hydrogenation activity of noble metal, especially platinum (Pt), catalysts can be easily inhibited by the presence of a trace amount of carbon monoxide (CO) in the reaction feeds. Developing CO-resistant hydrogenation catalysts with both high activity and selectivity is of great economic interest for industry as it allows the use of cheap crude hydrogen and avoids costly product separation. Here we show that atomically dispersed Pt over α-molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) constitutes a highly CO-resistant catalyst for the chemoselective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene derivatives. The Pt
1
/α-MoC catalyst shows promising activity in the presence of 5,000 ppm CO, and has a strong chemospecificity towards the hydrogenation of nitro groups. With the assistance of water, high hydrogenation activity can also be achieved using CO and water as a hydrogen source, without sacrificing selectivity and stability. The weakened CO binding over the electron-deficient Pt single atom and a new reaction pathway for nitro group hydrogenation confer high CO resistivity and chemoselectivity on the catalyst.

Main
Catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene derivatives to corresponding anilines over noble metal-based catalysts are the highly followed standard industrial protocols for the production of high value intermediates for pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications
1
,
2
. In an industrial hydrogenation process, ultrahigh purity hydrogen (over 99.99%) is required
3
to prevent the poisoning of the noble metal (especially Pt) based catalysts by the accumulated trace amount of CO impurity in the gas feed at low working temperatures
4
,
5
,
6
. It has been well documented that the strong and preferential chemisorption of CO on Pt blocks the consecutive hydrogenation active sites and causes an activity loss of up to two to three orders of magnitude
7
,
8
. However, the utilization of ultrahigh purity hydrogen obtained through the purification of crude hydrogen from hydrocarbon reforming
9
,
10
,
11
via either pressure swing adsorption
12
or palladium or polymeric membrane stacks
13
,
14
can drastically increase the cost in both infrastructure input and operation by 10–20%
15
. Based on data from the Department of Energy of the United States
16
, the sale price of ultrahigh purity hydrogen is nearly twice as much as that of crude industrial hydrogen. Therefore, developing a CO-resistant catalyst that can effectively catalyse hydrogenation reactions using crude hydrogen is not only of significant scientific importance but also economically appealing.
In previous attempts, reducing the preferential chemisorption of CO on catalysts has been the major strategy pursued. Utilizing the strong interaction between Pt and FeO
x
successfully decreased the electron density of supported Pt
17
, which limits the back-donation of
d
electrons to the CO anti-bonding orbital and effectively lowers the CO oxidation temperature in the preferential oxidation reaction of CO. By confining Pt into single atoms, the reaction temperature for CO removal via CO oxidation reaction can be further reduced to room temperature
18
,
19
,
20
. However, reducing the electron density of Pt single atoms on oxide supports is inevitably accompanied by the polarization of the Pt–substrate bonds, which is undesirable for the adsorption and dissociation of H
2
. In our recent work, we discovered that atomically dispersed Pt supported on α-MoC exhibits electron-deficient states that would effectively reduce CO adsorption
21
. Meanwhile, the Pt–Mo bond maintains the metallic properties of the Pt single atom and still makes it possible to dissociate the C–H and O–H bonds of methanol. These unique catalytic characteristics make Pt
1
/α-MoC a potential catalyst for CO-resistant hydrogenation reactions.
In addition to maintaining high hydrogenation activity in the presence of CO, significant efforts have focused on developing chemically selective nitrobenzene hydrogenation catalysts to avoid costly product separation
22
,
23
,
24
,
25
,
26
. However, it remains challenging to keep other sensitive groups, such as C–C unsaturated bonds and halogen groups such as Br
–
and I
–
, intact at high conversion rates of reactants and for prolonged reaction times when using noble metal catalysts
27
,
28
. Moreover, recent studies of gold (Au) and oxide catalysts suggest that achieving a sufficiently high reaction rate is difficult on these well-developed chemoselective catalytic systems
22
,
29
.
Here, we report that the atomically dispersed 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst is capable of catalysing the chemoselective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and its derivatives with high efficiency using crude hydrogen with different levels of CO contaminantion. The presence of the typically undesired poison CO helped the catalyst to achieve more than 99% chemoselectivity under 100% conversion in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene compounds substituted by unsaturated C–C groups, such as 3-nitrostyrene and ethynyl-nitrobenzene, even with prolonged reaction times. In addition, the catalyst could use CO and water as feeds for the hydrogenation reaction, achieving a high hydrogenation activity of over 3,460 h
−1
at room temperature. This Pt
1
/α-MoC catalyst therefore allows the use of crude hydrogen, reformate gas, and CO and water as low-cost hydrogen sources for low-temperature hydrogenation reactions with high efficiency and chemoselectivity.
CO-resistant chemoselective hydrogenation
Hydrogenation reactions of nitrobenzene and styrene to aniline and ethyl-benzene, respectively, in a solution of cyclohexane were used to evaluate the catalytic performance and anti-CO poisoning ability of Pt-based catalysts in CO-contaminated hydrogen. The α-MoC substrate itself did not efficiently catalyse the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (Supplementary Table
1
, entry 1). Commercial Pt/C catalysts have been widely proven to be highly active in the hydrogenation reactions of both N=O and C=C bonds in pure hydrogen
26
,
30
. Under the test conditions, the 0.5% Pt/C catalyst achieved over 99% nitrobenzene conversion at only 35 °C in 1.5 h (Table
1
, entry 1). However, when 1,000 ppm CO was introduced into the reactor, the commercial Pt/C catalyst was completely poisoned and no hydrogenation products were detected. Even after the reaction temperature was raised to 80 °C (Table
1
, entry 2), there was still no activity. Even the previously reported single-atom Pt
1
/FeO
x
catalyst, which is highly active for low-temperature CO oxidation
18
, could not catalyse the nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction in the presence of 1,000 ppm CO (Table
1
, entry 3). The poisoning is generally attributed to the preferential adsorption of CO on Pt and consequently the blockage of the hydrogen adsorption and dissociation sites
5
,
7
. By contrast, the 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst exhibited much better CO resistance in the nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction. Comparing the hydrogenation performance with and without a trace amount of CO in the gas feed, we found that the catalyst remained active in simulated crude hydrogen, with considerable nitrobenzene conversion (100% in p(CO) of 1,000 ppm and 22% in p(CO) of 5,000 ppm) at 35 °C (Table
1
, entries 4–6). Even at a CO concentration of 5,000 ppm, the hydrogenation activity of 0.25% Pt/α-MoC was fully recovered when the reaction temperature was increased to 70 °C (Table
1
, entry 8). Importantly, the 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst exhibited exceptional stability in an eight-cycle experiment without a noticeable loss of activity and stability (Supplementary Fig.
1
).

Full size table
For the hydrogenation of a substituted vinyl group (C=C–), the 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst was completely inactive in CO-contaminated hydrogen at 70 °C (Table
1
, entries 9 and 10), indicating that there may be different hydrogenation mechanisms or sites on the Pt/α-MoC catalyst for the vinyl and nitro groups. For example, vinyl groups tend to be significantly influenced by the chemisorbed CO at low temperature. Utilizing the different catalytic responses to a trace amount of CO in hydrogen over the Pt/α-MoC catalyst, chemoselective hydrogenation of nitro groups in unsaturated alkyl-substituted nitrobenzene compounds becomes possible. In the hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene (Table
1
, entry 12), the corresponding aniline selectivity reached over 99.9% in crude hydrogen, with over 81% conversion within 1.5 h of reaction time. Even if the reaction time was extended to 3 h after the full conversion of 4-nitrostyrene, no vinyl hydrogenation by-products were detected (Table
1
, entry 13). This excellent catalytic performance and CO resistance in the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene derivatives is rarely observed in Pt-based catalysts.
Structure and electronic properties of Pt/α-MoC
To understand the observed exceptional catalytic hydrogenation performance of the 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst, we investigated the modulation by α-MoC in the atomic and electronic structures of the Pt species using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
Z
-contrast imaging and extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy analysis. The high-resolution STEM
Z
-contrast images of 0.25% Pt/α-MoC showed that Pt is atomically dispersed on the α-MoC support (Fig.
1a,b
; Supplementary Figs.
2
and
3
). The lattice fringes and orientation suggest that the preferential exposing facet is α-MoC{111} (Fig.
1a
). The EXAFS results further revealed that Pt/α-MoC has very different structural features to those of the Pt/C catalyst (Fig.
1c
). The EXAFS fitting unravelled that the coordination number (C.N.)
Pt-Pt
of the 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst is zero, which further confirms that Pt is atomically dispersed (Supplementary Table
2
; Supplementary Fig.
4
). More importantly, the atomically dispersed Pt on 0.25% Pt/α-MoC exhibited unique electron-deficient properties. This was shown by a 0.6 eV blue shift of the Pt L
3
absorption edge and a significant increase of the ‘white-line’ intensity compared to metallic Pt foil (Fig.
1d
). This resulted from a charge redistribution at the interface of Pt and molybdenum carbide. The charge transfer from Pt to α-MoC was also confirmed by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization (Supplementary Fig.
5
).

To understand the CO resistance of the Pt/α-MoC catalyst, we performed molecular orbital theory calculations to analyse the CO adsorption behaviour. The structural models based on experimental characterization are shown in Fig.

. To evaluate the CO internal bond and CO–Pt interaction on different surface models, C- and O-projected density of states (pDOS) as well as projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP)

are presented in Fig.
1h,i
and Supplementary Fig.
6
. Compared to the case of CO adsorption on Pt(111), the delocalized molecular orbitals of CO adsorbed on Pt
1
/α-MoC(111) interact much weaker with the Pt bands in the −10 to −5 eV energy zone. Moreover, the
\(2\tilde {\mathrm{\pi}} ^ \ast\)
is in a higher energy level and less occupied, indicating weaker CO adsorption and activation
33
,
34
,
35
. The results of the orbital analysis (Supplementary Table
3
) was consistent with the computed CO adsorption energies of −2.59 and −1.46 eV on Pt(111) and Pt
1
/α-MoC(111), respectively. In brief, the interaction between the α-MoC(111) substrate and Pt atom leads to a partial charge transfer from Pt to the substrate (computed charge of +0.68
e
) and weakens the binding between CO and Pt by decreasing the back donation of the Pt atom to 2π* of CO. This in turn increases the CO resistance of the catalyst during the hydrogenation reaction.
A new reaction pathway for nitrobenzene hydrogenation
Besides the weakened binding between CO and Pt over the Pt
1
/α-MoC catalyst, density functional theory (DFT) calculations also revealed that the presence of the interface structure changes the hydrogenation reaction pathway for the nitro group. The detailed reaction pathway for nitrobenzene adsorption and N=O hydrogenation over Pt
1
/α-MoC is shown in Fig.
2
and Supplementary Fig.
7
. As shown in Fig.
2a
, the adsorption of nitrobenzene and the subsequent dissociation of both N=O double bonds to C
6
H
5
N* are thermodynamically favourable (energy barrier of 0.4 eV and 0.34 eV, respectively) on α-MoC. However, the reaction from C
6
H
5
N* to C
6
H
5
NH* needs to overcome a large energy barrier of 2.06 eV (Fig.
2b
), indicating that the direct hydrogenation of C
6
H
5
N* on bare α-MoC with active H is thermodynamically unfavourable. When Pt atoms are placed onto the α-MoC surface (that is, Pt
1
/α-MoC), even with the adsorption of CO at the Pt on-top site, the adsorption and activation of hydrogen can still proceed with a low energy barrier of 0.25 eV (Supplementary Fig.
8
). In addition, the energy barrier for C
6
H
5
N* hydrogenation decreases drastically to 1.53 eV for reaction at the Pt
1
/α-MoC(111) interface or 0.95 eV for reaction at the Pt on-top site, as shown in Fig.
2c,d
. These results therefore suggest that the Pt
1
/α-MoC catalyst is indeed active for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene via a new reaction pathway (with relatively high energy barriers) that involves both α-MoC and Pt sites. Moreover, catalysis is not strongly affected by the presence of CO, showing excellent CO resistance. This proposed new reaction pathway is directly supported by the fact that we did not observe any intermediates, based on the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of the products, even when the conversion of the substrate was lowered to less than 20%.

We further showed that by introducing water onto the catalyst surface, which can either be intentionally added in or generated during the reactions, the hydrogenation reaction can proceed much easier (Supplementary Fig.
9
). The barrier for the first hydrogenation step of C

N* on Pt

/α-MoC(111) in the presence of water decreased to 0.1 eV (Fig.

N* proceeded much easier on Pt

/α-MoC(111) than on bare α-MoC(111) (0.10 eV compared with 0.67 eV, Fig.

with water only needs to overcome an energy barrier of 0.06 eV on α-MoC (Fig.

). This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the Pt
1
/α-MoC(111) interface structure and the conducive effect of water for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene over the Pt
1
/α-MoC catalyst. In addition, CO on the Pt site can be partially eliminated through a reforming reaction with adjacent water or hydroxyl species on α-MoC
21
,
36
, which also helps the catalyst resist CO poisoning.
The crucial role of water in CO-resistant hydrogenation
Inspired by the DFT calculation results, we further evaluated the effect of water solvent on the reaction rate and chemical specificity in crude hydrogen. In an aqueous solution, the hydrogenation rate of nitro compounds was significantly increased compared to that in a non-polar solution using crude hydrogen (Table
2
, entries 1–5). The conversion of nitro compounds was 22% in cyclohexane at room temperature in hydrogen with 5,000 ppm CO impurity, while the conversion reached 100% under the same reaction condition when water was used as the solvent. To evaluate the CO resistance of the Pt/α-MoC catalyst in aqueous medium, the CO concentration in hydrogen was increased to 32% to simulate crude hydrogen from various fossil fuel reforming and gasification. In the catalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene, the Pt/α-MoC catalyst was able to maintain its excellent performance even under high CO partial pressure. The conversion stayed at 100% under different p(CO), and none of the 4-ethyl aniline by-products was detected even with prolonged reaction times (Table
2
, entry 6).

We further demonstrated that using pure CO and water as the hydrogen source, chemoselective hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene was still achievable (Table
2
, Entry 7). Previously, only Au-based catalysts have been reported to be active in similar reactions
22
,
37
(Supplementary Table
4
, entry 1). However, due to the difficulties in forming Au–H bonds, the turnover frequency (TOF) of Au-based catalysts was significantly limited by the hydrogen transfer rate from proton solvent water to the reactant (the TOF of nitrobenzene hydrogenation is generally below 100 h
−1
at room temperature, as previously reported
22
). In contrast, the hydrogenation rate over the Pt/α-MoC catalyst was as high as 3,460 h
−1
, two times higher than that of the best Pt single-atom hydrogenation catalyst reported in the literature
27
. In addition, the selective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene achieved 100% conversion and 99.9% selectivity to 3-vinyl aniline (Table
2
, entries 1 and 2). The excellent performance of 0.25% Pt/α-MoC using CO and water for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene derivatives is an advance over previously reported Au-based catalysts that are also active for this reaction (Supplementary Table
5
). Furthermore, the reaction rate is now much more appealing for industrial applications. The intrinsic hydrogenation rate of nitrobenzene in the presence of water is about 7 and 15 times higher than in organic medium with hydrogen sources containing 5,000 ppm or 32% CO, respectively. This demonstrates that Pt
1
/α-MoC plus an aqueous medium is a CO-resistant and chemoselective catalytic system for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene derivatives (Fig.
3
; Supplementary Fig.
10
).
Fig. 3: The intrinsic hydrogenation TOF rate per Pt site for nitrobenzene over the 0.5% Pt/C and 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalysts.
The measurements were performed in either cyclohexane or water at room temperature with varied CO concentrations (0–100%) in the hydrogen feed. The broken lines are provided to guide the eyes. The TOF values were measured in the kinetic region, where conversion of the substrate was kept below 20%. The error bars show the fluctuation of TOF based on three repeated experiments. The number of active Pt sites in the 0.5% Pt/C catalyst was determined from CO chemisorption.

We then extended the scope of reactant molecules to varieties of C≡C–, halogen atoms and C=O group substituted nitrobenzene (Table
3
). Traditionally, the chemoselective conversion of these substrates with highly sensitive groups is challenging when using Pt-based catalysts, as the hydrogenation of the unsaturated bonds and the hydro-dehalogenation side reactions can also be catalysed effectively by metallic Pt. Utilizing CO and water as the hydrogen source, the 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst exhibited strong chemospecificity and high activities during nitro group hydrogenation. For instance, the C≡C bond remained intact after 4 h of reaction with 100% substrate conversion (Table
3
, entries 1 and 2). In the hydrogenation of halogen substituted nitrobenzene derivatives (Table
3
, entries 4–7), no hydro-dehalogenation product was observed in fluoro- and chloro-nitrobenzene hydrogenation reactions, and the substrates were almost fully converted within 2 h (Table
3
, entries 6 and 7). Even for 4-iodonitrobenzene with a highly sensitive iodine group, the 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst was able to achieve 100% conversion and 98% selectivity in 1 h and only a small drop in selectivity (about 3% more deiodine product) occurred after another 2 h under the reaction condition. This is a highly impressive result among heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts (Table
3
, entries 4 and 5; Supplementary Table
5
). The formyl group also remained intact in the selective hydrogenation reactions (Table
3
, entry 8).

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that atomically dispersed Pt
1
/α-MoC is a highly active CO-resistant catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and derivatives to corresponding anilines. The interaction between the supported Pt atom and α-MoC leads to weakened CO adsorption on Pt sites, and the Pt
1
/α-MoC interface structure enables a new pathway for nitro group hydrogenation, which can proceed even in the presence of CO impurity. In addition, the preferential adsorption of the CO poison on the atop site of Pt single atoms effectively suppresses the unfavourable side reactions and confers the catalyst with extraordinary chemospecificity. Under this new reaction pathway, water plays an important role as the H donor and promotes catalysis. By using pure CO and water as the hydrogen source, the catalyst can achieve high activity and chemoselectivity at low temperature.

Evaluation of catalytic performance
Before the catalytic performance evaluation, the 0.25% Pt/MoC catalyst was activated in a CH
4
/H
2
mixture (15/85 v/v). First, the temperature was kept at 300 °C for 1 h and then raised to 590 °C and held for 2 h. The Pt/oxide and Ru/oxide catalysts were activated in a H
2
flow at 500 °C. After being cooled to room temperature, the activated samples were transferred into de-aerated solvent in an autoclave under the protection of Ar flow. The sealed autoclave was purged using the desired gas feed three times. The catalytic reactions were carried out at the designated temperature with a stirring speed of 1,000 r.p.m.
When using organic solvent (cyclohexane), the liquid substrate was added directly to the autoclave containing the solvent and internal standard. Cyclohexane, as a non-proton solvent, was chosen for this study to eliminate the influence of solvents containing active O–H bonds in the hydrogenation reaction. We have previously demonstrated that the Pt/α-MoC catalyst is highly active in O–H activation
21
. The solid reactants were dissolved first and then added to the solvent with the internal standard.
When using an aqueous medium, the solid substrates were dissolved with organic solvents first and then added to water. Although the reactants in the solvent may have a low solubility in water, the reaction could still happen at the interface of the water–reactant, especially under fast stirring. Indeed, the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of benzene derivatives (which also have a low solubility in water) has been reported
22
. Therefore, the low solubility of substrates should not be an influential factor.
After reaction, the cyclohexane with internal standard was added to extract the residual substrate and products from water for 15 min. The extraction time was determined by optimization experiments in which 10-, 15- and 30-min extraction times were tested.
For the product analysis, the liquid organic phase was first analysed using an Agilent 7890A-5975C GC–MS, equipped with a HP-5 column. An electron ionization mass spectrometer with a triple-axis detector was used as the detector. If no reactant and only one product was detected by GC–MS, the reaction result was denoted as 100%/>99.9% (conversion/selectivity). Otherwise, the products were further analysed using an Agilent 7820 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector to obtain precise quantification results. A calibration curve with five points of related products and substrates was established using an inlet standard method to determine the response factors. Most of the reported conversion and selectivity values are the average of at least two parallel experiments. The carbon balance of the reactions is around 92%.
The experimental conditions of the GC–MS analysis are as follows: the initial temperature of the column was set at 120 °C for 2 min, then the temperature was raised to 230 °C at a rate of 10 °C min
–1
and held for 3 min. The total running time for each injection was 16 min.
Structure characterization
XAFS analysis
Pt L
3
edge (11564 eV) XAFS spectra were measured using the BL14W beamline at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in fluorescence mode, using the Lytle detector to collect the data. Pt foil and PtO
2
(Adamas) were used as standards. Before measurement, the 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst was activated in a mixture of CH
4
and H
2
(20/80 v/v) at 590 °C for 2 h. Then, the activated XAFS samples were sealed in a chamber with Kapton windows under Ar protection in a glovebox after activation.
All XAFS spectra were processed using the IFEFFIT package
38
. The EXAFS oscillations were fitted according to back-scattering equation, using the FEFF models generated from crystal structures of MoC (Fm-3m) and Pt (Fm-3m).
XPS analysis
The XPS spectra of the activated 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst were collected using an Axis Ultra Imaging Photoelectron Spectrometer (Kratos Analytical). The passivated 0.25% Pt/α-MoC catalyst was made into a small pellet (7 mm in diameter), clamped on a copper sample holder, and transferred into the pretreatment chamber of the XPS spectrometer. The pellet of catalyst was activated in the pretreatment chamber under a 20 ml min
–1
flow of CH
4
/H
2
(15/85 v/v) mixture at 1 atm, 590 °C for 2 h. After pumping out the pretreatment chamber, the sample was then transferred directly into the ultrahigh vacuum chamber for XPS measurement at room temperature without exposure to air. The XPS spectra were processed using CasaXPS software.
Electron microscopy
STEM characterization was performed on an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV
39
. The convergence angle was set to 30 mrad, while the inner angle of the annular dark-field detector was set to 86 mrad to obtain atomic number contrast (
Z
-contrast) in the images. The catalyst samples for STEM analysis were prepared by dry dispersing the catalyst powders directly onto TEM grids inside a glovebox under the protection of Ar and without vacuum baking. Thin samples were also prepared by first embedding the catalyst powers into resin and then slicing into electron-transparent TEM specimens using a microtome. The STEM results obtained from samples prepared by these two different methods are qualitatively the same.
DFT calculations
All spin polarization calculations were performed using the plane wave-based periodic DFT method as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package
40
,
41
. The electron–ion interaction was described using the projector augmented wave method
42
,
43
. The electron exchange and correlation energies were treated within the generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional
44
. The energy cut-off of the plane wave basis was set to 450 eV. An electron smearing width of
σ
= 0.2 eV was used via the Methfessel–Paxton technique to speed up the convergence of the metallic systems. All transition states were estimated using the climbing image nudged elastic band method
45
, and we analysed the stretching frequencies to characterize whether a stationary point is a minimum state without imaginary frequency or a transition state with only one imaginary frequency.
The adsorption energy was calculated according to
E
ads
=
E
X/slab
− [
E
slab
+
E
X
], where E
X/slab
is the total energy of the slab with adsorbates in its equilibrium geometry,
E
slab
is the total energy of the bare slab, and
E
X
is the total energy of the free adsorbates in the gas phase. Therefore, the more negative the
E
ads
, the stronger the adsorption. The barrier (
E
a
) and reaction energy (∆
E
r
) were calculated according to
E
a
=
E

−
E
IS
and ∆
E
r
=

−
E

, where
E
IS
,

FS
and
E
TS
are the total energies of the corresponding initial state (IS), final state (FS) and transition state (TS), respectively.
The calculated lattice constant of a cubic MoC cell (fcc) is 4.3318 Å (experimental value is 4.270 Å), and the Mo–Mo bond length is 3.063 Å. In this work, the same unit cells p(4 × 4) for α-MoC(111) and Pt
1
/α-MoC(111) surfaces were used to assess the elementary steps involved in chemoselective hydrogenation, and the 3 × 3 × 1 k-point sampling was set for them. In total, three Mo-atom layers and three C-atom layers overlaid in an alternate manner (16 atoms per layer) were used for α-MoC(111), and one Pt atom was adsorbed on α-MoC, forming the Pt
1
/α-MoC(111). The Pt coverage was 1/16. During these simulations, the atoms in the bottom three layers of these two models were fixed, while the other atoms were allowed to move freely.
