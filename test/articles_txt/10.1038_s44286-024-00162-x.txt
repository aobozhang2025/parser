Abstract
Supported noble metal cluster catalysts provide the advantages of high atom efficiency and size-dependent properties, but their stabilization remains a major challenge for industrial applications. Now we report an approach for the stabilization of nuclearity-controlled platinum nanoclusters with a typical diameter of ~0.7 nm (Pt
7−14
) confined on CeO
x
nanoislands on a porous silica support. The clusters were synthesized by the reduction of platinum single atoms on the islands in H
2
at 400 °C. Redox cycles led to cluster formation and breakup at hundreds of degrees Celsius, with platinum remaining confined to the respective islands. The clusters maintained their nuclearity and were resistant to sintering in H
2
at temperatures of ≤600 °C and atmospheric pressure. Experimental catalyst performance data bolstered by computational results demonstrate that these platinum clusters are more active than mononuclear platinum, also exhibiting higher steady-state activity than larger and smaller platinum clusters for ethylene hydrogenation.

Main
Chemical engineers have long been fascinated by catalyst design, the subject of an earlier book
1
addressing design criteria including structure and bonding in supported metals and the roles of kinetics and transport and the concepts of shape-selective catalysis by zeolites. Another book
2
addresses the distributions of metals in porous catalyst supports, presenting criteria for optimizing catalytic activity and selectivity when intrapore transport resistances markedly affect catalyst performance. Examples include core–shell catalysts, a topic of intense current interest for a wide range of potential applications
3
,
4
. A recent perspective addressed ‘nested’ metal catalysts consisting of nanostructures on supports designed to keep the metals dispersed and accessible to reactants
5
. Less widely discussed, however, are designs for optimizing supported metals for catalyst stability.
We now report a design strategy for stabilizing metal clusters by nesting on supports, applied to noble metals for catalytic hydrogenation. Supported noble metals are applied in many processes involving hydrogen activation, often at high pressure. Hydrogen is activated on surfaces having neighboring metal centers, typically in metal nanoparticles
6
. These metals are expensive, providing motivation for using them in highly dispersed forms—as few-atom clusters that expose almost all the metal atoms

,

,
16
,
17
,
18
. These clusters have properties distinct from those of typical nanoparticles, determined by the metal oxidation state, cluster nuclearity and local bonding environment, including metal–support interactions, all of which influence their interactions with reactants and reaction intermediates
7
,
13
.
Noble metal clusters on typical supports are unstable, prone to sintering, especially under reducing conditions, with the loss of accessible sites and catalytic activity
19
,
20
,
21
. This limitation has motivated researchers to design catalysts that stabilize the clusters by supporting them on reducible metal oxides
11
, metal carbides
12
and defective carbons
14
. These supports may hinder metal sintering under mild conditions, but they do not prevent it under harsh industrial hydrogenation conditions.
Here we propose a nesting strategy for preparing few-atom noble metal clusters that have nuclearities controlled by the metal loading and that are robust and stabilized in their nests but still accessible to reactants, under forcing hydrogenation conditions. The clusters are synthesized on cerium oxide (CeO
x
) nanoislands on a commercial high-area porous silica support
22
. Each nested metal cluster is, thus, isolated in a nanoreactor in which the metal atoms are confined during pretreatments and catalytic operation.
Because of its catalytic importance, we chose platinum as the active metal. We report how atom-precise low-nuclearity (Pt
7−14
) clusters are synthesized from platinum single atoms in the nests and show that the clusters resist sintering, maintaining their nuclearity under harsh reaction conditions in H
2
atmospheres. To compare the catalytic properties of the platinum clusters with those of atomically dispersed platinum (from which the clusters are formed), we used ethylene hydrogenation as a test reaction
9
,
13
. The data show that CeO
x
-island-stabilized Pt
7–14
clusters operated with no evident deactivation in a flow reactor for 176 h, being more active than the atomically dispersed platinum as well as exhibiting higher steady-state catalytic activity than larger and smaller platinum clusters
15
. The nested clusters resisted sintering even in H
2
at 600 °C, and we posit that they constitute a step toward industrial applications of low-nuclearity metal cluster catalysts.
Results
Synthesis and structural characterization of catalysts
Atomically dispersed platinum on CeO
x
islands on SiO
2
powder was synthesized as before
22
. Low-magnification high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images give evidence of the CeO
x
islands having nearly 2 nm diameters dispersed on SiO
2
(Supplementary Fig.
1
)
22
. Platinum loading, determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, was 0.5 wt%. Cl 2
p
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the initial catalyst, namely, Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
(Supplementary Fig.
2
), show that water washing and calcination removed essentially all of the chlorine that was introduced with the platinum salt precursor
22
,
23
,
24
. Broad X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate small CeO
x
crystallites of the cubic fluorite structure (Supplementary Fig.
3
)
22
, and give no evidence of platinum, consistent with its high dispersion.
The platinum species in the samples were investigated with HAADF-STEM, and the as-synthesized Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
samples were subjected to reduction in H
2
at 400 °C (giving Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED) followed by oxidation in air at 600 °C (giving Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-OX). Although isolated platinum atoms distributed on bulk CeO
2
supports with flat local facets can be imaged using HAADF-STEM
25
, those on our defective CeO
x
nanoislands could not be imaged (Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.
4a
), because the nanoislands lack many facets comparable to those on bulk CeO
2
, and they are highly sensitive to an electron beam
22
. Nonetheless, we observed the larger species, namely, platinum clusters, in Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED, by using double-aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM (Fig.
1b,d–i
and Supplementary Fig.
4b,d–i
). The images show that the clusters had a typical diameter of about 0.7 nm; importantly, the images show that they were restricted to the CeO
x
islands. Because these ultrasmall clusters are highly fluxional, we were not able to resolve their atomic structures or discern how they interacted with the CeO
x
nanoislands. The images of the sample oxidized at 600 °C, Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-OX (Fig.
1c
and Supplementary Fig.
4c
), show CeO
x
islands without the evidence of platinum clusters on them (or on the neighboring SiO
2
), indicating that the clusters broke up by oxidation at 600 °C and demonstrating the reversibility of the aggregation/fragmentation process, with the platinum confined during the changes by the nanoislands. No notable changes in the CeO
x
islands after these reversible transformations were observed in the STEM and XRD experiments (Supplementary Figs.
1
and
3
).

X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy provided evidence of the electronic structure and oxidation state of platinum
23
. The platinum L
3
-edge XANES data (Fig.
2a
) match the reported results
22
, showing that the oxidation state of platinum in the as-synthesized Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
is close to that of Pt
4+
in the reference compound PtO
2
and markedly different from that of Pt
2+
in the reference compound Pt(acac)
2
(acac, acetylacetonato) and Pt
0
in platinum foil. In contrast, the oxidation state of the H
2
-reduced platinum present as clusters is close to that of Pt
0
in a platinum foil reference. The local structures of platinum were further investigated by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy (Fig.
2b,c
, Supplementary Figs.
5
and
6
and Supplementary Tables
1
and
2
). The best-fit model characterizing Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
includes a Pt–O scattering path with a coordination number (CN) of 6.1 ± 0.5 and a bonding distance of 1.99 ± 0.01 Å, consistent with site-isolated platinum on a metal oxide
26
and implying that Pt
4+
was present in six-coordinate octahedral geometry, with no evidence of a Pt–Pt scattering path, consistent with the absence of metallic platinum (Fig.
2b
, Supplementary Fig.
6a
and Supplementary Table
2
). In contrast, the sample reduced in flowing H
2
at 400 °C for 1 h was characterized by a Pt–Pt scattering path with a CN of 4.6 ± 0.5 and a Pt–Pt bonding distance of 2.64 ± 0.01 Å (without evidence of a Pt–O scattering path), indicating that low-nuclearity metallic platinum clusters formed (Fig.
2c
, Supplementary Fig.
6b
and Supplementary Table
2
) in the reduction, consistent with the STEM images
27
. This conclusion was confirmed by the XPS results (Fig.

Structural evolution characterized by spectroscopy and density functional theory
In situ high-energy-resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD)-XANES (providing higher energy resolution than conventional XANES), as well as conventional X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), was used to track the transformation of site-isolated platinum into clusters when Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
was exposed to 10% H
2
in helium at various temperatures (Fig.
3a
, Supplementary Figs.
10
–
12
and Supplementary Table
5
)
32
. The HERFD-XANES data recorded at increasing temperatures (Fig.
3a
) indicate a markedly decreasing white-line intensity, confirming platinum reduction. Correspondingly, the conventional in situ XANES data show that the platinum white-line intensity decreased during reduction at 100 °C, approaching a value close to that of Pt
2+
in Pt(acac)
2
(Supplementary Fig.
10
)
33
. The oxidation state of platinum decreased as the reduction temperature increased to 200 °C, 300 °C and then 400 °C, as the platinum white-line intensity approached that of Pt
0
in platinum foil
27
,
32
. The corresponding in situ EXAFS data correspondingly demonstrate the transformation of site-isolated platinum into clusters (Supplementary Figs.

and

and Supplementary Table

)
33
, a result confirmed by DRIFTS of adsorbed CO (Supplementary Fig.

Further insight into the coordination environments of the isolated platinum atoms and clusters was determined using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. On the basis of the EXAFS results, the site-isolated platinum in the initially formed Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
was at first approximated as having a six-coordinate octahedral geometry, a Pt
1
O
6
configuration, on a CeO
2
(111) slab (Fig.

)
34
,
35
. The oxidation state of isolated platinum in this configuration determined from a Bader charge analysis (
q
Bader
= +1.36|
e
|; Supplementary Table
6
)
35
is close to that of Pt
4+
, consistent with the XANES data. The EXAFS CN (CN

H with Pt
2+
coordinated to four support oxygen atoms and one hydroxyl group (Fig.

35
is the one structure that agrees closely with the experimental results characterizing the mildly reduced sample (that exposed to H
2
at 100 °C; Supplementary Fig.
14
and Supplementary Table
6
).
To formulate the plausible structures of the platinum clusters in Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED, we built a comprehensive library of clusters having nuclearities ranging from 2 to 20 on the support, again represented as CeO
2
(111)—including more than 100 structures (Fig.
3c
, Supplementary Fig.
15
and Supplementary Table
7
)
36
. We screened the candidate clusters in a multidimensional probability analysis (Fig.
3c,d
and Supplementary Fig.
15
). The most important screening criteria were CN
Pt–Pt
and the stability measured by cohesion energy (
E
coh
) of the clusters with a given nuclearity.
E
coh
indicates the thermodynamic tendency for the conversion of isolated platinum atoms in the gas phase into platinum clusters on CeO
2
. The results exclude platinum clusters with nuclearities in the range of 2–6, because the values of CN
Pt–Pt
are <3.5, regardless of their configuration. Correspondingly, the STEM images show that the platinum clusters have three-dimensional shapes and not raftlike or monolayer structures. Furthermore, the CN
Pt–Pt
values do not agree with the other experimental results. Moreover, the relatively high
E
coh
values (for example, approximately –4.2 eV for Pt
3
) demonstrate that these clusters are less stable on CeO
2
than platinum clusters with higher nuclearity (Fig.
3d
and Supplementary Fig.
15
). An essential result is that the platinum clusters with nuclearities of 7–14, with the predicted CN
Pt–Pt
values of 4.0–5.1 (Fig.
3d
), are consistent with the EXAFS-determined CN
Pt–Pt
and the diameters determined by the HAADF-STEM images. With cluster nuclearities of >14, the
E
coh
values were found to decrease gradually with increasing nuclearity, with slightly increasing cluster stability, but the values of CN
Pt–Pt
became >5.6 (that is, greater than the EXAFS values). They were, therefore, not considered further.
In summary, the computational results characterizing the Pt
7−14
clusters with relatively low
E
coh
values agree well with all the experimental results characterizing Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED.
Catalyst performance in ethylene hydrogenation
The catalytic performance of the sample initially present as as-synthesized Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
(with platinum initially present as isolated Pt
4+
) was compared with that of Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED (incorporating the clusters). The experiments were performed with a once-through plug-flow reactor. The feed partial pressures (in mbar) were 100 (for H
2
), 100 (for ethylene) and 800 (for helium). The catalyst mass was 12 mg, and the total feed flow rate was 40 ml (normal temperature and pressure (NTP)) min
–1
.
The support CeO
x
/SiO
2
alone lacked measurable activity under our conditions, independent of whether it had been exposed to H
2
under the conditions used for Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED (Supplementary Fig.
16
). The platinum-containing samples were catalytically active, with ethane being the only observed product. Initially, the conversion observed with each catalyst changed during a break-in period, corresponding to changes in the ligands on platinum and/or its oxidation state as the catalyst adjusted to the reactant composition. The Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
and Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED catalysts approached steady-state operation after roughly 50 h on stream, at 70 °C and at 40 °C, respectively, showing no significant deactivation at longer times on stream (176 h; Supplementary Fig.
17
). The conversions were chosen to be low (<5%) and differential (Supplementary Fig.
18
), determining steady-state turnover frequency (TOF) values—rates per exposed platinum atom. The average fraction of platinum atoms exposed by clusters with nuclearities of 7–14 was approximately 0.97, as determined from the DFT models (Supplementary Table
7
). No measurable ethylene conversion was detected with atomically dispersed platinum at 40 °C, and, therefore, the experiments were done at 70 °C—a temperature low enough to prevent detectable changes in activity with time on stream after the break-in period.
The steady-state TOF characterizing the catalyst initially present as Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
at 70 °C was 0.096 ± 0.004 s
−1
, and that characterizing Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED at 40 °C was 0.13 ± 0.01 s
−1
(Fig.
4a,b
). The sample with platinum redispersed by oxidative cluster fragmentation, Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-OX, was tested in separate experiments at 70 °C for 176 h, establishing stable operation with the abovementioned feed. The TOF of 0.091 ± 0.007 s

matches the value for the as-synthesized Pt/CeO

and confirms the reversibility of the redox cycle (Supplementary Fig.

). To provide more insight into the active species and a further check of the catalyst stabilities, we made XAS measurements of the working catalysts in a flow reactor/cell (Fig.
4d–f
, Supplementary Fig.
20
and Supplementary Table
8
)
24
,
33
. The XANES data characterizing the catalyst initially present as Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
, recorded as the cell was fed with H
2
/ethylene/helium at 70 °C, were recorded during the break-in period, continuing until the spectra remained essentially unchanged. The white-line intensity characterizing the working catalyst at 70 °C attained a value close to that of Pt
2+
(in Pt(acac)
2
) and much less than that of Pt
4+
(in PtO
2
), becoming markedly less than that of the fresh sample and indicating the reduction of platinum by the reactants (Fig.
4d
). Correspondingly, the EXAFS results characterizing the working catalyst under the same conditions include only a Pt–O scattering path, with a CN of 5.1 ± 0.4 and a bonding distance of 2.00 ± 0.01 Å—without measurable platinum sintering, as shown by the lack of a Pt–Pt scattering path (Fig.
4e
, Supplementary Fig.
20a
and Supplementary Table
8
). These results show that reaction with ethylene + H
2
led to the removal of oxygen-containing ligands from platinum, reducing the CN of the Pt–O scattering path and opening sites for the bonding of reactants and the onset of catalysis
37
. These results agree with the configuration of the DFT-optimized model Pt
1
O
5
H (Fig.
3b
) and point to reduced site-isolated platinum, predominantly in the form of Pt
2+
species, as the catalytically active sites—a conclusion bolstered by CO adsorption DRIFTS data characterizing the used Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
catalyst (Supplementary Fig.
21
)
31
.
Contrasting data were obtained, as expected, when the catalyst initially contained Pt
7−14
clusters. The XANES data collected before and during catalysis at 40 °C with the abovementioned feed (Fig.
4d
) show that the oxidation state of platinum remained unchanged. The results are in line with the EXAFS data characterizing this sample during catalysis at 40 °C, which are represented by one Pt–Pt scattering path, with a CN of 4.9 ± 0.7 at a bonding distance of 2.65 ± 0.01 Å. These values are close to those of the initial sample before catalysis and show that the clusters were stable, resisting agglomeration, and indicating that they were the catalytically active species for ethylene hydrogenation (Fig.
4d,f
, Supplementary Fig.
20b
and Supplementary Table
8
).
The differences in platinum structure and oxidation state in the two forms of catalyst are reflected in the performance data (Fig.
4a–c
); they differ markedly in terms of both TOF and apparent activation energy of the reaction (Fig.
4c
). The apparent activation energy characterizing the platinum clusters was found to be 85 ± 6 kJ mol
−1
and that characterizing the site-isolated platinum was 106 ± 2 kJ mol
−1
. Extrapolating the data for the former on the Arrhenius plot to 25 °C, we see that the TOF characterizing the platinum clusters is approximately 70 times that characterizing the site-isolated platinum.
Ethylene hydrogenation mechanism
We performed DFT calculations to elucidate the mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation catalyzed by CeO
2
-supported platinum with various nuclearities (Fig.
5
and Supplementary Figs.
22
–
24
and
26
–
31
). The H
2
dissociation on CeO
2
-supported platinum catalysts was considered first (Fig.
5a
). Molecular hydrogen is weakly adsorbed on Pt
1
O
5
H (
E

0.01 eV) and dissociated to give one hydrogen on platinum and another on a nearby lattice oxygen atom through heterolytic cleavage, with an activation barrier of 0.19 eV (Fig.
5a
and Supplementary Fig.
22
)
6
,
38
,
39
. On representative Pt
7−14
clusters, H
2
is preferentially dissociated homolytically and spontaneously with much more negative dissociative adsorption energies (
E
ads
= –1.01 to –1.77 eV; Fig.
5a
and Supplementary Fig.
24
). In the calculations, we chose the corner or edge sites in the second or third layer of the clusters as the likely active sites, as hydrogen is most stably adsorbed on the low-coordinated and nearly neutral sites, consistent with the phenomena characterizing other subnanometer clusters (for example, Au
13
/TiO
2
and Ru
10
/TiO
2
)
40
,
41
. The more energetically favorable path of H
2
activation on supported platinum clusters was confirmed by the results of hydrogen–deuterium exchange experiments in the reaction of H
2
with D
2
(Supplementary Fig.
25
)
42
. HD formation involving hydrogen adsorption and dissociation was observed only at a higher temperature, namely, 70 °C, on the Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
catalyst, whereas it occurred at markedly lower temperatures (25 °C and 40 °C) on Pt/CeO

= –0.44 eV) and interacts with the adsorbed hydrogen on lattice oxygen adjacent to platinum, with an activation barrier of 1.03 eV (Fig.
5b
). The resultant ethyl intermediate (*C
2
H
5
) is further hydrogenated by the co-adsorbed H* on platinum to produce *C
2
H
6
with a much higher activation barrier of 1.65 eV (Fig.
5b
)
38
. In contrast, on Pt
10
(a representative example of the clusters), ethylene is preferentially and strongly adsorbed by π-bonding on a non-oxidized and low-coordinated platinum edge site with an adsorption energy of –1.60 eV, which is much lower than that on Pt
1
O
5
H (Fig.
5a
). Then, the first and second hydrogenation steps of adsorbed ethylene on Pt
10
occur sequentially, with activation barriers of 0.85 eV and 0.89 eV, respectively, indicating the higher catalytic activity of Pt
10
than that of Pt
1
O
5
H, consistent with experiment (Fig.
5b
). Thus, the results show that, affected by the various types of dissociated hydrogen (H*) and C
2
H
4
* species, the hydrogenation pathways of ethylene on Pt
1
O
5
H and Pt
7−14
are markedly different from each other.
Moreover, the relatively low- and high-nuclearity clusters Pt
3
and Pt
18
, as well as the platinum(111) surface (Supplementary Figs.
26
–
28
), were evaluated for ethylene hydrogenation. Although the strength of adsorption of ethylene is enhanced on Pt
3
(CN
Pt–Pt
= 2 and
E
ads
= –2.30 eV; Fig.
5a
), the activation barriers increase to 1.23 eV for the first hydrogenation step and to 1.21 eV for the second (Supplementary Fig.
26
). The adsorption strength of C
2
H
5
* also decreases the C–C bond dissociation barrier from 1.45 eV on Pt
10
to 1.05 eV on Pt
3
(Supplementary Fig.
29
), implying that these lower-nuclearity clusters might cause side reactions such as the deposition of carbonaceous material. Further, on Pt
18
(CN
Pt–Pt
= 6), ethylene prefers di-σ adsorption on platinum pair sites, with the adsorption energy of –1.24 eV (Fig.
5a
), and the activation barriers increase to 1.06 eV and 0.94 eV (Supplementary Fig.
27
). On platinum(111), the adsorption energy of C
2
H
4
is only –1.12 eV (Fig.
5a
), and the activation barriers of hydrogenation are 0.76 eV and 0.82 eV (Supplementary Fig.
28
), slightly lower than that on Pt
10
. The results indicate that the adsorption characterizing the reactants on Pt
10
facilitates the highest hydrogenation activity among the clusters investigated. The adsorption energies of the reactants on other platinum clusters (with nuclearities in the range of 7–14) were also evaluated, with the results indicating approximate agreement with those determined for Pt
10
(Supplementary Fig.
24
).
Further, to focus on the effect of the size of the supported subnanometer platinum clusters on the intrinsic hydrogenation activity, DFT calculations were performed to take into account only two adsorbed H atoms, corresponding to a low hydrogen-coverage regime. The influence of surface hydrogen coverage on the abnormal hydrogen adsorption and spillover from supported small metal clusters to metal oxide sites and the resulting oxygen vacancies were reported in earlier studies
41
,
43
,
44
. Therefore, at a low hydrogen coverage, combining the atom utilization of platinum and the calculated apparent energy barriers, it is reasonable to expect that Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED containing Pt
7−14
clusters with intermediate coordination and high atom utilization (~97%) exhibits high ethylene hydrogenation activity
15
.
To further explore the electronic properties of the catalysts, we calculated the projected density of states (Fig.
5c
and Supplementary Fig.
31
). As the adsorption and activation of ethylene require that the π* antibonding orbital of the C=C bond accepts an electron from the platinum
d
orbital, the double bond is more easily weakened when the
d
-band center is closer to the Fermi level
45
,
46
. In the Pt
1
O
5
H configuration
47
,
48
, the
d
-orbital center of a single platinum atom is about –1.9 eV. However, owing to the five surrounding oxygen atoms, the
d
orbital of the original metallic platinum is mainly split into two parts: the left is the bonding area associated with
p
–
d
hybridization between platinum and oxygen, and the right includes the corresponding antibonding state (Fig.
5c
)
46
. Thus, there are no
d
electrons for the efficient adsorption of reactants. Conversely, the
d
bands of the supported platinum clusters are broad, without evident energy splitting (Fig.
5c
). The
d
-band center of Pt
10
is calculated to be –2.2 eV, indicating the stronger adsorption of reactants and intermediates on Pt
10
than on Pt
18
(–2.3 eV) and metallic platinum(111) (–2.4 eV), consistent with the calculated adsorption energies and abovementioned pathways (Fig.
5a,b
and Supplementary Figs.
27
and
28
). The
d
-band center characterizing Pt
3
is calculated to be –1.9 eV, closer to the Fermi level than that of Pt
7−14
(Supplementary Fig.
31
), suggesting the much stronger adsorption of intermediates that might cause side reactions (for example, resulting in carbonaceous species), matching the conclusion stated above (Supplementary Fig.
29
)
45
,
46
,
49
.
To provide an experimental check on the prediction of the relationship between cluster nuclearity and activity in ethylene hydrogenation, catalysis experiments were conducted with CeO
x
/SiO
2
-supported platinum clusters that were relatively small (approximately Pt
4
, on average) and those that were relatively large (approximately Pt
17
, on average)—synthesized by tuning the platinum loadings (Supplementary Figs.
32
–
34
). Under the same reaction conditions, the catalyst with clusters of intermediate nuclearity, namely, Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED (Pt
7−14
), was found to have the highest steady-state TOF value among the three catalysts, consistent with the results of the DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig.
35
).
Testing for limits of catalyst stability
To assess the potential of our catalyst for industrial hydrogenation reactions under harsh conditions, we evaluated the structural stability of the confined platinum clusters under various reductive reaction conditions (Supplementary Table
9
and Supplementary Figs.
36
–
40
) in a flow reactor. When the temperature was <600 °C and at atmospheric pressure with the catalyst in flowing H
2
, the average nuclearity of the platinum clusters remained unchanged within the uncertainty of our HAADF-STEM images and CO adsorption DRIFTS data; that is, the Pt
7−14
clusters remained intact, with a typical diameter of about 0.7 nm (Supplementary Figs.
37a
and
38
). Equivalent results were obtained with the catalyst at 400 °C in the presence of 2.0 MPa of 10% H
2
/helium (Supplementary Fig.
37c
).
As a further stability check, the catalyst was used in a batch slurry reactor for
n
-hexadecane hydrocracking at 260 °C with a H
2
partial pressure of 3.0 MPa; the reaction time was 6 h (Supplementary Fig.
41
). Because platinum alone is not a good hydrocracking catalyst, it was used in a mixture with acidic particles, namely, HY zeolite. The catalyst performance data are shown in Supplementary Fig.
41
, and the used catalyst particles were characterized by DRIFTS with CO as a probe and by STEM imaging, with the results giving no evidence of platinum sintering under these typical hydrocracking conditions (Supplementary Fig.
42
).
To still further test the stability limits of the catalyst, reduction experiments were done at atmospheric pressure at 700 °C and 800 °C, as well as at 600 °C in the presence of 2.0 MPa of 10% H
2
/helium. The results show that under these harsher reductive conditions, the CeO
x
nanoislands on silica lost integrity, and—without their nests—the platinum clusters sintered to form larger platinum particles (diameter, >1 nm; Supplementary Figs.
37b
,
39
and
40
). These results demonstrate the stability limits of the supported metal cluster catalyst and identify the structural limitation—when the CeO
x
nanoislands collapse, the catalyst reaches its demise.
Conclusions
By tuning the platinum loading on CeO
x
nanoisland nests on silica, the nuclearity of the platinum clusters in these nests was controlled, with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 nm. The experimental and computational results show that the conversion of platinum single atoms into 7–14-atom clusters on CeO
x
nanoislands on SiO
2
gives an ethylene hydrogenation catalyst that is more active than the isolated platinum cations. Further, the Pt
7−14
clusters have higher steady-state activity than larger and smaller clusters. When the isolated platinum ions and clusters were reversibly interconverted in redox cycles, the metal remained confined in the nests. To investigate the potential of the nested cluster catalyst for industrial hydrogenation reactions under harsh conditions, its structural stability was investigated under harsh conditions in flowing H
2
, with the results showing that the average cluster nuclearity remained unchanged when the temperature was below 600 °C at atmospheric pressure.

XAS
XAS was performed at beamlines 4-1 and 15-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. Conventional data were collected at beamline 4-1; this is a side station on a 20-pole wiggler beamline. The ring (SPEAR3) was operated in the top-off mode; the storage ring energy was 3 GeV and the stored current was 500 mA. To minimize harmonics at the platinum L
3
edge, the double-crystal Si(220) monochromator was detuned by 20%–30% of the maximum intensity. Ex situ spectra were collected in the fluorescence yield mode with a 30-element germanium solid-state detector array. The samples were pressed into pellets and mounted on a plate, and the data were recorded at room temperature. In operando XAS experiments were done with approximately 40 mg samples loaded in a tubular flow-through quartz cell (inside diameter, 2.8 mm) through which the treatment gases flowed
24
.
HERFD-XANES experiments were performed at beamline 15-2, which is equipped with a 56-pole, 0.9 T wiggler and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled double-crystal Si(311) monochromator for selection of the incident-beam energy. A Rowland circle spectrometer having a radius of 1 m and equipped with three spherically bent Si(800) analyzers and a silicon drift detector were used to select the platinum L
α
emission line
50
. In each HERFD-XANES experiment, an approximately 40 mg sample was loaded in the flow-through cell that was fed with the treatment gas.
ATHENA and ARTEMIS software
51
were used to analyze the EXAFS data. Data alignment, edge calibration, deglitching, normalization and background subtraction were performed with ATHENA. The platinum L
3
edge energy was determined by the first inflection point of the absorption edge data characterizing a platinum-foil reference, calibrated to the reported energy of 11,564.0 eV. Data fitting was performed considering
k
1
,
k
2
and
k
3
weightings. The fitting ranges in
k
space and
R
space in the data analysis for each sample were determined by the data quality. These values were used with the Nyquist theorem for the estimation of the justified number of fitting parameters, which was not exceeded in the reported fits. The amplitude reduction factor,
S
0
2
, was determined by fitting the experimental platinum-foil data, and then fixed for further analysis of the data characterizing the various samples (Supplementary Fig.
5
and Supplementary Table

). The parameters characterizing the local structure environment including the CN, scattering path distance between the absorber and backscattering atoms (
R
), mean square relative displacement (Δ
σ
2
, disorder term) and inner potential correction (Δ
E
0
) were allowed to vary in the fitting. Various plausible models were considered in the fitting. The quality of fit was determined by the minimization of the R factor.
Standard procedures were used in the analysis of the XANES data
51
.
STEM
HAADF-STEM imaging was performed with an aberration-corrected JEOL ARM-200F microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and an image resolution of 0.08 nm in the HAADF imaging mode and, separately, with a double-aberration-corrected Themis Z microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV and an image resolution of 0.06 nm. The catalyst powders were loaded on lacey-carbon-coated copper transmission electron microscopy grids, and low electron probe currents were used to reduce the electron-beam-induced effects.
Infrared spectroscopy
A Bruker IFS 66v spectrometer (equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT) detector) and a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT-A) detector) were used to collect the DRIFTS data characterizing the powder samples. The spectral resolution was 4 cm
−1
. The cell was partly filled with approximately 50 mg of inert KBr powder, followed by adding approximately 10 mg of catalyst packed onto the KBr. The cell was connected into a flow system that allowed the recording of spectra as the reactant gases (CO (10% in helium, Airgas), helium (Praxair, UHP grade),
13
CO (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 99.5%), ethylene (Airgas, UHP grade) and/or H

(Airgas, UHP grade)) flowed through the cell at the desired temperature. The background spectra were recorded at room temperature for the as-synthesized Pt/CeO

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
The platinum loading of each catalyst sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, performed using a Thermo Scientific XSERIES 2 instrument.
XPS measurements
The XPS measurements were performed with a K-Alpha Plus XPS/UPS analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1,486.6 eV) with the samples placed in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber. The system reached a stable pressure, typically in the mid 10
−10
torr range, after ~12 h without the sample, or in the 10
−8
torr range with the sample present. Samples were mounted on conductive silver tape. A vacuum transfer module was used to transfer samples directly from a glove box to the XPS chamber without air exposure. A flood gun was used during the measurements to dynamically compensate for sample charging. A step size of 0.1 eV and a pass energy of 50 eV were used for each spectrum. The spectra were calibrated by setting the Si 2
p
signal of SiO
2
to 103.4 eV (ref.
52
). CasaXPS software version 2.3.25 was used for further data calibration and processing.
XRD crystallography
XRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a Philips X’Pert Pro Super diffractometer, equipped with a monochromatized Cu Kα radiation source at a wavelength of 0.1542 nm.
Ethylene hydrogenation catalysis in a conventional flow reactor
Ethylene hydrogenation catalysis experiments were done with a once-through temperature-controlled tubular plug-flow reactor (inside diameter, 4 mm) at various temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The products were analyzed with an online Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 50 m × 0.53 mm PLOT Alumina ‘M’ capillary column. Samples of the catalyst (Pt/CeO

and Pt/CeO

particles were loaded into the reactor, with the upstream and downstream sections packed with quartz wool. The catalyst masses were 12 mg and 6 mg for 0.3 wt% Pt/CeO
x
/SiO

x

-RED, respectively, and the catalyst powders were mixed with 500 mg of inert non-porous α-Al

powders. In these catalysis experiments, the feed was a mixture of H

flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min

+ ethylene flowing at 4.0 ml (NTP) min

. The values of near-steady-state TOF were determined directly from the conversions of ethylene, which were <5.0% and shown to be differential
53
. After each catalyst reached steady-state operation, no substantial deactivation was observed at longer times on stream (176 h). Thereafter, the catalytic reaction experiments were carried out at various temperatures with the same feed gas to provide near-steady-state conversions at various temperatures. Each reported catalytic reaction rate (TOF) at each temperature is based on data from approximately 8 h of near-steady-state operation.

-Hexadecane hydrocracking
n
-Hexadecane hydrocracking was carried out in a stirred 50 ml Hastelloy slurry reactor at 260 °C for 6 h. In a typical test, the reactor was flushed with H
2
ten times to remove any residual air after the addition of 200 mg of catalyst (100 mg Pt/CeO
x
/SiO
2
-RED + 100 mg HY zeolite (Si:Al = 40, atomic)) and 2.00 g of
n
-hexadecane. HY zeolite was pretreated by calcination at 500 °C for 5 h. The reactor was pressurized with 3.0 MPa of H
2
at room temperature and heated and held at 260 °C for 6 h. The gas phase and products dissolved in
n
-hexadecane were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-2014).
Computational methods
Spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package code at the generalized gradient approximation level within the projector augmented wave/Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof formalism
54
,
55
. Hubbard
U
(
U
eff
= 5.0 eV) with effective on-site Coulomb interaction correction was used for the strongly correlated 4
f
electrons of cerium
56
. A CeO
2
(111) slab model (11.5 Å × 13.3 Å) with three triatomic layers was adopted to investigate the evolution of interfacial structures from that incorporating isolated single Pt
1
O
x
species to Pt
n
clusters. The total energy calculations were performed using a 2 × 2 × 1 grid and a plane-wave cut-off energy of 400 eV. A vacuum space greater than 15 Å was added in the
z
direction to avoid interaction with each slab. Atoms in the bottom triatomic layer of a catalyst model were fixed, and all the other atoms, including adsorbates, were allowed to relax until the force on each ion was less than 0.02 eV Å

(111), the nuclearity of the platinum clusters and the energy of an isolated single platinum atom, respectively. To check the stability of the candidate cluster structures under the experimental conditions, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed. The selected structures after the standard structure optimization calculations were used to run the AIMD simulations for a period of 3 ps at 400 °C by setting the canonical ensemble (
NVT
) with a Nose–Hoover thermostat. Then, the generated configurations were further optimized using standard DFT calculations to demonstrate the stability. The optimal adsorption configurations of the reactants (C

and H

) on the selective Pt

hydrogenation, the initial and final states were first optimized. The transition states were then searched using both the climbing image nudged elastic band method and the complete linear/quadratic synchronous transit method
