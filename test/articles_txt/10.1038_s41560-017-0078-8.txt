Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO
2
to chemical fuel offers a promising strategy for managing the global carbon balance, but presents challenges for chemistry due to the lack of effective electrocatalyst. Here we report atomically dispersed nickel on nitrogenated graphene as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for CO
2
reduction. Based on operando X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, the monovalent Ni(
i
) atomic center with a
d

electronic configuration was identified as the catalytically active site. The single-Ni-atom catalyst exhibits high intrinsic CO
2
reduction activity, reaching a specific current of 350 A g
catalyst

and turnover frequency of 14,800 h
−1
at a mild overpotential of 0.61 V for CO conversion with 97% Faradaic efficiency. The catalyst maintained 98% of its initial activity after 100 h of continuous reaction at CO formation current densities as high as 22 mA cm

Electrochemical conversion of CO

to chemical fuel, the reverse reaction of combustion, offers a promising strategy for management of the global carbon balance
1
,

,

. A desirable CO
2
reduction catalyst would have a low overpotential to drive catalysis and a large turnover frequency (TOF), and simultaneously be highly selective and stable. Unfortunately, current electrocatalytic CO
2
reduction processes are still very inefficient, because of the extremely stable chemical bond in CO
2
(C=O, 806 kJ mol
−1
) and the competing water reduction reaction in the aqueous phase
4
,
5
. By comparing the figures of merit of several CO
2
reduction catalysts
6
, it was concluded that the reduction of CO
2
to CO or formic acid (CO

2
reduction pathways. Cu, Ag, Au and their alloys are currently the most active electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO
2
to CO in aqueous solution
5
,
7
,
8
,
9
. Development of improved catalysts with adequate activity and selectivity is still a long-term goal in order to realize their practical application. Single-atom catalysts with atomically distributed active metal centres have demonstrated maximum atom efficiency and excellent selectivity in several catalytic reactions because of the unique electronic properties of a single active site
10
,
11
,
12
, and thus are expected to have great potential to improve the performance of the CO
2
reduction reaction
13
. However, the construction of stable single-atom catalysts remains a grand challenge due to the high surface energy of single atoms. More importantly, the electronic structure of single-atom catalysts has remained elusive, and this impedes understanding of these catalysts and the further design of new single-atom catalysts for the CO
2
reduction reaction

,

.
Here, we have developed a single-atom catalyst consisting of isolated, high-density, low-valent Ni(
i
) anchored on an N-doped graphene matrix as a robust and efficient electrocatalyst for CO
2
reduction. The single-Ni-atom catalyst exhibits high intrinsic CO
2
reduction activity and stability. CO
2
molecular activation and electrochemical reduction on low-valent Ni(
i
) were investigated by operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. Our results demonstrate the delocalization of the unpaired electron in the Ni
\(3{d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}}\)
orbital and spontaneous charge transfer from Ni(
i
) to the carbon 2
p
orbital in CO
2
to form a CO
2
δ
−
species. These processes help to reduce the energy barrier for electrochemical CO
2
reduction.
Structural characterization of single-Ni-atom catalyst
The single-Ni-atom catalyst was prepared by pyrolysing a mixture of amino acid (
l
-alanine or
l
-cysteine), melamine and nickel acetate in argon (Supplementary Fig.
2
). The as-prepared catalyst has a two-dimensional (2D) structure with smooth surfaces (Fig.
1a,b
); this was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (Fig.
1a
(inset) and Supplementary Fig.
3a,b
). Figure
1c
compares the XRD patterns of the single-Ni-atom catalysts prepared without and with addition of a sulfur precursor (
l
-cysteine) (denoted A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG, respectively). The metallic Ni diffraction peaks that were observed in N-doped graphene decorated with Ni nanoparticles (denoted Ni-NG, Supplementary Figs.
3c, d
), are absent in both patterns (Fig.
1c
), and only (002) and (004) carbon diffraction peaks at 26.2° and 44.0° are observed. The relatively weaker, broader peaks for A-Ni-NSG, compared with those for A-Ni-NG, indicate that the additional S doping results in a lower degree of crystallization and a defect-rich structure
16
. The specific surface area of A-Ni-NSG was around 406 m
2
g
−1
, which is much larger than those of A-Ni-NG (304 m
2
g
−1
) and Ni-NG (250 m
2
g
−1
) (Supplementary Fig.
3g
). All of the above results suggest that the Ni species are highly dispersed as tiny clusters or single atoms on the graphene sheets and these are undetectable by XRD, AFM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The dispersion of Ni atoms on the graphene was confirmed by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). As shown in Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
3h–j
, bright spots corresponding to single Ni atoms (sizes of the bright spots are ~0.2 nm) were homogeneously distributed across the entire carbon framework in both A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG.

The chemical composition and elemental states of A-Ni-NG, A-Ni-NSG and Ni-NG were investigated by XPS (Supplementary Fig.
3
, Supplementary Table
1
). The high-resolution XPS N 1
s
spectrum deconvoluted into pyridinic (
∼
398.2 eV), Ni–N (
∼
399.5 eV), pyrrolic (
∼
400.5 eV), quaternary (
∼
401.3 eV) and oxidized (
∼
403.0 eV) N species (inset of Fig.
1e
)
17
. Compared with Ni-NG, A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG have higher N contents (2.2 at% and 2.8 at% Ni–N species, respectively), and N is in the pyridinic form
17
,
18
. The high-resolution XPS S 2
p
spectrum of A-Ni-NSG displays a peak at 162 eV, which was assigned to the Ni–S bond
19
(Supplementary Fig.
4c
). The content of S bonded to Ni in A-Ni-NSG was around 0.07 at%. These results imply the formation of Ni–S–C in addition to Ni–N–C in A-Ni-NSG. The atomic concentrations of Ni in A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG determined by XPS were 0.82 at% (4 wt%) and 0.47 at% (2.5 wt%), respectively, which are close to those obtained by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (4.6 and 2.8 wt%, respectively). The binding energies of Ni 2
p
3/2
in A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG were 855.0 and 854.8 eV, respectively (Fig.
1f
), which are approximately 1.0 eV lower than that of Ni
2+
in nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) (856.0 eV). In Ni-NG, Ni 2
p
3/2
is dominated by the peak at 853.5 eV, which corresponds to metallic Ni
0
, and there is a minor peak at 855.8 eV, which is ascribed to Ni
2+
. Thus, the XPS results for Ni 2
p
suggest that the Ni atoms in A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG are likely to be in a low-valent state.
Electronic states of Ni atom in single-Ni-atom catalysts
The oxidation states of the Ni atoms were further determined from the position of the rising edge of the Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) (Fig.
2a
), which was determined by the inflection point of the second-derivative spectrum (Supplementary Fig.
5a
). From this, we concluded that the oxidation state of the Ni atoms in A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG was +1 with a 3
d
9
,
S
= 1/2 electronic configuration. This agrees with the L-edge XAS (Supplementary Fig.
5b
) and XPS results. The unpaired electron in Ni(
i
) was directly observed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (Fig.
2b
) and further verified by Bader charge analysis and the projected density of states (Supplementary Fig.
5f,g
). The
g
values of 2.215 and 2.285 at room temperature and 77 K, respectively, in the EPR spectra were assigned to the unpaired electron in the
\(3{d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}}\)
orbital of Ni(
i
)
20
,
21
. Monovalent Ni(
i
) atoms have been considered as the catalytically active sites in many important reactions
22
,
23
,
24
owing to the high reactivity of the partially occupied
\(3{d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}}\)
orbital. However, Ni(
i
) complexes are extremely thermally unstable and disproportionately form Ni(0) and Ni(
ii
) compounds
24
,
25
. The formation of Ni(
i
) atoms on A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG is attributed to the lower electronegativity of pyridinic N and S relative to the pyrrolic N in Ni(
ii
)Pc.

Full size image
The XAS spectra of A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG contain similar characteristic features (labelled A–D in Fig.
2a
) to those of Ni(
ii
)Pc. The differences lie mainly in the relative intensities and edge positions, and this indicates that A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG possess comparable
D
4
h
symmetry as Ni(
ii
)Pc (ref.
26
). The inset in Fig.
2a
highlights the pre-edge features of the XANES spectra; the peak at approximately 8,334 eV is assigned to the dipole-forbidden but quadrupole-allowed transition (1
s
→ 3
d
), which signals 3
d
and 4
p
orbital hybridization of the Ni central atoms
27
. The integrated pre-edge peak intensity of Ni(
ii
)Pc is very weak, which is expected from its high
D
4
h
centro-symmetry. The increases in the pre-edge peak intensity in A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG are ascribed to increased dipole-allowed transitions (1
s
→ 4
p
), which occur through mixing of the 3
d
and 4
p
orbitals as a result of the distorted
D
4
h
symmetry
27
. Compared with that observed for Ni(
ii
)Pc, the intensities of the 1
s
→ 4
p
z
transition (peak B) in A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG are reduced. These transitions act as a fingerprint for square-planar M–N
4
moieties
19
,
28
, and this result thus further confirms the distorted
D
4
h
symmetry of the Ni atom in A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG. Additionally, A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG show considerably larger relative intensity ratios for peaks C and D (
I
C
/
I
D
) than Ni(
ii
)Pc. These two peaks are attributed to the 1
s

p
x
,
y
transitions and multiple scattering processes, respectively
15
,
29
. Increased
I
C
/
I
D
has been found to correlate well with enhanced oxygen reduction reaction activity
15
. A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG are therefore expected to have good electrocatalytic activities. Figure
2c
displays the Fourier transform of the phase-uncorrected extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra. Peaks at 2.15 Å, which correspond to Ni–Ni interaction and appear in Ni-NG and Ni foil (Supplementary Fig.
5c
), were not observed in A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG. This confirms the HAADF-STEM results and suggests the presence of isolated Ni atoms on the nitrogenated graphene. The main peak at approximately 1.45 Å is attributed to the scattering interaction between the Ni atoms and the first shell (Ni–N). An additional small peak appears at 1.81 Å for A-Ni-NSG; this is approximately 0.36 Å larger than the Ni–N distance, and is consistent with the longer Ni–S bond length
30
. Figure
2d
show that the Fourier transformations of the EXAFS spectra of A-Ni-NG fit well with the structure shown in the inset of Fig.
2d
(optimized by DFT), which confirms the Ni–N
4
structure of A-Ni-NG (Supplementary Fig.
5d,e
for A-Ni-NSG). Supplementary Table
2
summarizes the fitting results of the EXAFS spectra of A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG.
Electrochemical CO
2
reduction
Inspired by the unique structural features of A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG, we evaluated their activity in the electrochemical reduction of CO
2
on a rotating disc electrode by cyclic voltammetry (CV; Supplementary Figs.
6a–d
) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV; Fig.
3a
). A cathodic peak at approximately −0.7 V (versus RHE) was observed in the CV curve, and the peak current was linearly dependent on the square root of the scan rate (Supplementary Fig.
6e
), which suggests that this peak originates from CO
2
mass transfer controlled processes
31
. The liquid and gaseous products were analysed by on-line gas chromatography and off-line high-performance liquid chromatography in an H-type electrochemical cell separated by a Nafion 117 membrane. Supplementary Fig.
6k
shows typical current profiles for the catalyst biased at different potentials in CO
2
-saturated 0.5-M KHCO
3
solution for analysis of the reduction products and Faradaic efficiency. CO, H
2
and CH
4
were detected in the gas phase, but no liquid products were detected in the potential range from 0 to −1.325 V (versus RHE) (Supplementary Fig.
7a,b
). Pristine N-doped graphene (NG) showed negligible CO
2
reduction activity (Fig.
3a
). Decoration of NG with metallic Ni nanoparticles (mean size: ~15 nm, Supplementary Fig.
3c,d
) resulted in improved activity and selectivity of Ni-NG towards CO
2
reduction. Further reducing the size of the Ni particles to single atoms in A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG provided catalysts with improved performance in CO
2
to CO reduction. In the mass-transport-limited region, for example, at an applied potential of −1.0 V (versus RHE), the A-Ni-NSG electrode produced a large cathodic current density of 115 mA cm
−2
; this corresponds to a mass activity of 1,150 A g
catalyst
−1
. The inset of Fig.
3a
highlights the LSV curves of various catalysts at a potential range from −0.1 to −0.7 V (versus RHE). These curves show that the CO
2
reduction onset potential of A-Ni-NSG is at least 100 mV lower than that of A-Ni-NG. As discussed earlier regarding the XANES spectra and Supplementary Table
2
, the geometry around Ni(
i
) in A-Ni-NSG is highly distorted owing to the non-centrosymmetric ligand strength, and this is expected to promote better adsorption of reactants and intermediates on the catalyst surface
15
, which was further verified by DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig.
8a,b
and Supplementary Tables
3
,
4
). Figure
3b
compares the Faradaic efficiency of CO formation for a number of catalysts; among these, A-Ni-NSG exhibits the lowest onset overpotential towards CO formation (
∼
70 mV, Supplementary Fig.
7c
), which is consistent with the overpotential determined from the LSV curves. Furthermore, the A-Ni-NSG electrode exhibits a maximum Faradaic efficiency (CO) of about 97% at around −0.5 V (versus RHE). Further reduction of CO to methane is completely suppressed (Supplementary Fig.
7b
) because of the weak binding of CO to the single Ni atom site. Notably, the two single-Ni-atom catalysts maintain greater than 80% selectivity towards CO formation, even at very negative applied potentials, and this selectivity is almost independent of the proton concentration (Supplementary Fig.
7d
). CO as the electrochemical CO
2
reduction product was confirmed by mass spectrometry using
13
CO
2
as the feedstock for the reaction (Supplementary Fig.
6i
). Tafel slopes of 108 and 114 mV decade
−1
were obtained for A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
7e
). This suggests that the first electron transfer, which generates surface adsorbed *COOH species, is the rate-determining step for CO evolution
32
. The exchange current density of A-Ni-NSG is approximately 10
−3
mA per cm
geometry
2
, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than that of Ag nanoparticles
33
and implies a considerably higher intrinsic rate of electron transfer and faster catalytic kinetics for A-Ni-NSG.

The calculated TOF of A-Ni-NSG reaches 14,800 h
−1
at an overpotential of 0.61 V; this is at least one order of magnitude larger than those of cobalt protoporphyrin and noble metal catalysts in aqueous solution (Fig.
3c
), which previously exhibited the highest TOFs of all reported CO
2
to CO reduction catalysts (Supplementary Table
5
). More importantly, the CO
2
to CO reduction performance of A-Ni-NSG is extremely stable, retaining 98% of the initial current for CO formation (
∼
22 mA cm
−2
) after 100 hours of continuous operation (Fig.
3d
). HAADF-STEM image and high-resolution XPS Ni 2

spectra (Supplementary Figs.

), measured before and after 100 hours of electrochemical CO

reduction, show identical Ni 2

bonding energies (

Molecular activation and reduction of CO
2
To clarify the details of the adsorption and activation of CO
2
on A-Ni-NG, Ni K-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra were performed under operando conditions. Figure
4a,b
displays the normalized operando Ni K-edge XANES spectra and the corresponding Fourier transforms of the EXAFS spectra. As shown in the inset of Fig.
4a
, there was a shift of the Ni K-edge to approximately 0.4 eV higher energy in CO
2
-saturated KHCO
3
solution under open-circuit voltage bias compared with that in Ar-saturated KHCO
3
solution. This indicates an increase in the Ni oxidation state, which probably results from delocalization of the unpaired electron in the
\(3{d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}}\)
orbital and spontaneous charge transfer from Ni(
i
) to the carbon 2
p
orbital in CO
2
to form a CO
2
δ
−
species
34
,
35
. During electrochemical CO
2
reduction, the Ni K-edge of A-Ni-NG shifted back to lower energy, which indicates the recovery of low-oxidation-state Ni after one cycle of CO
2
reduction (Ni(

O). The intensity of the main peak at approximately 1.45 Å in the Fourier transform of the EXAFS spectrum (Fig.
4b
) increased slightly; this was ascribed to a contribution from the Ni–C bond
36
that overlapped with the Ni–N bond. The main peak shifted (
∼
0.04 Å) to longer lengths during CO
2
reduction with the catalyst biased at −0.7 V versus RHE, compared with that under open-circuit voltage bias, which suggests expansion of the Ni–N bond. This is due to distortion of the Ni atoms out of the graphene plane, and results from redistribution of the electrons in the Ni 3
d
orbital between the four N ligands and the Ni–C bond (from adsorbed CO
2
).

activation were further investigated by photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. Supplementary Fig.
9a–c
shows the change in the chemical states of A-Ni-NG before and after CO
2
adsorption. The differential XPS spectra of O 1
s
induced by CO
2
adsorption (Fig.
4c
) can be deconvoluted into two O species, the chemically adsorbed CO
2
δ
–
species (531.1 eV) and physically adsorbed CO
2
(533.5 eV)
37
. An increase in the work function of A-Ni-NG was determined from the shift in the second electron cutoff edge (~0.7 eV) to lower binding energy after exposure of the A-Ni-NG catalyst to CO
2
gas (Supplementary Fig.
9e
). This result confirms the charge transfer from the A-Ni-NG catalyst to the CO
2
molecule and the formation of the CO
2
δ
–
species on the surface of A-Ni-NG
37
,
38
. The change in the valence band of the A-Ni-NG catalyst caused by the formation of the CO
2
δ
–
species on the surface (Fig.
4d
) dramatically reduces the Ni 3
d
density of states and the down-shift of the valence band edge (Supplementary Fig.
9f
), and indicates charge transfer from the
\(3{d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}}\)
orbital of Ni(
i
) to the C 2
π
u
orbital. DFT calculations indicate that the increase in the density of states around 3–6 eV below the Fermi level results from the 1
π
orbital of the bent CO
2
molecules adsorbed on Ni(
i
) and the delocalization of the Ni 3
d
orbital (Supplementary Fig.
9g
). On the basis of the above analyses, we propose the activation processes for CO
2
molecules on the Ni(
i
) active site and the structural evolution of the active site in the electrochemical CO
2
reduction (Fig.
4e
).
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated atomically dispersed, low-valent Ni(
i
) centres with high intrinsic CO
2
reduction activity. The discovery of a single-atom low-valent Ni(
i
) heterogeneous catalyst not only demonstrates single-atom heterogeneous catalysis in electrochemical CO
2
reduction, but also offers a unique insight into the active site geometry and structural transitions during CO
2
reduction, which will be essential for the development of future CO
2
catalysts.

Synthesis of atomically nickel-dispersed graphene catalysts
In a typical synthesis of atomically nickel-dispersed nitrogenated graphene catalyst (A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG), a mixture of melamine (C

O) (0.2 g) was first ground into a homogeneous precursor using zirconia ball in a nylon jar. Subsequently, the fine powder mixture underwent a two-stage pyrolysis and carbonization process (first stage: from 25 to 600 °C at a ramping rate of 3 °C min
–1
, maintain at 600 °C for 2 h; second stage: from 600 to 900 °C at a ramping rate of 2 °C min
–1
, maintain at 900 °C for 1 h) in a tubular furnace (Carbolite, UK) in argon atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was successively leached at 80 °C in 1 M HCl for 12 h and 1 M HNO
3
for another 24 h to remove metal particles and unstable species. Afterwards, the sample was heated again at 850 °C in Ar for 1 h to recover the crystallinity of carbon.
Nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) was prepared by pyrolyzing a mixture of graphene oxide (100 mg) and melamine (500 mg) at 1,000 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace under argon atmosphere. To prepare metallic Ni-nanoparticle-decorated nitrogen-doped graphene (Ni-NG), 100 mg of graphene oxide was first dispersed in 30 ml of deionized (DI) water by ultrasonication, followed by addition of 2.5 mg of nickel(
ii
) acetate tetrahydrate. The mixture was kept stirred over a water bath at 80 °C for 2 h, then freeze dried for 24 h to remove DI water. Subsequently, the dried product was ground with 500 mg of melamine into a homogeneous mixture, followed by a pyrolysis process at 900 °C for 2 h in argon atmosphere. The Ni-NG was obtained by cooling to room temperature.
Characterization
The crystal structure and morphology of the catalysts were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (
λ
= 1.5406 Å), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6700F), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). The thickness of the samples was measured by atomic force microscopy (Nanoman, Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) using the tapping mode. Detailed chemical compositions were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray beam (1,486.6 eV). All binding energies were referenced to the C 1
s
peak (284.6 eV). Specific surface area was measured based on a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using Autosorb 6B at liquid-nitrogen temperature. Sub-ångström-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) characterization was conducted on a JEOL JEMARM200F STEM/TEM with a guaranteed resolution of 0.08 nm. X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were acquired on a Bruker Elexsys 580 spectrometer at room temperature and 77 K. Microwave frequency was set at 9.86 GHz (X-band) with a power of 20 mW in an SHQE resonator.
Computational framework
The calculations of geometry optimization and electronic structure were carried out by density functional theory as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with consideration of spin-polarization
39
, using projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential for the core electrons
40
, a 480 eV cutoff energy for the valence electrons, and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) for the exchange-correlation potentials
41
.
The single Ni atom dispersed graphene catalyst was simulated using a (6 × 6) graphene sheet (14.816 Å × 14.816 Å) with Ni bonding to four N atoms in double vacancy of graphene (A-Ni-NG). For the S-doped catalyst, we considered the configuration of one N atom of NiN
4
-graphene replaced by an S atom (A-Ni-NSG). The optimized configurations are shown in Supplementary Fig.
5f
. A vacuum space of ~11 Å along the
Z
direction was used to separate the interaction between the neighbouring slabs. The 6 × 6 × 1 gamma-centered
k
-mesh was chosen to sample the surface Brillouin-zone. The cluster model of Ni(
ii
)Pc was placed in a cubic box of 30 Å × 30 Å × 30 Å and performing gamma point calculations. For the calculation of density of states (DOS), the
k
-mesh was increased to 12 × 12 × 1. The adsorption configurations are fully relaxed until the force on each atom is smaller than 0.01 eV Å
–1
.
The adsorption energy of reaction intermediates is defined as:
$${E}_{{\rm{ads}}}={E}_{{\rm{Sub}}/{\rm{M}}}-{E}_{{\rm{Sub}}}-{E}_{{\rm{M}}}$$
where
E
Sub/M
,
E
Sub
and
E
M
denote the total energies of an adsorbed system, a clean substrate, and an adsorbate at free state, respectively, each of which can be obtained directly from DFT calculations. The adsorption energies are converted into Gibbs free energies through
$$\Delta G={E}_{{\rm{ads}}}+\Delta {\rm{ZPE}}-T\Delta S+\Delta {G}_{{\rm{u}}}$$
where ΔZPE,
T
Δ
S
, and Δ
G
u
represent the change of zero point energy, change of entropy (
T
= 298.15 K), and the contribution of the electrode potential to Δ
G
, respectively. The zero point energy is calculated within the harmonic approximation using the finite difference method with displacements of ±0.015 Å. The entropy of the chemisorbed intermediates only takes the vibrational entropy into account. The entropy of the free gas is taken from the standard thermodynamic database
42
. For the reaction steps containing pairs of proton and electron transfer, the relative free energies are calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode (SHE) model
43
, where the chemical potential of a pair of proton and electron (H
+
+ e
−
) is assumed to half that of H
2
gas, and Δ
G
is changed by −
n
e
U
, where
n
e
is the number of electrons and
U
is the applied electrode potential. The details of the calculation for Δ
G
are listed in Supplementary Tables

.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were carried out at ambient temperature and pressure on a rotating electrode system (Pine) with a CHI 660e potentiostat. A three-electrode cell configuration was employed with a working electrode of glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) of 5 mm diameter, a counter electrode of platinum foil (1 × 2 cm
2
), and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE). To prepare the catalyst ink, 5 mg of catalyst and 25 μl of 5% Nafion 117 solution, as conducting binder, were introduced into 975 μl of water–isopropanol solution with equal volumes of water and isopropanol and sonicated for 3 h. An aliquot of 4 μl of the catalyst ink was applied onto a glassy carbon RDE and allowed to dry in air, giving a catalyst loading of 0.1 mg cm
−2
. A CO
2
-saturated electrolyte was prepared by purging CO
2
(99.99%) into 0.5 M KHCO
3
aqueous solution for 30 min, and a flow of CO
2
was maintained over the electrolyte throughout the electrochemical measurements. For comparison, CV measurements were also performed in an Ar (99.99%)-saturated electrolyte. All potentials were calculated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation (
E
RHE
=
E
SCE
+ 0.0591 × pH + 0.241 V, at 25 °C). The linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were collected at a scan rate of 5 mV s
−1
. The Tafel slope was calculated based on the Tafel equation (
ƞ
=
b
log
(j
CO
/
j
o
)
), where
ƞ
is the overpotential,
b
is the Tafel slope,
j
CO
is the current density for CO formation, and
j
o
is the exchange current density. All LSV data were corrected for an ohmic drop (~22 Ω in CO
2
-saturated 0.5 M KHCO
3
). All current densities were normalized to the geometrical area of electrode. Roughness factor (RF) was calculated as the ratio of the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) on the electrode to the geometric area of the disk electrode. Based on the definition: ECSA =
C
dl
/
C
s
(double layer capacitance/specific capacitance),
C
dl
corresponds to the slope of the double-layer charging current versus the scan rate (
ν
) plot, we used a specific capacitance (
C
s
) value of 20 μF cm
−2
.
H-type electrochemical cell for CO
2
reduction
The products and Faradic efficiency of CO
2
reduction were measured using chronoamperometry at each fixed potential in an H-type electrochemical cell separated by a Nafion 117 membrane (Supplementary Fig.
1a
). The area of the working electrode is fixed at 1 cm
2
. To prepare the working electrode, the catalyst ink (10 mg ml
−1
) was brush-painted directly onto a dry carbon fibre paper (CFP) (AvCarb P75T) at a temperature of 50 °C, giving a catalyst loading of 0.4 mg cm
−2
. The gaseous products (H
2
, CO and CH
4
) were quantified by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) for CO and CH
4
and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H
2
quantification. Ultra pure helium (He, 99.9999%) was used as the carrier gas. The average flow rate of CO
2
was controlled at 10 cc min
−1
at the inlet of electrochemical cell by a standard series mass flow controller (Alicat Scientific mc-50 sccm) and measured by a flow meter (Thermo Scientific GFM Pro) at the exit of the electrochemical cell. GC was calibrated using standard gas mixtures (Singapore Oxygen Air Liquide Pte) under standard conditions (1 atm, 298 K). Supplementary Fig.
1b–d
displays the GC calibration curves for H
2
, CO and CH
4
. To confirm the origin of the as-produced CO, the isotopic
13
CO

2
SO
4
aqueous solution with Ar as the carrying gas; the products were analysed by a gas analysis system (Hiden analytical, HPR-20 QIC).
Faradic efficiency calculation
Based on the definition of Faradic efficiency:
$${{\rm{FE}}}_{i}=\frac{{Q}_{i}}{{Q}_{{\rm{total}}}}$$
(1)
where
i
represents CO, H
2
or CH
4
.
Q
i
and
Q
total
can be obtained from the following equations:
$${Q}_{i}={Z}_{i}\times F\times {N}_{i}$$
(2)
$${Q}_{{\rm{total}}}=I\times t$$
(3)
Based on the GC data and ideal gas law:
$${N}_{i}={N}_{{\rm{total}}}\times {V}_{i}$$
(4)
$${N}_{{\rm{total}}}=\frac{{P}_{{\rm{o}}}\times {V}_{{\rm{o}}}}{R\times {T}_{{\rm{o}}}}$$
(5)
$${V}_{{\rm{o}}}=G\times t$$
(6)
where
G
is the volumetric flow rate.
So, equation (
1
) can be written as:
\({\rm{FE}}=\frac{{z}_{i}\times {v}_{i}\times G\times F\times {P}_{{\rm{o}}}}{I\times R\times {T}_{{\rm{o}}}\times 60,000}\)
where
N

N

V

: volume of the GC sampling loop;
t
: time for gas to fill the GC sampling loop;
I
: the average current in a period (

) of electrocatalysis:
\(I=\frac{{\int }_{0}^{t}I\left(t\right){\rm{d}}t}{t}\)
V

in the GC sampling loop;
Z

: number of electrons required to produce an
i
molecule, which is 2, 2 and 8 for CO, H
2
and CH
4
, respectively;
F
: Faradaic constant (96,485.33289 C mol
−1
);
P
0
: atmospheric pressure (1.013 × 10

).
Evaluation of turnover frequency
TOFs (h
–1
) for the CO
2
reduction reaction (RR) were evaluated based on the 2-electron pathway.
$$\begin{array}{cc}\\ {\rm{TOF}}= & \frac{{\rm{Turnover}}\,{\rm{number}}\,{\rm{for}}\,{\rm{CO}}\,{{\rm{formation}}}/{\rm{geometric}}\,{\rm{area}}}{{\rm{Number}}\,{\rm{of}}\,{\rm{active}}\,{{\rm{sites}}}/{\rm{geometric}}\,{\rm{area}}}\end{array}$$
Turnover number for CO formation:
$$\begin{array}{ll}{\rm{TON}}&=\frac{{\rm{Q}}\times {{\rm FE}_{\rm CO}}}{2F}= \frac{{J}\times t\times {{\rm FE}_{\rm CO}}\,}{2F}\\&=\left(\frac{35.5\times 10^{-3}\times 3600\times 0.965}{2\times 96485.3}\right) \times 6.02 \times 10^{23}\\&= 3.85 \times 10^{20}\,{\rm{cm}}^{-2}\mathrm{h}^{-1}\end{array}$$
where
Q
is the total charge,
J
and FE
CO
are current density and Faradic efficiency of CO formation at the overpotential of 0.61 V, respectively.
F=

(Faraday constant).
Catalyst loading on glassy carbon RDE is 0.1 mg cm

. The content of Ni in A–Ni–NSG is 2.5 wt%.
Number of active sites per cm

:
\(\begin{array}{ll}N&={\mathrm{Avogadro}\ \mathrm{constant}} \times \left(\frac{{\rm{Weight}}\,{\rm{of}}\,{\rm{nickel}}\,{\rm{on}}\,{\rm{electrode}}}{{\rm{Molecular}}\,{\rm{weight}}\,{\rm{of}}\,{\rm{nickel}}}\right)\\&=6.02 \times 10^{23} \times \left( \frac{(1\times 10^{-4})\times(2.5 \times 10^{-2})}{58}\right)=2.6\times 10^{16}{\rm{cm}}^{-2}\\\end{array}\)
Thus,
\({\rm{TOF}}=\frac{{\rm{TON}}}{{N}}=\frac{3.85{\times} 10^{20}}{2.6{\times} 10^{16}}={14807}\,{\rm{h}}^{-1}\)
where the current density for the CO
2
reduction reaction at an overpotential of 0.61 V deduced from the LSV curve is ~ 36 mA cm

with a FE
CO
of 96.5%.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and operando XAS measurements were collected by employing synchrotron radiation light source at BL12B2 beam line of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in SPring 8 (Japan) at room temperature. Energy calibration was performed with a nickel foil standard by shifting all spectra to a glitch in the incident intensity. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a seven-element Ge solid state detector. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were fitted using the FEFF 6.0 code and the structure parameters of A-Ni-NG and A-Ni-NSG were obtained from the DFT calculation.
A home-made cell was designed for the operando experiments, which were operated under identical conditions as the electrochemical measurements. For the operando measurements, the cell was filled with electrolyte (0.5 M aqueous KHCO
3
). SCE and Pt were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. The catalyst was hand-brushed on a carbon-fibre electrode (1 mg cm
−2
), followed by pressing the electrode between the electrolyte compartment of the cell and Kapton (polyimide) tape to seal the cell. Operando X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra were recorded at three conditions: (1) under open-circuit potential in Ar saturated electrolyte; (2) under open-circuit potential in CO
2
saturated electrolyte; and (3) at applied potential of −0.7 V versus RHE in CO
2
saturated electrolyte. At each stage, the catalyst-loaded electrode was maintained under these conditions for 30 min before collecting the spectrum.
Ni L-edge X-ray absorption spectra were measured in the total X-ray electron yield mode at room temperature using BL-20A beam line at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC, Hsinchu, Taiwan) in which the electron storage ring was operated at 1.5 GeV with a beam current of 300 mA. For Ni L-edge absorption, the data were collected at the 6 m high-energy spherical grating monochromator beamline with 10 × 10 µm opening slits, corresponding to
∼
0.08 eV energy resolution. Simultaneously, the signal from a gold grid located upstream in the X-ray path was recorded, and the spectra were normalized using the incident beam intensity,
I
0
, keeping the area under the spectra fixed over an energy range of 840–880 eV for the Ni L-edge.
Real-time X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy investigations
Real-time XPS experiments were carried out in a lab-based Specs Phoibos 150 near ambient pressure (NAP) system with a conventional Al/Mg twin X-ray source and helium-I source. The pass energy was set at 20 eV, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) for C 1
s
was ~1.5 eV. All binding energies were referenced to the C 1
s
peak (284.6 eV). The UPS measurements were carried out in the same NAP-XPS system. A 300 μm nozzle was used and the sample was illuminated directly by the helium-I source (
hν
= 21.2 eV) using a VUV lamp (VG Microtech 232). The sample was earthed (no bias voltage) with an emission angle of ~40 °. The pass energy of the analyzer was set at 2 eV. The A-Ni-NG catalyst was dispersed in deionized water, and then drop-casted on a graphite sheet. UPS and XPS spectra were first collected from clean A-Ni-NG catalyst, which was thermally treated at 500 °C for 20 min in vacuum. Subsequently, the catalyst was exposed to high purity CO
2
gas (99.999%, CryoExpress Singapore) in the preparation chamber under 1 atm for 20 min.
