Abstract
Despite the growing demand for hydrogen peroxide it is almost exclusively manufactured by the energy-intensive anthraquinone process. Alternatively, H
2
O
2
can be produced electrochemically via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction, although the performance of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts is insufficient to meet the demands for industrialization. Interestingly, guided by first-principles calculations, we found that the catalytic properties of the Co–N
4
moiety can be tailored by fine-tuning its surrounding atomic configuration to resemble the structure-dependent catalytic properties of metalloenzymes. Using this principle, we designed and synthesized a single-atom electrocatalyst that comprises an optimized Co–N
4
moiety incorporated in nitrogen-doped graphene for H
2
O
2
production and exhibits a kinetic current density of 2.8 mA cm
−2
(at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) and a mass activity of 155 A g
−1
(at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) with negligible activity loss over 110 hours.

Main
Hydrogen peroxide (H
2
O
2
) is one of the most important chemicals as it plays a crucial role in the chemical and medical industries
1
,
2
. The industrial production of H
2
O
2
is heavily dependent on the anthraquinone process, which is an energy-intensive process that involves the hydrogenation of 2-alkylanthraquinone using expensive palladium catalysts
3
,
4
. Therefore, an electrochemical route to H
2
O
2
production under ambient conditions is highly desirable. The electrochemical production of H
2
O
2
by noble metal-based electrocatalysts (for example, Au–Pd, Pt–Hg, Pd–Hg and so on) has been shown to be effective
5
,
6
,
7
. The surface electronic structure of noble metals can be controlled by preparing their alloys, which has been used to optimize the adsorption energies of the reaction intermediates for a selective H
2
O
2
production. However, the H
2
O
2
productivity is still too low to meet the requirements for practical applications.
It is interesting to find that nature catalyses the dismutation of the superoxide (O
2
−
) radical into H
2
O
2
via an enzyme called superoxide dismutase to prevent oxidative cell damage. Superoxide dismutases are redox-active metalloenzymes composed of Earth-abundant metal cofactors and surrounding organic ligands
8
,
9
. Similar to superoxide dismutases, various molecular complexes that contain Earth-abundant metals (for example, cobalt) have been explored for H
2
O
2
production. It has been shown that H
2
O
2
productivity can be modulated by changing the surrounding atomic structure of the metal centre
10
,
11
. This suggests that a highly active non-noble metal catalyst can be developed if we can fine-tune the interaction between the metal centre and its local coordination environments.
Heterogeneous single-atom catalysts (SACs), which comprise single metal atoms stabilized on a support, provide a representative platform for studying the cooperative interactions between metal centres and the surrounding atomic configurations
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
. We are particularly interested in M–N
4
(M, transition metal) SACs supported on graphene for two reasons. First, they can be regarded as metal centres surrounded by porphyrin-like ligands, similar to metalloenzyme systems, and second, M–N
4
SACs are highly active for a variety of electrochemical reactions
17
,
18
,
19
,
20
,
21
,
22
. Although M–N
4
SACs have proved to be highly active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (mostly for four-electron ORR to generate water), the general principle that governs their selectivity specifically towards H
2
O
2
has not been elucidated
23
,
24
.
In this work, we focus on the electrochemical production of H
2
O
2
. We demonstrate the relationship between the nature of the M–N
4
/graphene moiety and the ORR selectivity using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical analysis. Consequently, we designed and synthesized the optimal Co–N
4
moiety incorporated in nitrogen-doped graphene (NG), denoted as Co
1
–NG(O), for electrochemical H
2
O
2
production that shows a kinetic current density of 2.8 ± 0.2 mA cm
−2
(at 0.65 V), a mass activity of 155 ± 6 A g
−1
(at 0.65 V) and negligible activity loss over 110 hours. Furthermore, the Co
1
–NG(O) electrocatalyst exhibits a high H
2
O
2
productivity of 418 ± 19 mmol g
cat
−1
h
−1
(at 50 mA) with a catalyst loading of ~1 mg cm

.
We performed periodic DFT calculations to identify the reaction energetics of H
2
O
2
production competing with H
2
O production on various M–N
4
/graphene catalysts (Supplementary Fig.
1
). Figure
1a
shows the volcano plot for ORR activity as a function of the OOH* adsorption energy (∆
G
OOH*
) (refs.
1
,
5
,
25
). We found that H
2
O
2
production is energetically preferred to H
2
O production for nickel, silver and platinum, whereas it is the other way around for ruthenium, iron and cobalt. As the former metal centres are not as oxophilic as the latter ones, they are more prone to OOH* protonation to give H
2
O
2
, whereas the latter metal centres prefer the breaking of the OOH* intermediates to O*, which leads to H
2
O formation.

According to the calculation results, none of the considered M–N
4
/graphene catalysts are near the peak of the volcano plot for H
2
O
2
production (∆
G
OOH*
= 4.2 eV). Even the catalysts that prefer H
2
O
2
production (nickel, silver and platinum) require relatively high overpotentials (>0.5 V) for H
2
O
2
production compared to, for example, the most active Co–N
4
/graphene that produces H
2
O (Supplementary Figs.
2
and
3
). It is desirable to slightly modify Co–N
4
/graphene such that it maintains most of its high catalytic activity, but towards H
2
O
2
production rather than H
2
O. Thus, fine-tuning of the interaction between the metal centre and the surrounding atomic configuration is required in addition to changing the metal centre of the Co–N
4
moiety to reach the optimum ∆
G
OOH*
value for highly active H
2
O
2
production. Regarding the by-product (H
2
O) of this process, the H
2
O
2
production rate is more important than the selectivity as most commercial applications require aqueous solutions of H
2
O
2
.
Interestingly, Fig.
1b
shows that we can adjust ∆
G
OOH*
by attaching functional groups near the Co–N
4
moiety. For example, when an electron-rich species, such as O*, is adsorbed near the Co–N
4
moiety (Co–N
4
(O)), ∆
G
OOH*
increases from 3.9 to 4.1 eV, getting very close to the optimal value for the H
2
O
2
production. ∆
G
OOH*
can be further increased to 4.5 eV when two O* are adsorbed near the Co–N
4
moiety (Co–N
4
(2O)). Similar conclusions can be drawn for the case in which another electron-rich species, OH*, is adsorbed near the Co–N
4
moiety (Supplementary Fig.
4
). However, when electron-poor species, such as H
+
, are adsorbed near the Co–N
4
moiety, ∆
G
OOH*
decreases from 3.9 to 3.8 eV on Co–N
4
(2H) and further to 3.1 eV on Co–N
4
(4H). Similar trends are observed when another electron-poor element, carbon, is introduced (Supplementary Fig.
4
).
These effects of the functional groups on ∆
G
OOH*
can be explained by the differences in the charge state of the cobalt atom. In the cases of Co–N
4
(O) and Co–N
4
(2O), the charge state of the cobalt atom becomes more positive by 0.05 e
−
and 0.10 e
−
, respectively, in qualitative agreement with the previous report
23
, whereas in the cases of Co–N
4
(2H) and Co–N
4
(4H), it becomes more negative by 0.21 e
−
and 0.35 e
−
, respectively (Fig.
1b,c
). Consequently, a rational design strategy of a SAC for H
2
O
2
production is to slightly increase the ∆
G
OOH*
of Co–N
4
/graphene by creating electron-rich oxygen species near the Co–N
4
moiety, such that they can slightly increase the charge state of the cobalt atom.
Therefore, we pay close attention to the oxygen-containing functional groups on graphene oxide (GO). The temperature-dependent evolution of functional groups on GO has been extensively studied
26
,
27
,
28
. It was shown that epoxides are thermally more stable than other functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups that desorb at lower temperatures
26
. A simple method to simultaneously dope nitrogen and reduce GO was developed, in which the oxygen functional groups are responsible for the reaction with NH
3
(ref.
27
). Therefore, the thermal annealing step is critical for designing Co–N
4
/graphene surrounded by the desired configuration of electron-rich oxygen atoms.
The overall synthetic scheme to prepare Co
1
–NG(O) SAC is illustrated in Fig.
2a
. Metal atoms are first adsorbed on the surface of GO by an impregnation method. The metal-adsorbed GO is then mildly reduced at 500 °C in NH
3
/Ar (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Figs.
5
–
7
). We chose the reduction temperature of 500 °C to preserve a high percentage of oxygen (6.6 at%) (Fig.
2b,c
). Despite the low annealing temperature, a relatively high percentage of nitrogen was incorporated (5.87 at%; Supplementary Fig.
8b
).

During the thermal reduction step, many vacancies form and provide anchoring sites for nitrogen atoms and preferential binding sites for metal atoms
29
. The atomic structure of Co
1
–NG(O) was imaged by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). Scanning transmission electron microscopy images show that individual cobalt atoms are uniformly dispersed throughout the entire graphene matrix (Fig.
2e,f
). Optimized Co
1
–NG(O) SACs have a high concentration of single metal atoms (1.4 wt%; Supplementary Table
1
). Other M
1
–NG(O) (M, iron or nickel) can be successfully prepared (Supplementary Figs.
9
–
12
) and they have a similar active surface area as confirmed by electrochemical surface area measurements (Supplementary Figs.
13
and
14
).
The atomic structure of Co
1
–NG(O) was further analysed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Fig.
2g
and Supplementary Fig.
15
). The Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) curves for Co
1
–NG(O) only showed a main peak (1.4 Å), which can be attributed to Co–N coordination, whereas the Co–Co peak (2.2 Å) was not detected. This is in agreement with the X-ray diffraction result that shows no metal peak (Supplementary Fig.
16
). We performed EXAFS fitting to analyse the structural parameters of cobalt atoms (Fig.
2g
). The fitted parameters are listed in Supplementary Table
2
and the coordination number is approximately 4. Similarly, the FT-EXAFS curves of other M
1
–NG(O) SACs were also fitted (Supplementary Figs.
17
and
18
) and their coordination numbers are also close to 4, which demonstrates the presence of metal atoms coordinated by four surrounding nitrogen atoms.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed that nitrogen was readily incorporated into the graphene matrix at 500 °C and the pyridinic nitrogen was dominant for Co
1
–NG(O) (Supplementary Fig.
8b
). Co
1
–NG(R) was also prepared by ammonia treatment at 900 °C, which is a typical carbonization temperature and is much higher than that for the preparation of Co
1
–NG(O) (500 °C) (Supplementary Figs.
5
–
7
and
15
). In comparison to Co
1
–NG(R), the Co 2
p
spectrum of Co
1
–NG(O) shows an upshift to a higher binding energy and the spin–orbit splitting (15.875 eV) of Co
1
–NG(O) is larger than that of Co
1
–NG(R) (15.504 eV), which indicates the lower charge density state of the cobalt atoms (Supplementary Fig.
19
)
30
. Thus, the Co
1
–NG(O) has highly oxidized cobalt atom centres, but the Co
1
–NG(R) is composed of relatively electron-rich cobalt single atoms.
The oxygen contents of pristine GO, Co
1
–NG(O) and Co
1
–NG(R) are 27.9, 6.6 and 2.1 at%, respectively. Specifically, the content of C–O–C oxygen species is 3.22 and 0.72 at% for Co
1
–NG(O) and Co
1
–NG(R), respectively (Fig.
2b,c
). Furthermore, in comparison to Co
1
–NG(R), the O K-edge near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra suggest that the Co
1
–NG(O) SAC has more intense and sharper peaks at 535 and 540.4 eV, which can be assigned as the transitions of the O 1
s
core level to antibonding
π
* states and
σ
* states from C–O bonds (for example, in C–O–C epoxides) (Supplementary Fig.
20
). This result was further confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Fig.
2h
and
Methods
). From the comprehensive analysis with XPS, NEXAFS and FTIR, we can conclude that cobalt centres become relatively electron poor when near to C–O–C atomic structures and that these groups are thermodynamically stable at the mild reduction temperature of 500 °C, which is further supported by the DFT analysis (Supplementary Fig.
21
). After reduction at 900 °C, most of the oxygen species, which including C–O–C groups, desorb (Fig.
2b
)
26
,
27
. Utilizing the thermodynamics of different functional groups on GO, we could design the Co–N
4
moieties surrounded by oxygen species (C–O–C epoxides), which is an ideal system for highly active H
2
O
2
production, as predicted by the DFT calculations (Fig.
1a
).
ORR kinetics can proceed via either a 2e
−
or a 4e
−
pathway (Fig.
3a
) and the selectivity is determined by the propensity to break the O–O bond during the ORR process. We can quantify the amount of H
2
O
2
formed using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) at 1,600 r.p.m. in an oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The ring electrode was held at 1.2 V to oxidize only the H
2
O
2
formed at disk electrode, which avoids other ORR currents at the ring electrode. The optimal catalyst loading amount was 10 μg cm
−2
(Supplementary Fig.
22
gives details). The Co
1
–NG(O) catalyst, which has an electron-poor cobalt centre induced by the surrounding oxygen species (for example, C–O–C epoxides), is able to catalyse the 2e
−
ORR and shows a superior activity for H
2
O
2
production in comparison to state-of-the-art catalysts (Figs.
3b
and
4a
). The electronic structure of the Co–N
4
site is modified by nearby C–O–C epoxides such that it is difficult to break the O–O bond, which ensures a high selectivity to H
2
O
2
(~82%; Fig.
3c
). However, Co
1
–NG(R), which is mainly composed of Co–N
4
sites, predominantly produce water, which matches well with our DFT results (Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.
23
). Figure
3d
shows the ring current adjusted by collection efficiency (Supplementary Fig.
24
) for H
2
O
2
production
\(\left( {I_{{\mathrm{H}}_2{\mathrm{O}}_2}} \right)\)
at 0.7 V. Notably, the Co
1
–NG(O) catalyst delivered a much higher H
2
O
2
production current than Co
1
–NG(R) or NG(O), which shows its superior activity and selectivity towards H
2
O
2
production. Co
1
–NG(O) shows an improvement in the onset potential and ORR kinetics with increasing cobalt amount, whereas Co
1
-G(O), which is composed of cobalt metal centres without nitrogen atom bonding, shows hardly any change (Supplementary Fig.
25
). This observation supports that the ORR performance is specifically associated with the Co–N
4
moieties and the optimal cobalt amount for H
2
O
2
production was 1.4 wt% (Supplementary Figs.
25
and
26
). A poisoning experiment using CN
−
further supports that Co–N
4
sites are the active sites, not the carbon surface (Supplementary Fig.
27
).

Interestingly, our Co
1
–NG(O) shows a significant amount of H
2
O
2
production in acidic (0.1 M HClO
4
), neutral (0.1 M phosphate) and basic (0.1 M KOH) electrolytes (Fig.
3b,e,f
). Without cobalt atoms, the NG(O) showed a poor activity, especially in an acidic medium, which is often seen in carbonaceous catalysts
31
,
32
(
Supplementary Information
gives details). However, our electron-poor cobalt metal centres serve as O
2
adsorption sites on the graphitic carbon matrix, which facilitates the adsorption of O
2
molecules and effectively prevents the 2e
−
+ 2e
−
reaction mechanism (Supplementary Fig.
28
). In addition, Co
1
–NG(O) exhibited a significantly higher activity for H
2
O
2
production than NG(O), Fe
1
–NG(O) and Ni
1
–NG(O) (Supplementary Fig.
29
), with an onset potential of ~0.8 V (Fig.
3b
). It is slightly higher than the thermodynamic limit of 0.76 V (in 0.1 M KOH, pH = 13), which has been also observed in the previously reported electrocatalysts based on noble metal alloys and carbon-based materials
5
,
32
,
33
. This can be attributed to a Nernst-related potential shift due to the low H
2
O
2
concentration in electrolyte under highly alkaline media (
Supplementary Information
gives details). These results indicate that Co
1
–NG(O) is highly active for H
2
O
2
production in a wide range of pH levels, but effectively prevents the consecutive reduction of H
2
O
2
into H
2
O.
For the comparison, the kinetic current density for H
2
O
2
production was derived by correcting for mass-transport limitations using the Koutecky–Levich equation (
Methods
). The calculated kinetic current density of Co
1
–NG(O) for H
2
O
2
production was 2.8 ± 0.2 mA cm
−2
(at 0.65 V), which demonstrates its superior H
2
O
2
production activity that far surpasses that of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts (Fig.
4a
)
5
,

,
34
,

production is summarized in Fig.

,

,

. Our optimized Co

-NG(O) produces H
2
O
2
with a mass activity of 155 (±6) A g
−1
(at 0.65 V, with 1,600 rpm) (Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Fig.
30
). Furthermore, we compared the mass activities of the recently reported carbonaceous catalysts with that of Co
1
–NG(O) in alkaline media at 0.75 V, much closer to the onset potential of the HO
2
−
/O
2
process, as the polarization of Co
1
–NG(O) can reach the mass-limiting current very quickly due to the electron-poor cobalt atoms that serve as O
2
adsorption sites. Until now, a few-layered, mildly reduced GO (F-mrGO) exhibited the highest mass activity. Notably, Co
1
–NG(O) exhibits a 3.5 times higher H
2
O
2
production activity (Fig.

) than that of F-mrGO. Furthermore, the turnover frequency value of Co
1
–NG(O) was calculated to be 3.38 ±0.15 s

(

gives details on the calculation), which is much higher than those of other catalysts (Supplementary Table

To evaluate the amount of H
2
O
2
generated in real devices, we prepared our catalyst on carbon paper (
Methods
) with a loading of 1 mg cm
−2
and tested it in a custom-made electrochemical H-type cell (Supplementary Fig.
31
) modified from that reported previously
32
,
33
. In an alkaline electrolyte, we performed the electrochemical H
2
O
2
production of Co
1
–NG(O) catalysts at 25 °C (Supplementary Fig.
32
gives details on the effect of reaction temperature). Co

–NG(O) showed a very high H

productivity of 418 ±19 mmol g
cat
−1
h
−1
(at 50 mA; Supplementary Table

and Supplementary Figs.
33
and
34
), which is more than twice the amount of H
2
O
2
produced by a Au–Pd catalyst in direct synthesis
40
, which demonstrates the feasibility of electrochemical H
2
O
2
production. Our optimized Co
1
–NG(O) catalyst could produce a H
2
O
2
concentration of 5,812 ppm (suitable for applications that require diluted H
2
O
2
solutions) after 24 hours using our custom-made H-type cell, which contains 10 ml of catholyte (Supplementary Fig.
35
). Furthermore, the Co
1
–NG(O) catalyst is stable throughout the entire pH level for a long-term production of H
2
O
2
, notably with a 98.7% activity retention over 110 hours at 0.65 V in alkaline conditions (Fig.
4d
). This confirms that the highly active Co–N
4
(O) moieties are very stable in either alkaline or acidic environments for the H
2
O
2
production (Supplementary Fig.
36
). Under the harsh condition of a higher overpotential (at 0.55 V), Co
1
–NG(O) still retains its excellent stability with little chemical and structural change (Supplementary Figs.
37
and
38
). When the reaction temperature is raised, the overall ORR kinetics and the H
2
O
2
selectivity increase, whereas the produced H
2
O
2
decomposes more rapidly (Supplementary Fig.
32
). Cobalt is commonly known to be less reactive to Fenton reactions when compared to iron-based catalysts, which suffer from poor stability. Recently, cobalt and manganese SACs were reported as good alternatives to iron-based electrocatalysts to prevent the serious degradation by Fenton reactions
23
,
41
. Thus, the high stability in a wide pH range and the substantially enhanced H
2
O
2
production activity can be simultaneously achieved by our design strategy of electron-poor cobalt metal centres modulated by the surrounding atomic configuration. Co
1
–NG(O) shows a H
2
O
2
production activity comparable to the previously reported platinum SACs in acidic media (
Supplementary Information
and Supplementary Fig.
39
give details).
Through experiments and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the surrounding atomic configuration of SACs mediates the H
2
O
2
production activity of metal centres. Owing to the diverse synthetic methods of Co–N
4
structures, there has been a debate on the reaction mechanism for ORR (a 2e
−
or 4e
−
pathway) regarding the Co–N
4
structure
24
,
41
. Thus, it is highly desirable to discover which physical factor regulates the catalytic activity and selectivity in atomic precision. Our strategy allows the fine-tuning of the heterogeneous catalytic activity for H
2
O
2
production over a wide pH range, which results in a kinetic current density of 2.8 ± 0.2 mA cm
−2
(at 0.65 V) and a mass activity of 155 ±6 A g
−1
(at 0.65 V) with negligible activity loss over 110 hours in basic condition. Our highly active and stable SAC that comprises non-precious metals is easily scalable (Supplementary Fig.
40
) and our concept can be generalized to other carbon materials (Supplementary Fig.
41
gives details), which opens up the possibilities for industrially viable electrochemical H
2
O
2
production. We believe our findings will provide further understanding of the fundamental relationship between the coordination environment of the atomic site and the catalytic performance for other catalytic reactions

GO was washed with hydrochloric acid solution and acetone to remove the metal impurities (for example, manganese) that are left during the Hummers method of producing GO (Supplementary Table

With the continuous feeding of ammonia (50 sccm) and argon (150 sccm) gas, the furnace was heated up to 500 °C (ramping rate = 5 °C min

ZIF-8 (Basolite Z1200 from Sigma-Aldrich) powder (1 g) was annealed at 900 °C for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere (yield ~0.32 g) in a tube furnace to obtain ZIF-derived carbon. The ZIF-derived carbon (200 mg) was dispersed in 50 ml water and sonicated for 30 min. Cobalt acetate (177 mg) and 1,10-phenanthroline (594.6 mg) were dissolved in 15 ml of water. Then, 1 ml of this solution was added to the ZIF-derived carbon solution and the mixture was sonicated for another 30 min, followed by stirring for 24 h. After this, the powder was collected by filtration and was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The dried powder was annealed at 900 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere to produce Co

Characterization
Transition electron microscopy images were acquired on a spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (JEM ARM-200F, JEOL) at the National Center for Inter-University Research Facilities at Seoul National University. X-ray diffraction patterns were acquired using a D/MAX-2500 Rigaku powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation). The Raman spectra were taken by LabRAM HR Evolution (HORIBA). FTIR spectra were obtained using a Bruker model Vertex 80/80v. Samples were pelletized with KBr and the data were collected over 4,000–750 cm
−1
(number of scans, 32; resolution, 4). SEM images were acquired using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM 7800F Prime; JEOL). The metal contents were characterized by inductively coupled plasma–absorption emission microscopy (OPTIMA 8300, Perkin-Elmer). XPS measurements were conducted using the K-Alpha
+
XPS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the Busan Center of the Korea Basic Science Institute. The X-ray source was 1,486.6 eV monochromated Al Kα (X-ray energy of 12 kV, 72 W) and the spot size was 400 um. The peaks were fitted using XPS peak 4.1 software.
FTIR analysis
The temperature-dependent evolution of oxygen functional groups on the Co–N
4
/graphene SAC was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig.
2h
). For pristine GO, various oxygen-containing functional groups, which include hydroxyls (broad peak at 3,140–3,700 cm
−1
), C=O (1,730 cm
−1
), C=C (1,625 cm
−1
) and ethers and epoxides (1,000–1,300 cm
−1
) were observed
33
. For simplicity, we assigned the two main peaks as follows: region I for the hydroxyls (water, C–OH and C–OOH) and region II for ethers and epoxides (C–O–C). For pristine GO and Co
1
–NG(R), the hydroxyl peak (region I) is dominant, whereas the ethers and epoxide groups become more prominent for Co
1
–NG(O) (refs.
26
,
28
).
X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements
XAFS were acquired at the 8C nano-probe XAFS beamline (BL8C) of Pohang Light Source II. The incident beam was monochromatized by a Si(111) crystal and detuned 30% to minimize the higher harmonics. An energy calibration was conducted before the measurement using reference foil. XAFS spectra were collected in both transmission and fluorescence modes. The obtained spectra were processed using Demeter software. EXAFS spectra were fitted in a Fourier-transform range of 3–11 Å
−1
with a Hanning window applied between 1 and 2.5 Å. The EXAFS curve was fitted using the metal phthalocyanine structure with an M–N
4
unit as the reference. The amplitude reduction factor (
S
0
2
) was set to 0.86 during the fitting.
NEXAFS was measured at the 4D PES II beamline (BL4D) of Pohang Light Source II. The sample powders were loaded in an ultrahigh vacuum (base pressure, 1 × 10
−10
torr). Total electron yield NEXAFS spectra were recorded at a 55° angle of X-ray incidence at the sample surface. The acquired spectra were normalized to the incident photon flux and calibrated with the gold-mesh flux monitor currents. The Beagle software was used for subtraction of the background.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical H
2
O
2
production was performed using a conventional three-electrode cell with a RRDE set-up (Pine Instruments Corporation) and Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT302N). A RRDE electrode with a glassy carbon electrode (0.2475 cm
2
area) and a platinum ring electrode was used as the working electrode. Prior to measurement, the working electrode was polished mechanically with alumina suspension (Buehler) and rinsed with deionized water. A Ag/AgCl electrode and graphite rod were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. To prepare the ink, as-synthesized catalysts (0.5 mg) were mixed in 1 ml of solution that contained 975 μl of isopropanol and 25 μl of 5% Nafion solution, followed by ultrasonication for 10 min to form homogeneous inks. Catalyst-coated electrodes were prepared through a spin-coating process. The catalyst ink (4.95 μl of was then drop-casted onto a disk electrode of the RRDE tip spinning at an initial rate of 150 rpm and advanced to 400 rpm to achieve uniform electrode coverage. The electrode-catalyst loading was 10 μg cm
−2
. It is important to perform H
2
O
2
production studies with a thin layer of catalysts (a lower loading, such as ~10 μg cm
−2
) on the electrode rather than thick catalyst layers, in which the peroxide formed is usually quenched within the catalysts layer and hence not being detected at the ring electrode. A total of three electrolytes with pH ~13 (0.1 M KOH), ~7.4 (0.1 M PBS) and ~1 (0.1 M HClO
4
) were used at 298 K. All the potentials were versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Before the ORR measurement, we conducted the precycling steps with 50 potential sweeps from 0.05 to 1.0 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s
−1
in an Ar-saturated electrolytes, in which a stable cyclic voltammogram shape was obtained. Then, the H
2
O
2
productivity and selectivity were obtained from polarization curves in O
2
-saturated conditions between 0.05 and 1.0 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s
−1
at 1,600 r.p.m. while holding the potential of the platinum ring electrode at 1.2 V. The ORR current was corrected by subtracting the current obtained in an Ar-saturated electrolyte from that measured in O
2
-saturated conditions. All the measured ring currents were also corrected using the collection efficiency,
N
, of RRDE set-up to obtain the overall current density as all the H
2
O
2
generated was detected. The ring collection efficiency was empirically determined using a well-behaved redox system in a solution that contained a small concentration (~2 mM) of [Fe(CN)
6
]
3−/4−
solution (
N
= 0.356; Supplementary Fig.
24
). Accordingly, the H
2
O
2
selectivity was calculated using the equation:
$${\mathrm{Selectivity}}\left( \% \right) = 200 \times (I_{\rm{r}}/N)/(I_{\rm{d}} + I_{\rm{r}}/N)$$
(1)
where
I
r
and
I
d
denote the ring current and disk current, respectively. The kinetic current (
I
k
) was extracted by correcting the mass transport losses, according to the equation:
$$1/I_{\rm{m}} = 1/I_{\rm{l}} + 1/I_{\rm{k}}$$
(2)
where
I
m
indicates the measured total current and
I
l
is the diffusion-limited current. Usually, it is difficult to determine the value of the limiting current, usually determined from the highest steady current measured in the entire potential range, in most of the carbonaceous catalysts. Thus, we calculated the limiting current from the Levich equations with the total electron transfer number (
n
) obtained from our RRDE system. The Levich equation is:
$$I_l = 0.62\,nFAD_{\rm{o}}^{2/3}\omega ^{1/2}\upsilon ^{ - 1/6}C_{\rm{o}}$$

H

2
concentration measurement and the durability test
To quantitate the amount of H
2
O
2
molecules and achieve high peroxide concentrations, we performed the electrochemical ORR in an H-type cell with an alkaline membrane (Selemion AMV, Asahi Glass Co. Ltd) as the separator. The volume of the three-port chamber (working electrode and Ag/AgCl (RE-1CP, ALS) as a reference electrode) and the two-port chamber (graphite rod as a counter electrode) of the cell were both ~ 25 ml and we filled each cell with 15 ml of 0.1 M KOH electrolyte during each experiment. To avoid the decomposition of H
2
O
2
, 10 mM EDTA was added as an inhibitor to the 0.1 M KOH electrolyte
33
. To prepare the electrodes, the same catalyst ink was sprayed using an airbrush onto the Teflon-treated carbon paper (1 cm × 1 cm, Toray, TGPH090) with catalyst loading of ~1 mg cm
−2
. The electrolyte in the cathode compartment was bubble with pure O
2
gas and stirred by a magnetics stirring apparatus to guarantee that the reactant can reach the electrode surface. The polarization curves (with infrared compensation) were obtained with the linear sweep voltammetry method (10 mV s
–1
). In practical applications, the device is more likely to be operated under a constant potential or current. Thus, the long-term stability tests for our cobalt single-atom based catalysts were conducted in both the RRDE set-up (chronoamperometry at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, rotation speed of 1,600 r.p.m.) and the H-cell system (chronopotentiometry methods under a constant current of 50 mA).
The H
2
O
2
concentrations in the electrolytes were measured by titrating with standard ceric sulfate solution, Ce(SO
4
)
2
, which is appropriate to characterize the peroxide content in aqueous solutions. The reaction of the yellow-coloured Ce

to the colourless Ce

proceeds in the presence of H

, which can be measured by ultraviolet–infrared spectroscopy (read between 300 and 800 nm; Supplementary Fig.

32
:
$${\rm{H}}_2{\rm{O}}_2 + 2{\rm{Ce}}\left( {{\rm{SO}}_4} \right)_2 \to {\rm{Ce}}_2\left( {{\rm{SO}}_4} \right)_3 + {\rm{H}}_2{\rm{SO}}_4 + {\rm{O}}_2$$

ions (or H

O
2
). Various volumes of 0.1 wt% peroxide solutions were added to the ceric sulfate solution and the absorbance measured with ultraviolet–infrared spectroscopy. By linear interpolation, the concentration of H
2
O
2
in the electrolyte was calculated, and then a certain volume of the electrolyte (under a constant current of 50 mA for 30 min and several hours in a H-type cell) was added to the same Ce(SO

2
titrant solution.
DFT calculation details
Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the VASP software package
43
with PAW pseudopotentials
44
and the RPBE functional
45
. The very fast (RMM-DIIS) algorithm, accurate precision and 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack
k
-point mesh
46
were used for all the calculations with an energy cutoff of 500 eV and a Gaussian smearing of smearing width 0.1 eV. Slab models were built with supercells that contained 1 metal atom, 4 nitrogen atoms and 54 carbon atoms, which were separated by 20 Å of vacuum space perpendicular to the slab surface. All the atoms were relaxed until the energy change was less than 10
−5
eV for the electronic relaxation and the forces on each atom were less than 0.03 eV Å
−1
for the ionic relaxation. All the adsorption energies were referenced to gas-phase H
2
O and H
2
. Free energies were obtained by applying zero-point energy and entropic corrections to the calculated DFT energies. The corrections, taken from previous studies
47
,
48
, were +0.05 eV, +0.35 eV and +0.40 eV for O*, OH* and OOH*, respectively, and they were used independent of the catalyst materials. We also included a correction to account for the water-induced stabilization of OH* and OOH*, which corresponds to 0.3 eV per adsorbate
