Abstract
Single noble metal atoms and ultrafine metal clusters catalysts tend to sinter into aggregated particles at elevated temperatures, driven by the decrease of metal surface free energy. Herein, we report an unexpected phenomenon that noble metal nanoparticles (Pd, Pt, Au-NPs) can be transformed to thermally stable single atoms (Pd, Pt, Au-SAs) above 900 °C in an inert atmosphere. The atomic dispersion of metal single atoms was confirmed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structures. The dynamic process was recorded by in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy, which showed competing sintering and atomization processes during NP-to-SA conversion. Further, density functional theory calculations revealed that high-temperature NP-to-SA conversion was driven by the formation of the more thermodynamically stable Pd-N
4
structure when mobile Pd atoms were captured on the defects of nitrogen-doped carbon. The thermally stable single atoms (Pd-SAs) exhibited even better activity and selectivity than nanoparticles (Pd-NPs) for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene.

. However, noble metals of particularly small size (single atoms or ultrafine nanoparticles) have the tendency to aggregate into larger particles at elevated temperature due to their excess surface free energy, which is known as thermal deactivation or sintering

The mechanism of metal sintering is typically attributed to the migration of atomic metal species between nanoparticles or the coalescence of neighbouring metal nanoparticles. These two pathways may both exist during sintering, especially at high temperatures. Introducing strong metal–support interactions or ligands to thermodynamically stabilize metal atoms are effective approaches to reduce the surface energy and the tendency of metal atom migration
24
,
25
. However, some strong ligands themselves may become poisoning factors that deactivate catalysts
26
. Another class of strategies have been proposed to kinetically prevent the collision and coalescence of metal nanoparticles by confining them within microporous solids such as zeolites and metal–organic frameworks
27
,
28
,
29
. Nevertheless, this strategy cannot hinder the atomic metal species migration owing to their relative large pore diameter in comparison to metal atoms
30
. If we can reverse the sintering of metal nanoparticles and convert nanoparticles into single atomic sites, the catalyst performance will probably improve

Herein, we report the successful reversion of sintering effects and the conversion of noble metal nanoparticles into thermally stable highly active single atoms (Pd, Pt, Au). We utilized nitrogen-doped carbon (CN) derived from a metal–organic framework (zeolite imidazolate framework-8, ZIF-8)
14
,
35
as the anchoring substrate to capture the migrating metal atoms at high temperatures. In the movie recorded by in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM), we observed that sintering can still occur and larger Pd nanoparticles will form at high temperatures. However, the enlarged Pd-NPs would intensively collide with the substrate, gradually become smaller and finally transforming to single atoms (Supplementary Video
1
). The obtained thermally stable Pd-SAs showed even better catalytic activity and selectivity than Pd-NPs for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene.
Discovery of Pd nanoparticles converting to single atoms
Nanoparticle-to-single atom transformation was discovered in palladium. As shown in Fig.
1
, we grew ZIF-8 nanocrystals on Pd-NPs (Supplementary Fig.
1
) by mixing the Pd-NPs, Zn(NO
3
)
2
solution with 2-methylimidazole solution. The ZIF-8 crystal can grow around the Pd-NPs to form Pd-NPs@ZIF-8 composites (Fig.
1a
, Supplementary Figs.
2
and
3
). Then the Pd-NPs@ZIF-8 nanocomposites were heated at 900 °C under an inert atmosphere for 3 h, after which the Pd-NPs disappeared (Fig.
1a–d
). We shortened the pyrolysing time and analysed the intermediates using high-resolution high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). In the first 0.5 h of heating, the crystalline Pd-NPs grew larger (intermediate I, Fig.
1b
inset and Supplementary Fig.
4
) and the size distribution became inhomogeneous (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
5
). After 1.5 h, the number of nanoparticles decreased obviously (Fig.
1c
and Supplementary Fig.
6
) and the crystalline Pd nanoparticles were transformed into amorphous state (intermediate II, Fig.
1c
inset and Supplementary Fig.
7
). With the extension of pyrolysing time (3 h), the remaining nanoparticles were fully digested within the substrate (Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
8
). Meanwhile the Pd-NPs vanished, ZIF-8 was decomposed and converted to nitrogen-doped carbon as suggested in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Supplementary Fig.
9
) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary Fig.
10
).

We carefully examined the HAADF-STEM images of the Pd sample after 3 h pyrolysis at 900 °C and confirmed the absence of Pd clusters and small crystals (Supplementary Fig.
8
). However, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurements showed Pd remained in pyrolysed sample (Supplementary Table
1
) and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed Pd, C and N were evenly distributed over the whole nanostructure (Fig.
1e
). When checking pyrolysed sample with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy in randomly selected regions, we surprisingly found single Pd atoms were homogeneously distributed on CN supports. The heavier isolated Pd atoms can be readily discerned in the CN supports, which are labelled with white circles in Fig.
1f
and Supplementary Fig.
11
.
To further confirm that Pd atoms were atomically dispersed on the supports, we performed extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements (Fig.
1g
and Supplementary Fig.
12
). The EXAFS curve of Pd-NPs showed a peak around 2.5 Å attributed to Pd–Pd bonds whereas Pd-SAs had only one dominant peak around 1.5 Å attributed to Pd–N bonds (Supplementary Table
2
), verifying the sole presence of atomically dispersed Pd atoms (Fig.
1g
). We also collected the EXAFS curves of Pd samples pyrolysed at different temperatures (Supplementary Fig.
13
). The coexistence of the Pd–Pd and Pd–N bonds in the EXAFS curve of Pd/CN-700 (Pd-NPs@ZIF-8 pyrolysed at 700 °C for 3 h) indicated the atomization of Pd-NPs initiated at 700 °C. The intensity of Pd–Pd peak decreased due to amorphization of a small fraction of Pd-NPs, which was also evidenced by high-resolution HAADF-STEM analysis (Supplementary Fig.
14
).
Nanoparticle to single atom transformation for Pt and Au
Inspired by this phenomenon, we wondered whether NP-to-SA transformation was also applicable to other catalytically active noble metals, such as Pt and Au. As shown in the high-resolution HAADF-STEM images, the crystalline Pt-NPs and Au-NPs (Fig.
2a,d
) can be successfully dispersed to single atomic sites after pyrolysis, which are indicated by white circles in Fig.
2b,e
. The ICP-OES measurements (Supplementary Table
1
) confirmed the existence of Pt and Au in calcined samples. The EXAFS spectra before and after pyrolysis indicated the Pt–Pt bonds of Pt-NPs and the Au–Au bonds of Au-NPs were converted to Pt–N and Au–N respectively, demonstrating the NPs were converted to SAs after heat treatments (Fig.
2c,f
). These results demonstrated that NP-to-SA transformation was not an individual phenomenon but a shared route to downsize metal-NPs to SAs. In general, metal-NPs tended to sinter at high temperatures giving us a strong suspicion of the reason for the transformation.

Mechanism of nanoparticle to single atom conversions
To understand the NP-to-SA conversion mechanism, we used in situ ETEM to observe the atomization process (Supplementary Video
1
). The evolution from Pd-NPs to Pd-SAs was traced in the temperature window from 100 °C to 1,000 °C under an Ar atmosphere of 0.578 mbar. Representative movie images acquired at different temperatures and statistical analysis of particle diameters and numbers are shown in Fig.
3a–c
. The average diameter of Pd-NPs steadily increased from room temperature to 900 °C, meanwhile the number of Pd-NPs gradually decreased (Fig.
3b
and Supplementary Fig.
15
), indicating the sintering and atomization coexisted during NP-to-SA transformation. Notably, compared with the initial Pd-NPs@ZIF-8, the dimension of the CN nanostructure shrank significantly at 900 °C (Fig.
3a
, 900 °C, the dashed hexagon represents the original size), probably due to the structural collapse of the CN after zinc evaporation.

As the temperature was increased to 1,000 °C, agglomeration and atomization were both accelerated (Supplementary Video
1
). In the marginal location of ZIF-8-derived CN nanostructure where the Pd-NPs were sparsely distributed, the Pd-NPs can be directly atomized. For example, the Pd-NP marked by a white arrow in 1,000 °C 0 s vanished in situ after 36 s (Fig.
3a
, 1,000 °C 0 s and 36 s). These nanoparticles were supposed to emit Pd atoms (considering the relative high vapour pressure of ultrafine Pd-NPs at 900 °C), and the mobile Pd atoms were subsequently captured by N defects on CN. Differently, in the central position where the NPs were densely distributed, the NPs tended to sinter into larger particles before being atomized. As we can see in the central position of CN marked by the white square (25 nm × 25 nm), small Pd-NPs sintered into one large Pd-NP with a diameter of 6.5 nm (Fig.
3a
, 1,000 °C 0 s to 1,000 °C 74 s). After disorderly movement and intensive collision within the supports (Supplementary Movie
1
), the only Pd-NP with a diameter of 6.5 nm was downsized to 4.0 nm at 136 s and to 1.9 nm at 150 s continually, and vanished at 162 s eventually (Fig.
3a,c
). It is necessary for sintered Pd-NPs (~6 nm) to undergo thermal motions within CN, being downsized by the coordination of surface Pd with the N defects before final atomization, since the emission of Pd atoms will be suppressed due to the decreased vapour pressure of larger metal particles
36
. By comparison, when we heated the Pd-NPs on surface of ZIF sample, the sintered Pd-NPs cannot be atomized (Supplementary Fig.
16
), which strongly suggested that the thermal motion of large Pd particles within CN played a key role in reducing the size of sintered Pd-NPs. Once the size was decreased again (through collision and coordination of surface Pd with CN), the vapour pressure increased and the emission and capture of Pd atoms pathway can once again become the major contribution of NP-to-SA transformation. The in situ observation of ETEM provided solid and direct evidence of the evolution from Pd-NPs to Pd-SAs and the coexistence of two competitive atomization and agglomeration processes, in which the atomization won eventually.
In essence, the competition of atomization and sintering reflected the competitive bonding between Pd–N and Pd–Pd. We speculated that the thermodynamically stable coordination of Pd with N atoms probably provided the driving force for atomization. To figure out the driving force of NP-to-SA, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the mechanism. We investigated various possible Pd complexes and ascertained that Pd coordinated with two pyrrolic N and two pyridinic N at the defects of graphene was the most stable one (Supplementary Fig.
17
). XANES simulations, which had high sensitivity to the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms around the photoabsorber, were carried out at Pd K-edge to further identify the local structure of Pd-SAs. As we showed in Supplementary Fig.
18
, the simulated XANES spectrum based on the structure model (PdN
4
) agreed well with the experimental one. The features for the experimental spectrum were correctly reproduced. Combining EXAFS fitting, XANES simulations and DFT calculations, the atomic structure (PdN
4
) of Pd-SA was established. The anchoring effects of nitrogen atoms were also verified by a controlled experiment. When we pyrolyzed Pd-NPs loaded on carbon (Pd-NPs/C) under the same conditions, the Pd-NPs sintered into larger particles instead of transforming to Pd-SAs (Supplementary Fig.
19
). Notably, the structure of Pd-N
4
share some degree of similarity with previously reported transition non-noble metal-N
4
(Fe, Co) atomic structure, which means the noble metal NP-to-SA strategy will broaden the research scope of conventional metal-N
4
materials
37
,
38
. We adopted Pd
10
as an example to investigate the competition between the atomization and sintering (Fig.
3d
). The formation of a single Pd atom in the N
4
defect from decomposition of the Pd
10
cluster requires a barrier of 1.47 eV to be overcome, but with a large exothermicity of 3.96 eV. On the other hand, the sintering was also an exothermic process and would happen spontaneously when two Pd clusters were close enough
39
. The barrier for such a sintering process was just the diffusion barrier of a single Pd cluster, which was calculated to be only 0.58 eV. Therefore, sintering was dominant at relatively low-temperature (~300–900 °C) and atomization dominated at high temperature (~900–1,000 °C), because the latter required inputted energy to overcome the 1.47 eV kinetic barrier.
Catalytic reactivity of Pd-SAs and Pd-NPs
Inspiringly, the obtained thermally stable Pd-SAs showed enhanced catalytic reactivity in the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene, which is an important industrial process to purify the acetylene-contaminated ethylene feed for the production of polyethylene
40
. The acetylene conversion of Pd-SAs reached a value of 96.0% with high selectivity to ethylene (93.4%) at 120 °C. Comparatively, Pd-NPs/CN showed lower activity and selectivity. They only converted 70.1% acetylene with 71.8% selectivity at 120 °C. When acetylene conversion of Pd-NPs/CN reached 100% at 140 °C, the selectivity dropped to 47.2%. We also tested the catalytic performances of Pd catalysts that were obtained by pyrolyzing Pd-NPs@ZIF at ~600–800 °C. The catalytic performances improved with the increasing pyrolysis temperatures (Fig.
4a,b
), suggesting the increased proportion of the atomically dispersed Pd led to better catalytic reactivity. The stability of Pd-SAs under a reducing atmosphere was confirmed by characterization of Pd-SAs after catalysis and after reduction by 5% H
2
/Ar at 900 °C for 3 h. The high-resolution HAADF-STEM images and EXAFS of Pd-SAs showed the Pd remained atomically dispersed after catalysis and reducing treatment (Supplementary Fig.
20
). The XPS of Pd-SAs exhibited no positive or negative peak shift on the binding energy, indicating the Pd-SAs were still partially positively charged after catalytic reactions and harsh reducing treatment (Supplementary Fig.
21
).

DFT calculations were performed to illustrate the reason why the Pd-SAs had such better catalytic performance than Pd-NPs. As shown in Fig.
5a,b
, hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane on Pd-SAs requires two barriers of 0.93 and 1.22 eV to be overcome (TS3 and TS4 in Fig.
5a
). The location of TS4 was 0.89 eV above the ethylene line. Thus, further hydrogenation was forbidden at Pd-SAs sites. On the contrary, acetylene and ethylene could coordinate with several Pd atoms of the Pd(111) surface (Fig.
5b
). Chemical adsorption energy of ethylene was 0.76 eV, whereas its hydrogenation barriers were only 0.62 and 0.35 eV, located below the ethylene line. Therefore, further hydrogenation from ethylene to ethane would dominate the whole process on Pd-NPs, and thus leaded to lower selectivity of ethylene. On the Pd(111) surface that is assumed as the dominant surface of Pd-NPs, the adsorption energies of C

H
2
and H
2
are very different, with –1.33 and –0.24 eV, respectively. This means that most of the sites on the Pd surface are occupied by C

Conclusions
We discovered the atomization effects of noble metals (Pd, Pt, Au). This discovery established a convenient top-down route to obtain single-atom catalysts from nanoparticles, which may even be applied to reactivate sintered industrial noble metal nanocatalysts by redispersing them into single atomic sites, providing valuable insights for preparing high-performance thermally stable catalysts.

Then, we added flask B into flask A at room temperature and kept the temperature constant for 12 h without stirring. The obtained pure ZIF-8 powder was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 r.p.m. for 5 min and washed with methanol three times and dried at 70 °C for 5 h. Then, we mixed the pure ZIF-8 powder with 0.5 ml as-prepared Pd nanoparticles dispersed in DMF:methanol solution (~1 mg

Preparation of PVP-free Pd-NPs supported on ZIF-8-derived N-doped carbon (Pd-NPs/CN)
First, ZIF-8-derived N-doped carbon (CN) was obtained by pyrolysing ZIF-8 powder at 900 °C for 3 h under inert atmosphere. Then, the PVP-protected Pd-NPs methanol solution (~1 mg

Characterization
We investigated the crystalline structure and phase purity by Rigaku RU-200b XRD with CuKα radiation (
λ
= 1.5418 Å). We measured the metal concentration of the metal-SAs by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). XPS experiments were performed on a ULVAC PHI Quantera microprobe and the Photoemission Endstation at the BL10B beamline in the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in Hefei, China. Binding energies (BE) were calibrated by setting the measured BE of C 1
s
to 284.8 eV. We analysed the catalysts’ sizes and morphologies by a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope (TEM) and collected the elemental maps by JEOL JEM-2100F field emission electron microscope. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy characterizations were performed using a probe aberration corrected microscope JEOL JEM-ARM200CF microscope, with 25 mrad incident beam and collection angle between 90 mrad and 370 mrad for HAADF acquisition. The size of HAADF-STEM images was 1,024 × 1,024 with 5 μs dwell time of each pixel. The probe current was 100 pA and probe size 0.78 Å, so the electron dose rate was approximately 6.54 × 10
3
electrons per Å
2
, which was sufficiently low for TEM mode and to not cause beam damage.
In situ environmental microscopic study
The in situ environmental microscopic study is performed on a Titan ETEM microscope (FEI) operated at 300 kV equipped with an image Cs-corrector. The sampling nanoparticles are diluted in isopropanol and dispersed with ultrasonic. Then the solution is cast on a MEMS in situ heating chip, blow dried with dry air and mounted on a functional TEM holder (DENSsolutions, wildfire). To avoid cross pollution, both the chip and the sample holder were plasma cleaned by 30 min. After casting, the chip and the holder were again cleaned by UV for 5 min under 35 mbar vacuum to remove the residual organics. The gaseous environment was created inside the ETEM column with pure Ar (99.9995%) and heated by the MEMS heater integrated on the chip. To reduce the irradiation effect, several NPs were tested under different beam doses. We found that above a dose of 1.16 e Å
–2
S
–1
the structure of the CN could be slightly undermined, because of which all in situ results were acquired below this dose. Moreover, to minimize the dose effect, apart from data requiring time (~0.3–0.5 sec per time), the beam was always blanked during stages including the gas injection, temperature ramping and so on.
XAFS measurements and data processing
We collected XAFS spectra at the BL14W1 station of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, operated at 3.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA, Pd K-edge and Au L
3
-edge) and the 1W1B station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF, operated at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA, Pt L
3
-edge), respectively. We collected the XAFS data of metal-NPs and metal-SAs samples in fluorescence mode. We pelletized all samples as disks of 13 mm diameter with 1 mm thickness by using graphite powder as binder for metal-NP samples and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) powder as binder for metal-SA samples. All spectra were collected in ambient conditions.
We processed the acquired EXAFS data according to the standard procedures by using the ATHENA module of the IFEFFIT software packages. We obtained the EXAFS spectra by post-edge background subtraction from the overall absorption and normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step. Then,
χ
(
k
) data were Fourier transformed to real (
R
) space by utilization of a Hanning window (d
k
= 1.0 Å
–1
) for separating the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. Least-squares curve parameter fitting was carried out by utilizing the ARTEMIS module of the IFEFFIT software packages to obtain the quantitative structural parameters around central atoms
45
.
The following EXAFS equation was used:
$$\chi \left( k \right) = \mathop {\sum}\limits_j {\frac{{\mathop {N}\nolimits_j \mathop {S}\nolimits_0^2 \mathop {F}\nolimits_j \left( k \right)}}{{k\mathop {R}\nolimits_j^2 }}} \exp \left[ { - 2\mathop {k}\nolimits^2 \mathop {\sigma }\nolimits_j^2 } \right]\exp \left[ {\frac{{ - 2\mathop {R}\nolimits_j }}{{\lambda \left( k \right)}}} \right]\sin \left[ {2k\mathop {R}\nolimits_j + \mathop {\varphi }\nolimits_j \left( k \right)} \right]$$

Catalytic evaluation
We investigated the catalytic performances of the samples by a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz-glass microreactor (i.d. = 6 mm). The Pd-SAs catalyst containing 1.6 mg palladium (determined by ICP-OES measurement) was mixed with 2.0 g quarters sands (40–60 mesh). The Pd-NPs supported on ZIF-8-derived CN containing 1.6 mg palladium (determined by ICP-OES measurement) was mixed with 2.0 g quarters sands (40–60 mesh). The reactant gas containing 0.5 vol% C

capillary column (50 m, 0.25 mm) which was connected to flame ionization detector to analyse hydrocarbons, Poropak-Q and RT-Msieve 5A columns which were connected to a thermal conductivity detector to analyse hydrocarbons and other permanent gases. The catalytic performances of Pd/CN-600, Pd/CN-700 and Pd/CN-800 were detected under the same conditions.
We calculated acetylene conversion and ethylene selectivity as follow:
$${\mathrm{Conversion}} = \frac{{C}_{{{\mathrm{feed}}} - C_x}}{{C_{\mathrm{feed}}}} \times 100$$
(2)
$${\mathrm{Selectivity}} = \frac{{C_{{\mathrm{feed}}} - C_x}}{{C}_{\mathrm{feed} - C_x + C_{{\mathrm{ethane}}} + 2 \times C_{\mathrm{C}_4{\mathrm{H}}_x}}} \times 100$$

hydrocarbons in the same way. No higher hydrocarbons than C
