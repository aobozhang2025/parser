Abstract
The electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) has attracted a surge of research interest in sustainably producing high-value multi-carbon products, such as acetate. Nevertheless, most current CORR catalysts exhibit low acetate current densities, poor longevity and limited acetate selectivity. Here we present a Zeolite Socony Mobil-confined Cu single-atom cluster (CuZSM SACL) for CORR, in which Cu SAs are chemically anchored via robust Cu–O–Si bonds while Cu CLs are physically trapped within the porous framework of zeolite cavities. Consequently, the CuZSM SACL-containing membrane electrode assembly enables a remarkable CO-to-acetate current density of 1.8 A cm
−
2
with a high acetate Faraday efficiency of 71 ± 3%. More importantly, we demonstrate that the Cu-based membrane electrode assembly can stably catalyse CO to acetate at an industrial current density of 1 A cm
−
2
at 2.7 V (Faraday efficiency 61 ± 5%) beyond 1,000 h at atmospheric pressure. This milestone sheds light on high-performing Cu-type catalysts for practical CORR applications.

Main
Acetic acid is a crucial industrial chemical that holds vital economic value owing to its immense annual demand (>18 million tonnes) in the production of various chemicals, such as terephthalic acid and vinyl acetate
1
,
2
,
3
. The industrial process of producing acetic acid primarily relies on fossil fuels, which necessitates the use of high temperatures and pressures, leading to massive CO
2
emissions and energy consumption
4
. The electroreduction of CO
2
or CO offers an appealing near-zero-emission approach to sustainably produce acetic acid at low temperature, which has caught extensive attention in the pursuit of carbon neutrality
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
. However, direct CO
2
-to-acetate electroreduction demands high overpotential (>6 V) and poses an intractable carbonate accumulation issue under alkaline conditions
9
,
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
. Recently, a two-step tandem system has been proposed by pairing the CO
2
-to-CO with CO-to-C
2+
reactions
14
,
15
,
16
. That is, CO
2
can be efficiently converted into CO through a high-temperature solid oxide electrolyser
17
. Subsequently, CO can be further converted into multi-carbon products by an alkaline CO reduction reaction (CORR) electrolyser.
Nonetheless, most current CORR electrolysers exhibited poor acetate activity (<0.3 A cm
−
2
) and longevity, along with limited acetate Faraday efficiency (FE). Years of study have reached a consensus that copper (Cu) is the most efficient catalyst for CO-to-acetate conversion
18
,
19
. However, conventional Cu is structurally unstable and is susceptible to the hydrogen evolution reaction
20
. Many efforts have been devoted to designing different types of Cu catalyst, intending to boost the selectivity and current density of CO-to-acetate conversion. Typically, Wu et al. reported a Cu nanoparticle that delivered a stable CO-to-acetate conversion at 0.4 A cm
−
2
for 40 h with an FE of 56% (ref.
21
). Ji et al. presented a Cu–Pd-containing membrane electrode assembly (MEA) that enabled a 500 h CO-to-acetate conversion at 0.5 A cm
−
2
at 3.5 V with an FE of 50% (ref.
22
). Jin et al. reported that Cu–Ag alloys achieved a high CO-to-acetate FE of 85–91% under a 10 bar backpressure
23
, while the stability test of MEA was performed at 0.1 A cm
−
2
. Although the FE of CO-to-acetate conversion has been substantially improved, the state-of-the-art CORR electrolysers can be only operated at low current densities <0.5 A cm
−
2
with high overpotential (>3.5 V) and limited longevity.
Zeolite molecular sieves have been widely used in thermocatalytic reactions, as they can induce a strong metal–support interaction, thereby stabilizing metal catalysts while enhancing the activity
24
,
25
,
26
. Here we present a unique Zeolite Socony Mobil-confined Cu single-atom cluster (CuZSM SACL) for CORR, in which Cu SAs and Cu CLs can synergistically facilitate asymmetric C–C coupling to substantially facilitate the CORR efficiency and stability. Within this structure, the robust Cu–O–Si bond can be formed, which effectively stabilizes Cu SAs within the ZSM cavity. In addition, the confinement effect of zeolite cavity can inhibit the growth and aggregation of Cu CLs. These merits endow CuZSM SACL with excellent CORR activity and stability. Consequently, the CuZSM SACL-based MEA achieves an exceptional partial current density of acetate (1.15 A cm
−
2
) with a high acetate FE of 71 ± 3% at atmospheric pressure. More importantly, we demonstrate that Cu-based MEA electrolysers are able to stably catalyse CO to acetate at an industrial current density of 1 A cm
−
2
at 2.7 V for over 1,000 h. This important milestone highlights the tremendous potential of these CuZSM SACLs for practical CORR applications, making the electrochemical production of acetate visible.
Preparation and characterization
ZSM-confined Cu single atoms (CuZSM SAs) were prepared using an ion exchange approach involving CuSO
4
and ZSM in an ethanol aqueous solution. Subsequently, the ZSM-confined CuZSM SACL was obtained by further treating CuZSM SA with hydrogen (Fig.
1a
). ZSM-confined Cu CLs and nanoparticles (CuZSM CLNPs) were obtained by directly treating CuSO
4
with ZSM under hydrogen atmosphere. Sodium and hydrogen ZSM-5 (NaZSM-5 and HZSM-5) were utilized as supports for CuZSM, and the NaZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 has an excellent CORR performance, which is deemed as the optimal support for CuZSM series (Supplementary Fig.
1
). CuZSM catalysts with a Cu content of 1% show the highest CO-to-acetate efficiency and selectivity (Supplementary Fig.
2
).

Low-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that the surface of CuZSM SA and CuZSM SACL is similar to that of pristine ZSM. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) element mapping indicate that Cu species exist in the form of SAs or CLs (Supplementary Figs.
3
–
5
). By contrast, distinct Cu NPs can be clearly observed in CuZSM CLNP (Supplementary Fig.
6
). Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM (AC-HAADF-STEM) shows that only isolated, dense and bright dots are observed in CuZSM SA, which are ascribed to Cu SAs (blue circle) (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
7a
). As a contrast, the coexistence of a large number of Cu SAs (blue circle) and CLs (yellow circle) is clearly observed in CuZSM SACL, where the CLs exhibit trivial lattice fringes (Fig.
1c
and Supplementary Fig.
7b
). The average gap size between SAs and CLs can be estimated on a sub-nanometre scale (Supplementary Fig.
7b
3
,b
4
). Conversely, Cu CLs and NPs with a size of approximately 10 nm are visible in CuZSM CLNP (Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
7c
). Meanwhile, the densities of Cu SAs and CLs within CuZSM SA and CuZSM SACL can be estimated based on representative AC-HAADF-STEM images (Supplementary Figs.
8
and
9
, and Supplementary Tables
1
and
2
). In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all CuZSM catalysts exhibit a characteristic ZSM diffraction peak between 20° and 30° (ICDD number 00-044-0003), indicating the complete retention of the Mobil-type Five (MFI) topology during the synthesis process (Supplementary Fig.
10
). The overall left shift of the ZSM peak in Fig.
1e
indicates that Cu species have been successfully incorporated into the ZSM structure. Notably, CuZSM SA exhibits an identical crystal structure to ZSM, suggesting that Cu atoms are highly dispersed within the ZSM. The peak intensities of Cu (111) and Cu (200) (ICDD number 00-004-0836) increase in both CuZSM SACL and CuZSM CLNP, indicating the presence of Cu CLs or NPs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the intensity of Cu
0/+
peak gradually raises in CuZSM SA, CuZSM SACL and CuZSM CLNP, while the intensity of Cu
2+
peak correspondingly decreases, suggesting that the various Cu species are meticulously controlled (Fig.
1f
). In the Cu LMN spectrum, Cu species are assigned to Cu
+
, Cu
2+
and Cu
0
, with peak values of 916.8 eV, 917.7 eV and 918.6 eV, respectively
27
(Fig.
1g
).
Furthermore, the coordination structures of Cu species in CuZSM catalysts were further analysed by synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAS). Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra show that the absorption edges around 0.5 of CuZSM SACL and CuZSM SA are close to that of CuO, suggesting the oxidation states of Cu in CuZSM SACL and CuZSM SA. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra exhibit that CuZSM SA has a single peak at 1.6 Å (for Cu–O coordination in CuO) (Fig.
2b
), which is assigned to the oxidation of CuZSM SA
28
. Moreover, no obvious peak is observed at 2.1 Å (for Cu–Cu coordination in metallic Cu), confirming that Cu species exist as SAs in CuZSM SA. In CuZSM SACL, the peak at 1.6 Å (for Cu–O coordination in CuO) gradually decreases, accompanying an increase of the peak at 2.1 Å (for Cu–Cu coordination in metallic Cu) (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Fig.
11
), indicating the coexistence of SAs and CLs. The fitted parameters are listed in Supplementary Table
3
, which align well with the coordination results fitted by the density functional theory (DFT) model (Supplementary Fig.
12
and Supplementary Table
4
). The wavelet transforms of EXAFS spectra further demonstrate that the bonding mode of Cu species in CuZSM SACL lies between that of CuZSM SA and CuZSM CLNP (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Fig.
13
), further confirming the coexistence of Cu SAs and Cu CLs.

CORR performance in flow cell
The CORR performance of CuZSM series was first evaluated in a standard three-electrode flow cell system using 1 M KOH as the electrolyte. The linear sweep voltammetry curves show that CuZSM SACL exhibits much higher current densities towards the CORR compared with CuZSM SA and CuZSM CLNP (Fig.
3a
). Meanwhile, CuZSM SACL exhibits a favourable Tafel slope (161.6 mV dec
−1
)
29
, which is lower than that of CuZSM SA (288.2 mV dec
−1
) and CuZSM CLNP (267.1 mV dec
−1
), indicating the superior CORR kinetic rate of CuZSM SACL (Supplementary Fig.
14
). The liquid and gaseous products were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR; Supplementary Fig.
15
) and gas chromatography (GC). Similarly, CuZSM SACL demonstrates the highest acetate FE (typically 77 ± 1% at 0.3 A cm
−
2
) and turnover frequency (1,260 h
−1
) at all currents compared with CuZSM SA and CuZSM CLNP (Fig.
3b,c
). In addition, CuZSM SACL showcases a maximum acetate partial current density of 0.469 A cm
−
2
(Fig.
3d
) and a maximum acetate formation rate of 1.21 μmol s
−
1
cm
−
2
at 0.8 A cm
−
2
(Fig.
3e
). Other liquid products include a small amount of ethanol and
n
-propanol (Supplementary Table
5
). In addition, variations in the size of Cu NPs did not enhance acetate selectivity and activity on ZSM-supported catalysts (Supplementary Fig.
16
). However, CuZSM SACL demonstrates superior electrochemical surface area (ECSA)-normalized acetate formation rate, surpassing both CuZSM SA and CuZSM CLNP (Supplementary Figs.
17
and
18
). These findings elucidate that the exceptional acetate production of CuZSM SACL is due to the synergistic effect between Cu SAs and Cu CLs, rather than alterations in the particle size or surface area of the Cu catalysts. Moreover, the CuZSM SACL-based flow cell shows a stable CO-to-acetate conversion at 0.3 A cm
−
2
for 20 h (Fig.
3f
). AC-HAADF-STEM images further reveal that CuZSM SACL still exists in the form of SAs and CLs after the CORR testing without notable Cu agglomeration (Supplementary Fig.
19
). The performance of CuZSM SACL at atmospheric pressure outperforms the most state-of-the-art CORR catalysts (Fig.
3g
).

CORR performance in MEA
The CuZSM SACL-based MEA was prepared based on an Ni–Fe oxygen evolution reaction electrode and a home-made poly(aryl-co-aryl piperidinium) membrane to demonstrate the feasibility of CuZSM SACL for practical CORR electrolysis applications (Supplementary Fig.
20
). The MEA was placed into a cathode-dried CORR electrolyser
30
, and KOH solution was fed in the anode only. First, we systematically probed the effect of different parameters, including catalyst loading, KOH concentration, gas flow rate and ionomer content, on the CORR performance of the CuZSM SACL-based MEA electrolyser under atmospheric pressure conditions (Supplementary Fig.
21
). Specifically, the CuZSM SACL-based MEA with a CuZSM SACL loading of 1.5 mg cm
−
2
and an ionomer content of 20% exhibits the optimal CORR performance. As expected, a higher concentration of KOH results in higher current densities (Fig.
4a
), and the MEA operated with 5 M KOH showcases an outstanding current density of 1.7 A cm
−
2
at 3.2 V. The FEs of CuZSM SACL-based MEA are shown in Supplementary Fig.
22
and Supplementary Table
6
. The FEs of all products detected from the CuZSM SACL-based flow cell can be well reproduced in the MEA electrolyser. The CuZSM SACL-based MEA gives a highest transient FE of 71 ± 3% at 1 A cm
−
2
(Fig.
4b
). More importantly, the CuZSM SACL-based MEA can be stably operated at 1 A cm
−
2
with steady-state cell voltage (2.7 V) and FEs (61 ± 5%) for over 1,000 h (Fig.
4c
and Supplementary Table
7
). The XRD and XAS reveal that the MFI structure and robust Cu–O–Si bonds of CuZSM SACL were preserved after 1,000 h MEA stability testing, demonstrating the exceptional stability of CuZSM SACL (Supplementary Fig.
23
). Compared with the cutting-edge CORR catalysts, the CuZSM SACL-based MEA exhibits exceptional acetate current density and MEA stability (1 A cm
−
2
at 2.7 V and >1,000 h), which surpass that of all other catalysts reported hitherto (Fig.
4d
and Supplementary Table
8
). Notably, most current CORR catalysts exhibited limited steady-state acetate FEs (<50%) and activity, typically below 0.5 A cm
−
2
> 3.5 V, along with poor MEA stability (0.1–0.3 A cm
−
2
for less than 200 h) (Fig.
4e
). Few CORR electrolysers
23
exhibited high transient FEs of 85–91%, which actually demands high backpressure (10 bar) and can be only operated at a low current density of 0.1 A cm
−
2
with a high steady-state cell voltage. Our present CuZSM SACL-containing MEA enables that the electrochemical CO-to-acetate conversion can be stably achieved under an industrial current density of 1 A cm
−

with a low cell voltage under an atmospheric pressure beyond 1,000 h.

Underlying activity mechanism research
DFT calculations were utilized to further understand the underlying mechanism behind the exceptional CORR activity of CuZSM SACL, and a unique CuZSM SACL model was built (Supplementary Fig.
24
and Supplementary Table
9
). The adsorption energies of Cu SAs at different positions within the ten-membered ring were found to vary owing to the spontaneous and random nature of the ion exchange process. Among the seven possible configurations, the Cu located at the first site has the largest adsorption energy of −4.49 eV, whereas the small adsorption energy is only −3.85 eV (Fig.
5a
). Note that the adsorption energies of individual Cu SAs exhibit lower values at specific positions (Supplementary Table
10
). We found that the number of Cu SAs within the neighbouring space of the ten-membered ring is limited, with fewer than three Cu SAs being able to coexist on the ring; otherwise, they will spontaneously form CLs and aggregate in the central region rather than the inner wall of the ten-membered ring (Fig.
5b
). By contrast, the adsorption energies of Cu CLs increase with an increasing CL size (Supplementary Fig.
25
). This suggests distinct adsorption mechanisms between Cu SAs and Cu CLs, confirming the chemical Cu–O–Si bonding of Cu SAs and the physical ZSM confinement of Cu CLs. In addition, the formation of Cu CLs leads to electron cloud overlap between Si–Cu atoms, resulting in the appearance of several localized orbitals between the valance band maximum and the conduction band minimum of ZSM, lowering the energy barrier for electron transitions and enhancing the material’s conductivity (Fig.
5c
), which is consistent with our experimental results (Supplementary Fig.
26
).

Following the establishment of the molecular sieve structure model, an investigation into the acetic acid formation pathway of CuZSM SACL, CuZSM SA and CuZSM CLNP was undertaken (Fig.
5d
and Supplementary Figs.
27
and
28
). The initial phase involves the formation of
*
CO–COH, recognized as a typical dimerization reaction. By contrast, CuZSM SACL exhibits a much lower energy barrier for the transition from *CO–CO to *CO–COH (0.05 eV) compared with that of CuZSM SA (1.881 eV) and CuZSM CLNP (0.554 eV), indicating the irreplaceable role played by the synergy of Cu SAs and CLs during the dimerization process. Moreover, CuZSM SACL requires minimal additional energy, enabling subsequent steps to spontaneously proceed until the
*
CH–CO generation stage emerges as the rate-limiting step with a Gibbs free energy (Δ
G
) of 0.328 eV. Following the post-C–C coupling step, the acetic acid pathway exhibits the lowest energy barrier, so the
*
CO–COH intermediate primarily leads to
*
CH
2
–CO, rather than the intermediate of ethylene or ethanol (
*
CH–CHO) (Supplementary Figs.
29
and
30
). Remarkably, in the
*
CH
2
–CO generation phase, CuZSM SACL demonstrates the most favourable Δ
G
value of −0.956 eV, in sharp divergence from CuZSM SA (Δ
G
= −0.254 eV) and CuZSM CLNP (Δ
G
= 0.176 eV) (Supplementary Table
11
). This pivotal observation implies that the CuZSM SACL possesses the capacity to enhance the production of acetate from CO, corroborating our experimental findings (Fig.
3d
). In the pursuit of a more thorough examination of acetate activity origins, charge density difference analysis reveals that Cu atoms situated in various locations exhibit distinct electron gain/loss profiles (Fig.
5e
), resulting in variable Bader charges and ultimately affecting the energy required for the
*
CO–CO adsorption process (Fig.
5f
). CuZSM SACL shows the most favourable adsorption energy of −1.301 eV, as outlined in Supplementary Table
12
, compared with CuZSM SA (−1.899 eV) and CuZSM CLNP (−0.450 eV). This appropriate adsorption energy facilitates the effective adsorption and hydrogenation of
*
CO, followed by timely desorption to yield the desired product. Notably, upon
*
CO adsorption, the spatial arrangement of Cu SAs spontaneously adjusts to a configuration that is conducive to subsequent reactions (Fig.
5g
).
To confirm the contribution of
*
CO adsorption differences to acetate, in situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to monitor the CORR process on different catalysts. The ATR-FTIR spectra of these catalysts exhibit multiple peaks that correspond to various intermediates (Supplementary Fig.
31
and Supplementary Table
13
). Specifically, CuZSM SACL shows two distinct peaks at 2,042 cm
−
1
and 1,914 cm
−
1
, which are attributed to the atop-adsorbed
*
CO (

CO (
*

) on the Cu surface, respectively
31
,
32
,
33
,
34
(Supplementary Fig.

). In comparison, CuZSM SA exhibits the
*
CO
atop
peak in the same potential region, while CuZSM CLNP shows the
*
CO

peak with minor
*
CO
atop
adsorption. The appropriate mixed adsorption configuration of
*
CO
bridge
and
*
CO
atop
can facilitate the formation of multi-carbon products
35
,
36
. The synergistic and efficient C–C coupling of SA–CL arrangement for Cu SAs and Cu CLs in zeolite cavities promote the dimerization reaction and stabilize the
*
CH
2
–CO intermediate, thereby facilitating the production of acetate. In addition, we performed CO adsorption modelling based on the simulation structures (Supplementary Fig.
33
). The calculated CO vibration frequencies for the modelled structures are in good agreement with the experimental in situ ATR-FTIR vibration frequencies.
Underlying stability mechanism research
We used in situ XAS spectra and DFT calculations to further study the origins of stability after recombination of ZSM and Cu SAs and CLs. In situ XANES spectra show that no notable change in chemical valence of Cu can be observed in CuZSM SACL during the CORR process (Supplementary Fig.
34a
). In situ EXAFS spectra further reveal that the Cu–O coordination for SAs is relatively stable during the CORR process, while the Cu–Cu coordination for CLs slightly increases during the CORR and then reverts to its initial state after the CORR (Supplementary Fig.
34b
), indicating that Cu species in CuZSM SACL is stable during the CORR process. Moreover, the wavelet transforms of EXAFS spectra further confirm the stability of CuZSM SACL (Supplementary Fig.
34c
). Furthermore, DFT results indicate that robust Cu–O–Si bonds offer excellent capacity in both anchoring Cu species (−4.16 eV) and adsorbing CO (−2.09 eV) compared with those of Cu–C and Cu–N
4
C, implying that the Cu–O–Si can efficiently stabilize Cu SAs while adsorbing CO during long-term CORR operation (Supplementary Fig.
35
). Meanwhile, Cu SAs are steadily anchored by Cu–O–Si bonds owing to the competitive coupling between Cu–O–Si anchoring and the attraction of Cu CLs (Supplementary Fig.
36
). Figure
5h
indicates that the confined zeolite cavity can effectively inhibit the growth and aggregation of Cu CLs under competitive coupling conditions, in which the Cu CLs can maintain a stable particle size within the cavity after ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations even at high densities after 4 ps. Moreover, the AIMD simulation results imply that the evolution of Cu SAs and Cu CLs in CuZSM SACL (Fig.
5i
) and the coupling with CO–CO (Fig.
5j
) remain stable after 4 ps. However, the model catalysts constructed by loading Cu SAs and Cu CLs on the surface of carbon substrate undergo the rapid aggregation of SAs and CLs after 3–4 ps (Supplementary Fig.
37
). These simulations well illustrate that the presence of robust Cu–O–Si bonds and the confinement effect of zeolite cavities synergistically enable the exceptional stability of CuZSM SACL.
Conclusion
In summary, we have presented a ZSM-confined Cu strategy to create high-performing CuZSM SACL for CORR. Mechanistic and computational investigations collectively reveal that the synergistic and efficient C–C coupling of SA–CL can promote the dimerization reaction and stabilize the
*
CH
2
–CO intermediate, thus enhancing the production of acetate. Moreover, the formation of robust Cu–O–Si bonds within zeolite cavity substantially enhances the stability of Cu SAs, and the confinement effect of zeolite cavity effectively inhibits the growth and aggregation of Cu CLs during the CORR process. Consequently, the CuZSM SACL-based MEA enables an outstanding CO-to-acetate current density (up to 1.8 A cm
−
2
) with a high acetate FE of 71 ± 3%. More importantly, we demonstrate that the Cu-based MEA can stably catalyse CO to acetate under an industrial current density of 1 A cm
−
2
at 2.7 V (FE 61 ± 5%) for over 1,000 h at atmospheric pressure. The remarkable MEA stability of CuZSM SACL at a high current density surpasses that of all cutting-edge CORR catalysts reported hitherto. This milestone sheds light on high-performing Cu catalysts for practical applications in alkaline CORR electrolysers.

After vigorous stirring for 12 h, CuZSM SA was successfully obtained. The obtained products were thoroughly washed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by centrifugation. Subsequently, they were dried in an oven at 60 °C to remove any residual solvents, resulting in the final CuZSM SA product. The dried product was meticulously ground into a fine powder for further use. Subsequently, the porcelain boat-containing CuZSM SA was gradually heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min

Synthesis of Cu NPs-5 nm, Cu NPs-20 nm and Cu NPs-100 nm
In a typical preparation of Cu NPs-5 nm, 13.3 mg Cu(acac)
2
(Sigma-Aldrich), 27 mg ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 ml oleylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 ml oleic acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) were mixed and ultrasonicated for approximately 0.5 h in a sealed vial (30 ml). Then, the vial was transferred into an oil bath and heated at 180 °C for 3 h (ref.
38
). The resulting colloidal products in the vial were collected by centrifugation and then washed with an ethanol/cyclohexane mixture to obtain Cu NPs-5 nm. The preparations of Cu NPs-20 nm and Cu NPs-100 nm were similar to that of Cu NPs-5 nm but without adding oleic acid and ascorbic acid, respectively.
Characterizations
XRD patterns were collected by a SmartLab-SE powder diffractometer operating with Cu Kα radiation (
λ
= 0.15406 nm). TEM was measured on a JEM-1400 TEM at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. SEM-EDS was obtained through a ZEISS Sigma 300 field emission scanning electron microscope. In addition, AC-HAADF-STEM was captured using a JEOL GrandARM300F with double Cs correctors at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. XPS measurements were performed on an ESCALAB 250 XI X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha with Al Kα radiation. The C 1
s
peak at 284.8 eV was used as a calibration standard. XAS spectra were acquired at the TLS 01C1 beamline of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC).
CORR test in flow cell
The CORR test was carried out in a flow cell that consisted of two electrolyte chambers (20 × 5 × 3 mm) and one gas chamber (20 × 5 × 5 mm). A Fumasep FAA-3-PK-130 anion exchange membrane was used as a separator. A catalyst-deposited gas diffusion electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode in 4.0 M KCl solution and a platinum sheet with a thickness of 0.5 mm were utilized as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. To fabricate the working electrode, 4.5 mg catalyst was dispersed in 1 ml of cyclohexane with 20 µl of 5 wt% Nafion solution (Dupont, D-520), and then the solution was sprayed onto the surface of the gas diffusion layer (Sinero, YLS-30T). The working electrode was placed between gas and catholyte chambers to ensure CO diffusion and reaction at the catholyte/catalyst interface. The reference electrodes were inserted in the catholyte chamber and maintained at a specified distance with the working electrode. An electrochemical workstation (CHI660, Chenhua, Shanghai) with a current amplifier was used to perform the CORR test. KOH (1 M) was circulated through the electrolyte chambers under constant flow (20 ml min
−
1
) via a peristaltic pump. CO was supplied into gas chambers by a mass-flow controller at a constant flow rate of 30 ml min
−
1
. The CORR was tested via chronopotentiometry at differing currents for 0.5 h without iR correction. Gas and liquid products were analysed via GC (Techcomp, GC7980) and
1
H NMR (Bruker AVANCE III HD 500 MHz), respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (350 mV overpotential) test was conducted from 1 Hz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV.
Electrode potentials were rescaled to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) reference by
$${E}_{\text{RHE}}={E}_{\text{vs Ag}/\text{AgCl}}+0.059\times \text{pH}+0.21$$
(1)
The FE for the formation of CORR products was computed by the following equation:
$${\mathrm{FE}}={nZF}/Q={nZF}/(I\times t)$$
(2)
The formation rate (

$$R=(Q\times {\mathrm{FE}})/(96485\times Z\times t\times S)$$

CORR test in MEA
To prepare the cathode catalyst ink, 10 mg of catalysts was mixed with 1 ml of ethanol and 20 μl of a Nafion solution, followed by ultrasonic treatment for 1 h. CuZSM SACL was carefully sprayed onto the surface of carbon paper to prepare the cathode electrode with a catalyst loading of 1.5 mg cm
−
2
, and an Ni–Fe/Ni foam was used as the anode electrode
39
. Subsequently, the cathode and anode electrodes were placed with a home-made poly(aryl-co-aryl piperidinium) anion exchange membrane to fabricate a CuZSM SACL-based MEA. Then, the MEA was assembled with two gaskets and two titanium backplates using a torque wrench to fabricate the cathode-dried CORR electrolyser, and KOH solution was fed in the anode only. The effects of catalyst loading, KOH concentration, liquid flow rate and ionomer content on the CORR performance of the CuZSM SACL-based MEA electrolyser under atmospheric pressure conditions were systematically investigated before recording current–voltage (
I
–
V
) curves. The measurement and analysis methods used in this study are in alignment with those utilized in the flow cell set-up.
In situ XAS measurement
In situ XAS measurements (XANES and EXAFS) of Cu K-edge were performed in fluorescence mode at the beamline BL14W1 of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The XAS was measured using a custom-made electrochemical flow cell. A CuZSM SACL-coated carbon paper, an Ag/AgCl electrode (4.0 M KCl) and a platinum wire were utilized as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The electrochemical measurements were performed in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The XAS measurements were conducted at −0.9 V versus RHE, and the XAS spectra were collected at an angle of 45° with respect to the detector and beamline. The acquired XANES and EXAFS data were processed using the Athena programme.
In situ ATR-FTIR measurement
Electrochemical in situ ATR-FTIR was utilized to track the signals of the intermediates using Nicolet Nexus 6700 spectroscopy equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. The set-up included an ECIR-II cell, supplied by Shanghai Linglu Instrument & Equipment, which featured a Pike Veemax III ATR in a three-electrode configuration. To enhance signal intensity, the monocrystalline silicon surface was initially coated with a layer of gold using the chemical plating technique. Subsequently, 20 μl of catalyst ink was dispensed onto the gold-coated surface, serving as the working electrode. A platinum sheet served as the counter electrode, while an Ag/AgCl electrode acted as the reference electrode. Before initiating the test, the electrolyte was purged with CO feeding gas for 30 min and maintained with continuous bubbling throughout the entire measurement process. Before initiating the test, the potential-dependent in situ ATR-FTIR tests were carried out with the linear sweep voltammetry test from −0.3 V to −1.0 V (versus RHE) with a scan rate of 5 mV s

.
ECSA measurement
ECSA was measured by double-layer capacitance in a flow cell. For the double-layer capacitance method, cyclic voltammetry scans were conducted at the potential range from 0.136 V to 0.236 V versus RHE with increasing scan rates of 10 mV s

$${C}_{\text{dl}}=I/v$$

Theoretical calculations
The calculations for this study were conducted by using DFT in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)
40
,
41
. The interactions between ions and electrons were described using the projector-augmented wave method
42
. The valence electrons were considered using a plane wave basis set with an energy cut-off of 520 eV, which ensured accurate total energy calculations. The exchange-correlation energy of the interacting electrons was determined using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functionals within the generalized gradient approximation

$$\Delta G=\Delta {E}_{\mathrm{tot}}+\Delta {E}_{\mathrm{ZPE}}-{T}\Delta {S}$$
(5)
where Δ

is the change in total energy obtained from DFT, and Δ

are the changes in zero-point energy and entropy under standard conditions.
In the computational hydrogen electrode model, at 0 V (versus RHE), the chemical potential of a proton–electron pair,
μ
(H

) +
μ
(e
−
), is equal to half of the chemical potential of the gas-phase hydrogen molecule, 1/2
μ
(H
2
(g)), at 101,325 Pa, at all pH values and at all temperatures. Consequently, the chemical potential of the proton–electron pair can be adjusted as a function of applied potential by the standard relation between chemical and electrical potentials, Δ
μ
= −
eU
. Thus, the total value of
μ
(H

) +
μ
(e
−
) as a function of applied potential at all temperatures and pH values can be expressed as follows:
$${\rm{\mu }}\left({\text{H}}^{+}\right)+{\rm{\mu }}\left({\text{e}}^{-}\right)=\frac{1}{2}{\rm{\mu }}({\text{H}}_{2}(\text{g}))-{eU}$$
(6)
The free energy change for each intermediate step that involves a proton–electron pair transfer will be a function of
U
. Compared with zero applied potential, the free energies of the adsorbates with
n
pairs of electron–proton, referenced to H

O (g), will decrease by
