Abstract
In an effort to obtain the maximum atom efficiency, research on heterogeneous single-atom catalysts has intensified recently. Anchoring organometallic homogeneous catalysts to surfaces creates issues with retaining mononuclearity and activity, while the several techniques developed to prepare atomically dispersed precious metals on oxide supports are usually complex. Here we report a facile one-pot synthesis of inorganometallic mononuclear gold complexes formed in alkaline solutions as robust and versatile single-atom gold catalysts. The complexes remain intact on impregnation onto supports or after drying in air to give a crystalline powder. They can be used to interrogate the nuclearity of the catalytically active gold site for reactions known to be catalysed by oxidized gold species. We show that the [Au
1
–O
x
]– cluster directs the heterogeneous coupling of two methanol molecules to methyl formate and hydrogen with a 100% selectivity below 180 °C. The reaction is industrially important as well as the key step in methanol steam reforming on gold catalysts.

Main
Mononuclear organometallic metal complexes in homogeneous catalysis offer the maximum metal atom efficiency. Despite this obvious attribute, it is typically difficult to anchor the organometallic complex on a support and retain metal mononuclearity after removal of the organic ligands, let alone their catalytic activity, which is critically determined by the ligands attached to the metal centre. Agglomeration to metal nanoclusters and nanoparticles (NPs) is observed after heating and/or reaction at elevated temperatures

. A few techniques have recently emerged to prepare atomically dispersed precious metals, such as Pt, Pd, Au and Ir, on a variety of oxide supports as oxygen-coordinated [M

. These techniques usually require multisteps, carefully prepared support structures and metal loadings that are of the order 0.1–0.5 wt% to avoid agglomeration
1
. Using the ultraviolet-assisted deposition of gold on titania, aimed to prepare anchored [Au
1
–O
x
]–Ti species, it is possible to increase the loading of gold to over 1.0 wt% (ref.
9
). Still, the preparation is multistep and involving a leaching stage to remove gold NPs and nanoclusters. Single-metal atom [Pt
1
–O
x
]– and [Au
1
–O
x
]– species can be used on any support by using alkali ions to ‘sheath’ the metal cation through oxygen linkages
13
,
14
,
15
. This strategy works well for Au catalysts on either reducible or inert supports, although the use of chlorides as gold precursors may be undesirable, and limit the gold loadings to ~0.25 wt% (ref.
14
).
Here we demonstrate a facile and green single-step method to prepare structurally uniform and isolated gold atom species and examine them as potential catalysts for a number of reactions. The method involves mixing Au(OH)
3
and NaOH powders in water at 80 °C to prepare inorganometallic complexes of the type Au
1
–O
x
–Na
z
–(OH)
y
. An atomic ratio of Na:Au = 9:1 is used, and the solution is simply impregnated on a support. This new approach is inspired by a 1938 report of the visual observation of the dissolution of Au(OH)
3
in alkaline solutions, which was understood as a gold sol or hydrous aurate associated with sodium
16
,
17
; but it has not been used to prepare gold catalysts. The complex formed is free of hazardous ligands, phosphides, chlorides and the like. Notably, this complex is the catalyst itself, not just a precursor of it. Indeed, drying the solution to a powder end-point results in an active catalyst for the reactions under study here.
Results and discussion
X-ray pair distribution functions (Fig.
1a
) that correspond to the unsupported Au catalysts that contain Na and K comprise well-defined peaks below
r
≈ 4 Å, which is consistent with the small size of the catalyst species. Peaks are observed at similar distances for both the Na and K analogues, which suggests the presence of the same Au structural configuration, albeit with different relative peak intensities, which reflect the different scattering power of Na and K. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses corroborate these findings (Supplementary Figs.
1
and
2
and Supplementary Table
1
). The O–Na linkages to the Au atom form a stable structure. The powder can be re-dissolved in water and used again. This demonstrates a structurally unique, uniform site that can be loaded on any support. Commercial TiO

species without any observable structural change (Supplementary Figs.

XAS using synchrotron radiation was performed on samples before and after an in situ reaction under liquid N
2
purge protection (~113 K) to avoid the artificial reduction of Au caused by the beam (Supplementary Fig.

)
18
. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results (Fig.

) show that both the supported and unsupported Au
1

share a similar chemical valence and coordination of Au; the Au–Au coordination number is zero, whereas it is 2.3–3.0 for Au–O. No direct Au–Ti interaction was found when TiO
2
was used as the support (Supplementary Table
1
). Thus, the inorganic single gold atom–oxo complex is stable after loading and heat treatment in N
2
to 200 °C. Henceforth, the formula Au
1
–O

is used for the complex. This allows for different values of the number of oxygen and hydroxyl groups to be explored in our theoretical investigation. We later show that the formula Au

is that of the most preferred atomic model of our theoretical simulations.

after drying are shown in Fig.
1d,e
, respectively (additional images in Supplementary Figs.
6
–
9
). For both 0.5 wt% Au and 1.0 wt% Au, a preponderance of single, isolated gold atoms (>90% count frequency) is present. A few pseudo-subnanometre gold clusters with random shapes and no clear facets are also present (Fig.
1e
and Supplementary Figs.
6
and
7
), and these pseudo-subnanometre clusters are composed of several nearby single-atom gold species. Therefore, the new, single-step preparation method can achieve high (>1.0 wt%) loadings of isolated gold atoms. This salient single-atom feature is also corroborated by the EXAFS fitting results (Supplementary Table
1
), which show the absence of the first shell Au–Au coordination within reasonable mathematic errors and signal/noise ratios. A clear contrast comes with the Au/TiO
2
(deposition–precipitation (DP)) sample, in which the metallic gold NPs are the dominant species (Supplementary Fig.
8
and Supplementary Table
1
).
As single gold atom species, [Au

, we examined first the activity of the prepared samples above for the WGS ‘probe’ reaction. Excellent WGS activity and stability were found for the supported Au

samples (Supplementary Figs.
10
–

). The unsupported Au

–O
x
–Na
9
–(OH)
y
powder catalysts also showed WGS activity starting from around 80 °C, as indicated by WGS–temperature-programmed surface reaction (Supplementary Fig.
15
). XPS analyses of the fresh and used catalysts (Supplementary Figs.
16
and
17
) show that the cationic Au centre is converted from Au
iii
to Au
i
during the reaction, with no changes to the Na charge, which indicates the retention of Na–O
x
- linkages. The WGS reaction working catalyst is thus Au
i
, not zerovalent. The question arises as to whether these single gold atom oxo-clusters are active for other gold-catalysed reactions.
The steam reforming of methanol (SRM) is one such reaction, important for the on-demand hydrogen supply for fuel cells
22
. The SRM reaction is catalysed by a variety of supported gold catalysts
23
,
24
, all with a similar apparent activation energy (
E
app
), 110 ± 8 kJ mol
–1
. CO
2
and H
2
are the only products up to 275 °C, that is, methanol decomposition is not part of the reaction pathway on gold. Mechanistically, the reaction was found to take place via the self-coupling of methanol to methyl formate (MF), which is further hydrolysed to formic acid, the latter dehydrogenating to H
2
and CO
2
(ref.
23
). Supplementary Figs.

is equally active per Au atom (the turnover frequency (TOF) is given in Supplementary Fig.

y
/TiO

catalyst is much higher than that of the 4.8 wt% Au/TiO
2
benchmark catalyst made by the standard DP method, due to the much higher number of single gold atom sites in the former catalyst. This site can be retained at 260 °C for SRM (Supplementary Fig.
20
). Similar to the WGS reaction, XPS finds Au
i
and Na–O
x
- linkages to gold in the used SRM catalyst (Supplementary Figs.
21
and
22
). No reduction to zerovalent gold takes place.

The SRM
23
,
24
and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of methanol self-coupling
25
,
26
,
27
both involve the step of self-coupling of methanol to MF; the latter reaction produces the ester as the final product along with H
2
O on various gold catalysts at low temperatures. Besides being important industrially, this reaction is intriguing from a mechanistic point of view if, indeed, it occurs on a single gold atom [Au
1
–O
x
]– species. Surface science studies on O-activated Au(111) and Ag-doped unsupported nanoporous gold
27
,
28
,
29
have demonstrated that oxidized gold species catalyse the ODH of methanol to give MF and water. However, from these reports it is not clear what the molecularity of the active gold species is. Here we conclusively demonstrate it to be one, that is, the single gold atom [Au
1
–O
x
]– species. To eliminate the influence of external oxygen, the endothermic non-ODH reaction was examined. In practice, the production of H
2
in a non-oxidative process is more attractive, as no costly H
2
O separation from the product stream is required.
As shown in Fig.
2a
, the DP-prepared 4.8 wt% Au/TiO
2
marginally catalyses the methanol self-coupling reaction to produce MF from about 130 °C, and it deactivates rapidly due to the formation of gold NPs on the TiO
2
surface at 170 °C. In contrast, the reaction lights off at around 60 °C on the novel 1.0 wt% Au
1
–O
x
–Na
9
–(OH)
y
/TiO
2
, and this catalyst is stable during the entire course of the temperature-programmed reaction up to 170 °C. Cyclic steady-state tests (Fig.
2b
; five cycles with shutdown to room temperature (RT), with the last cycle at 170 °C extending to 15 h in total) demonstrate the excellent stability of Au

with a 100% selectivity, which still holds after halving the space velocity. The carbon balance was 97–100% in all the tests. The reaction rates are shown in Fig.

/TiO
2
, a much higher gold utilization (around 50 times higher) compared to the 4.8 wt% Au/TiO

1

–Na

Similarly to the used gold catalysts for WGS reaction and SRM, Au

catalysts, as found by XPS (Supplementary Fig.
24
). Thus, the Au–O coordination in the working gold catalyst was partially opened, but the gold atom remained cationic. In accordance with this, the EXAFS data show that the coordination number of Au–O changed from ~3.0 in the as-prepared catalyst to ~1.6 in the working catalyst (Supplementary Fig.
25
and Supplementary Table
1
). The partial opening of the fully coordinated single-atom metal–oxygen bonds to activate the catalytic centres has been reported for various reactions before, by us and others
14
,
15
,
30
,
31
,
32
,
33
. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), XPS and XAS analyses further confirmed the absence of variations in the structural and electronic states of sodium and titanium-based components in the Au

before and after the reaction (Supplementary Figs.
3
–
4
,
17
and
26
–
29
and Supplementary Table
1
), pointing out again that these elements are mere stabilizers of the active gold site, [Au
1
–O
x
]–. Thus, it is expected that any oxide, not just titania, would be suitable as a support, and not affect the intrinsic gold-species activity. This was shown in previous work for gold on ceria
5
, iron oxide
19
, titania
9
, zeolites, alumina and mesoporous supports
14
for the WGS reaction. Also, sodium is not unique, as other alkali cations can play the same role to sheath the active site. Here we used the equivalent K-ion stabilized [Au
1
–O
x
]– and the results were identical to those of Na (Supplementary Fig.
25
). These two alkali ion stabilizers give structurally similar Au complexes, with alkali ions as the second shell atoms around the Au atom; the scattering path between Na/K ions and Au is shown in Supplementary Fig.
29
. The
E
app
for all these very different catalyst compositions is the same; that is, that of the active site of gold.
For the Na-ion stabilized unsupported sample, we explored its composition further by various techniques. In addition to confirming a 9:1 atomic ratio of Na and Au by a combination of XPS, inductively coupled plasma, synthesis of the solution, activity tests (Supplementary Fig.
30
) and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
31
), it was possible to estimate the O:OH ratio by XPS (Supplementary Fig.
2
), as there was no oxygen contribution from an oxide support. For the equivalent supported sample, the active surface –OH groups were estimated by CO-temperature programmed reduction (Supplementary Fig.
30
). The formula Au
1
–O

–Na

9
best fits the data. Note that, although the retrieved powder of the unsupported sample was crystalline (Supplementary Fig.
3
), it was not possible to match the diffractograms to any known gold compounds. Hence, the general formula for the cluster, Au
1
–O

, was used, and various atomic models were investigated in our theoretical simulations. No diffraction feature of metallic Au was found by XRD in the used 1.0 wt% Au

(Supplementary Fig.

1
–O

show that single gold atoms remain intact, which indicates the high stability of the [Au

, as shown in Fig.
3
(Supplementary Table

gives the details). In a methanol-saturated He gas stream at RT (Fig.

(i)), gaseous methanol peaks dominate. After a He purge (Fig.
3a
(ii)), peaks at 2,945, 2,922 and 2,815 cm
–1
and a broad band at 1,460–1,470 cm
−1
are all assigned to methoxy species
34
,
35
. On switching to the reaction conditions (Fig.
3a
(iii)), a new peak emerges at 1,609 cm
−1
accompanied by weak peaks at 1,390 and 1,330 cm
−1
, all of which are assigned to adsorbed formate
34
,
36
. Moreover, a new peak appears at 1,460 cm
−1
that is related to the adsorbed formaldehyde species
37
,
38
. The production of MF was detected by the appearance of a peak at 1,690 cm
−1
(refs
35
,
38
), which was verified by a separate direct MF adsorption test on gold-free TiO
2
(Supplementary Fig.

). To ‘capture’ the presence of the adsorbed species, the 1.0 wt% Au

sample was quenched to RT under He flow (Fig.
3a
(iv)). The MF and formaldehyde peaks became more evident and showed a slight intensity increase due to the limited desorption rate of MF from the active site and limited coupling of formaldehyde with the methoxy species at RT. On continuous treatment in pure He at 160 °C (Fig.
3a
(v)), the MF and formaldehyde species were gradually released due to (1) the coupling of methoxy and formaldehyde to form MF and (2) an increased desorption of MF from the catalytic surface. Interestingly, the intensity of the formate peak (1,609 cm

) remains largely unchanged, which indicates that the adsorbed formate is a spectator species. Heating to the highest reaction temperature shown in Fig.

For unsupported Au

y
(Fig.
3b
), a small amount of O
2
in the feed gas was added to produce adsorbed MF at RT on this material with a very low surface area. Heating the sample to 160 °C was thus avoided as it would cause deactivation through gold agglomeration. Helium purging up to 50 minutes did not remove the adsorbed MF at RT, in line with the findings from the supported catalysts (Fig.
3a
(iv)).
The experimental results (which capture the catalytic sites and intermediate/spectator species) complement the theoretical studies aimed to gain a further mechanistic insight into the catalytic activity of the [Au
1
–O
x
]– species toward MF production. To this end, we performed a detailed study of the thermochemistry of relevant steps, using density functional theory (DFT) (details in the
Supplementary Information
), to efficiently screen cluster model candidates, starting from the analogous clusters we previously studied for the WGS reaction
14
. On these clusters, we discovered that methanol dehydrogenation proceeds downhill to form dioxy methylene instead of formaldehyde (Supplementary Fig.
34
). The dehydrogenation of dioxy methylene species into formate (HCOO) is highly exothermic, and thus results in the HCOO spectator, which was detected by in situ DRIFT spectra (Fig.
3
). Recognizing the need for any active site model in its most stable adsorption configuration to retain a cationic charge of the Au centre in the presence of formate spectator species, we designed active site models with DFT, subject to the constraints: (1) the active site—in its most stable structure—must retain a Bader charge on Au of approximately +0.41 e to resemble the working Au
i
catalyst, and (2) on the initiation of the catalytic cycle, the energetically favoured product of methanol/methoxy dehydrogenation must be formaldehyde (that is, CH
2
O coordinated with the Au atom), as opposed to dioxy methylene species (that is, CH
2
O coordinated with an O atom; this structure is the precursor of HCOO). Accordingly, three new cluster models evolved from previously examined spectator-free models (Supplementary Figs.

with the last two being permanently decorated with two HCOO groups, whereas the first is decorated with a single HCOO group (
Supplementary Information
gives details).
We thus reserved the computationally demanding ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the activities of the three new candidate clusters for methanol coupling to MF. Supplementary Fig.
39
shows a potential energy diagram (PED) for the catalytic cycle for all active sites, each decorated with the appropriate number of HCOO groups. We present our results of the minimum-energy path for Au

in Fig.
4
; the results for the other two cluster models are shown in Supplementary Figs.
40
and
41
. Stages 2–4 take the PED strongly downhill, which represents the strongly exothermic formation of the spectator HCOO. Then, the catalytic cycle proceeds with the exothermic adsorption (−0.72 eV) of a second methanol molecule (stage 5) followed by its exothermic dehydrogenation (−0.99 eV) to formaldehyde (stage 6) and the exothermic adsorption (−0.47 eV) of a third methanol molecule (stage 7). As shown in Supplementary Fig.
39
, the formation of MF at this stage is followed by the highly endothermic (2.73 eV) desorption of MF (+ 2H
2
). The actual catalyst obviously manages to overcome this difficult direct desorption of the products to allow the reaction to happen at around RT with an
E
app
of ~95 kJ mol
–1
. We therefore propose an alternative path that involves the adsorption of an additional methanol prior to the desorption process. In this path, an additional methanol (stage 8) adsorbs exothermically (−0.68 eV) prior to the coupling to MF (stages 9 and 10). Following this is a two-step desorption process, in which (MF + 3/2H
2
) are desorbed (moving from stages 10 to 11) with a small thermochemical barrier of 0.40 eV, followed by the desorption (moving from stage 12 to the last stage) of 1/2H
2
(0.83 eV) after the dehydrogenation of the remaining methoxy to formaldehyde. The desorption of 1/2H
2
represents the most difficult step in the reaction network. Its thermochemical barrier (~80 kJ mol
–1
) is in good agreement with the experimentally observed
E
app
barrier (~95 kJ mol
–1
). A common observation for most hydrogen-abstraction steps on our clusters is that they are abstracted more easily from water-like intermediates (formed by successively adding the resultant hydrogen from the prior dehydrogenation steps to –O/-OH groups) than from OH groups, which is reasonable given the relative ease of cleaving the O–H bond in H
2
O than in OH.

instead of 2CH

OH. The desorption of 1/2H
2
to arrive at the last stage from stage 12 is the most endothermic step in the PED. The dashed box encompasses the stages that represent the catalytic cycle. The undecorated cluster is magnified in the left bottom corner. All other structures are cropped to emphasize the adspecies present. The labels of these structures represent the species that decorate the cluster at each stage; the balance hydrogen atoms (relative to appropriate multiples of CH
3
OH) are not mentioned explicitly. Bracketed numbers are a visual aid to guide the order of events that take place on the cluster; they follow the order of stages in the PED. The bar chart depicts the calculated Bader charge on Au for each structure. Each bar represents a single data point. Bars are coloured with the same colours as the labels of the corresponding minimum-energy structures, as well as numbered according to the bracketed numbers of the corresponding structures. Au, Na, C, O and H atoms are represented by yellow, purple, grey, red and white spheres, respectively. The pink, orange, blue and green spheres all represent oxygen atoms, specifically, the oxygen atoms of the first, second, third and fourth CH
3
OH, respectively. All these oxygen atoms are circled with black dashed circles, and the newly added methanol molecules (when applicable) have their oxygen atoms highlighted with a black arrow. As the structures are cropped, the number of dashed circles that surround the coloured oxygen atoms could be less than the total number of carbon species adsorbed. Structures were visualized using Materials Studio 4.1.0, and the PED and the bar chart were plotted using Origin 9.1.0.

The minimum-energy structures in Fig.
4
(and Supplementary Figs.
40
and
41
) show the evolution of the cluster in response to the catalytic cycle. Specifically, the Au environment becomes more open and less coordinated with oxygen, and thus allows Au to bind formaldehyde, compared to the bare undecorated cluster where Au was coordinated with multiple O atoms. The decrease in Au–O coordination is captured by our EXAFS results as discussed above (Supplementary Table
1
). Figure
4
also shows the Bader charge on Au for all the minimum-energy structures. The charge was found to be negative only for structures prior to the desorption steps (with the exception of structures with H
2
COOCH
3
, which is yet to be dehydrogenated to MF), which indicates that desorption is essential for the retrieval of the cationic Au centre. Importantly, Au is cationic prior to the coupling step (structure 2CH
3
O–CH
2
O–HCOO), which further corroborates the role of cationic Au in this chemistry. Additionally, we show in the
Supplementary Information
using charge density difference plots (Supplementary Figs.
42
–
44
) that Na merely serves as a chemically inert support for binding and/or stabilizing the –O and/or –OH groups and the spectator and/or intermediates. Finally, in Supplementary Figs.
45
–
47
we show different structures of the adsorbed methanol at different stages of the reaction network on all three clusters. We also demonstrate in Supplementary Figs.
48
and
49
that the adsorption energy of methanol (and the associated Au Bader charge) is similarly exothermic (similarly cationic) irrespective of the functional used (PW91 versus HSE06) on all three clusters. To offer a preliminary insight into the composition of the experimental active site, we calculated the radial distribution function for all three cluster models and compared them to that obtained experimentally from EXAFS (Supplementary Fig.
50
). The comparison suggests that Au
1
–O
3
–Na
9
(OH)
9
(the energetics of which are shown in Fig.

) makes up a significant portion of the as-synthesized clusters. This interpretation is further supported by the calculations of shifts in XPS binding energies for Au in the Au

(stage 1 in Fig.

In conclusion, we have shown a facile and green single-step route to synthesize sodium ion-stabilized mononuclear gold oxo-complexes Au

in alkaline solutions, which serve as structurally unique, uniform catalytic sites in supported or unsupported form. These unique sites are 100% selective and stable for methanol dehydrogenation through coupling to produce MF and H

clusters under the relevant coverage of spectators and/or reaction intermediates in the methanol self-coupling reaction as candidates for the nature of the active site. These structures offer reasonable energetics for the mechanistic pathway to MF and H
2
through methoxy and formaldehyde coupling. The alkali ions serve as stabilizers of the [Au
1
–O

]– site, with no electronic effect present. The agreement between the in situ DRIFT spectra and calculated vibrational spectra for the reaction intermediates (Supplementary Table
3
) highlights the capabilities of combining in situ characterization methods with electronic structure theory to identify the true nature of the active sites under the reaction conditions.
We have demonstrated how these materials can serve as platforms to explore reactions catalysed by gold at the single-atom limit. In the examples illustrated here, metallic gold structures are unnecessary, which would considerably save valuable precious metal resources. These new insights could guide the synthesis of the most atom-efficient gold and potentially other precious metal catalysts for a variety of industrially important reactions.

catalysts were made by IWI of a solution prepared as detailed below. Gold loadings of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 wt% were prepared by a single-step IWI of the designed amount of the gold solution. To prepare the solution, the proper amount of Au(OH)

sparging and heated to 80 °C. NaOH powder (atomic ratio of Au:Na = 1:9) was added into the slurry at the same temperature. The mixture was refluxed at 80 °C overnight to obtain a transparent solution (colourless at lower concentrations to light yellow at higher concentrations). The Au

catalysts were prepared by IWI of the gold solution at RT in air. The solution was concentrated by heating followed by drying at 200 °C with N

protection, and then the sample was further dried in vacuum overnight at 80 °C.
Catalytic tests
The dynamic temperature-programmed and the steady-state activity tests of the non-oxidative methanol self-coupling were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz microreactor (6 mm outer diameter, 4 mm inner diameter) at atmospheric pressure. CH
3
OH (10 vol%) balanced with He was used as the reactant gas with 20 ml min
–1
flow rate to pass through the catalyst bed, which consisted of 200 mg of catalyst and 400 mg of quartz, with a 5 °C min
–1
ramping rate. For the kinetic study, the conversion of methanol was controlled in the range 10–18 %. As MF has fragments of
m
/
z
= 32, 31, 29 and 28, the same as the cracking pattern of methanol in mass spectrometry,
m
/
z
= 60 was used as the distinct signal of MF.
DFT calculations
AIMD simulations were carried out in two stages, cooking and quenching. Cooking was simulated with the canonical ensemble using a Nosé–Hoover thermostat
11
,
12
, a time step of 1 fs and 2,000 ionic steps for a total duration of 2 ps and at a temperature of 500 K. The quench stage allowed for the decrease of kinetic energy by decreasing the temperature according to the following equation: temperature = beginning temperature + (ending temperature – beginning temperature) × (number of the current step)/(total number of ionic steps). Our beginning temperature was 500 K (to simulate the reaction temperature) and our ending temperature was 300 K (RT). In each step, a microcanonical ensemble was simulated. Similar to the cooking stage, the quench stage employed a time step of 1 fs with 2,000 ionic steps to give a total duration of 2 ps. This theoretical set-up allowed us to sample a vast variety of structures along simulation trajectories that were able to surpass energy barriers between local minima of energy. The configurations that corresponded to energy minima from the quench stage were used as the input for standard DFT energy minimization calculations, and occasionally they equilibrated into more stable structures than the starting configurations fed to the AIMD simulation stages.
