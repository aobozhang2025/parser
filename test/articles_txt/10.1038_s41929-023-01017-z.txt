Abstract
Rational design of efficient hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) electrocatalysts with maximum utilization of platinum-group metal sites is critical to hydrogen fuel cells, but remains a major challenge due to the formidable potential-dependent energy barrier for hydrogen intermediate (H*) desorption on single metal centres. Here we report atomically dispersed iridium–phosphorus (Ir–P) catalytic pairs with strong electronic coupling that integratively facilitate HOR kinetics, in which the reactive hydroxyl species adsorbed on the more oxophilic P site induces an alternative thermodynamic pathway to facilely combine with H* on the adjacent Ir atom, whereas isolated single-atom Ir catalysts are inactive. In H

. However, the commercial deployment of fuel cell technology is currently hindered by the reliance on platinum-group metal (PGM)-based electrocatalysts for both the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)

, limited studies have demonstrated the possibility of replacing Pt/C for HOR in practical fuel cells
9
. Indeed, the rational design and controllable syntheses of efficient HOR electrocatalysts are still impeded by an incomplete understanding of the mechanism, in particular whether adsorbed hydroxyl species (OH*) is a second descriptor, a mere spectator or even an inhibitor blocking active sites in the reaction, due to the structural complexities of the studied materials and probing difficulties

In this study, we present structurally uniform catalytic pairs (CPs) consisting of coupled single iridium and phosphorus atoms with strong electronic interaction decorated on N,P-co-doped graphitic carbon (denoted as Ir

/NPG) as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for HOR in hydrogen fuel cells. The as-developed Ir

and a mass activity of 428.5 mA mg

at an overpotential of 50 mV, whereas the single-atom Ir on N-doped graphitic carbon (Ir
1
/NG) counterpart is completely inert. A series of control experiments in conjunction with spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations unambiguously reveal that the reactive OH* adsorbed on the oxophilic P atomic site is dynamically followed by the preferred formation of H

O with H* bonded to the adjacent Ir atom, which effectively lowers the energy barrier for the H* desorption and thus accelerates both the alkaline and acidic HOR kinetics. The Ir

) and commercial Ir/C (170 m

) (Supplementary Figs.

). As displayed in the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ir
1
/NG and Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, similar (101) carbon diffraction peaks at 44.4° indicate their layered planar structure, while the relatively weaker and broader (002) peak at 26.2° for Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG suggests that additional P doping results in a lower degree of graphitic crystallinity and richer defects of the carbon matrix, which is further confirmed by its broader D and G bands at 1,315 and 1,598 cm
−1
as well as higher D band to G band intensity ratio (
I
D
/
I
G
) in the Raman spectrum (Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.
4
)
14
,
15
,
16
. Moreover, the metallic Ir diffraction peaks are absent in both Ir
1
/NG and Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, suggesting the absence of crystalline metallic Ir particles, which is further verified by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Figs.
5
−
7
). Indeed, Ir sites are atomically anchored and paired with substantially dispersed P atoms in Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG. The distributions of Ir and P species in Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG are discerned by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). Fig.
1c
illustrates that Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG predominantly exhibits dimer-like motifs composed of two different individual atoms as evidenced by their distinguishable contrast, which can be assigned to heavier Ir atoms (the brighter spots are ~0.17 nm in diameter; Supplementary Fig.
8a
) and lighter P atoms (the darker spots are ~0.13 nm in diameter; Supplementary Figs.
8b
and
9
)
17
. In addition, the intensity profiles along the X-Y lines in Fig.
1c
are consistent with the relative intensity of Ir and P atoms predicted by quantitative STEM (QSTEM) simulation and show that the distances of coupled Ir and P atoms are about 0.23 nm, within the effective length of the Ir–P bond, implying their possible coordination interaction (Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
10
). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mappings further corroborate the decoration and homogeneous distribution of Ir, N and P elements throughout the Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG (Fig.
1e
). Meanwhile, as a comparison, it is worth noting that only bright spots corresponding to isolated single Ir atoms are uniformly dispersed across the entire carbon framework in Ir
1
/NG (Fig.
1f
and Supplementary Figs.
11
and
12
), inversely demonstrating the successful synthesis of the Ir

To investigate the elemental states and electronic interaction between Ir and N/P, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterizations on Ir
1
/NG and Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG. The content of Ir in Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG determined from XPS is ~0.11 at.% (1.60 wt%), close to that obtained from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurement (~1.44 wt%) (Supplementary Fig.
13a
and Supplementary Table
1
). Compared with pristine NPG (with 2.8 at.% N and 0.9 at.% P), the higher N (4.7 at.%) and P contents (2.4 at.%) together with negative shifts of the characteristic peaks as well as the emerging Ir–N and Ir–P species in the high-resolution N 1

XPS spectra of Ir

/NPG suggest that Ir and N/P may stabilize each other in the carbon matrix by forming Ir–N–C and Ir–P–C coordination in Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG (Supplementary Fig.
13b,c
and Fig.

)
18
,
19
. Contrarily, the XPS results of Ir
1
/NG (with a similar Ir content, ~0.10 at.%, to Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG) suggest that single Ir atoms are immobilized through only the Ir–N–C in Ir
1
/NG (Supplementary Fig.
14
). As shown in the core level Ir 4

spectra, the binding energies of Ir 4
f
5/2
and 4
f
7/2
for both Ir
1
/NG and Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG are lower than those for IrO
2
but higher than those for Ir/C, indicating partially oxidized Ir atoms in Ir
1
/NG and Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG (Supplementary Fig.
15
). This result is consistent with the Ir L
3
-edge XANES data, in which the integrated white line intensities of Ir
1
/NG and Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG are in-between those of Ir foil (5

) and IrO
2
(5
d

6
s

) (Fig.
1h
and Supplementary Fig.
16
)
20
. In the Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectrum, a dominant peak at
∼
1.62 Å is observed in Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, which is a little longer than the Ir–N peak observed at ~1.54 Å in Ir
1
/NG and can be associated with a mixture of Ir–N and Ir–P scattering paths due to the relatively longer Ir–P bond length (Fig.
1i
)
21
. In addition, the Ir–Ir peak at about 2.52 Å that appears in Ir foil standard is not detected in Ir
1
/NG and Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, confirming the atomic dispersion of Ir. To further discriminate the coordination atoms in Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, 2D EXAFS wavelet transform analysis was conducted (Supplementary Fig.
17
). The only one observed intensity maximum shows up at ~7.8 Å
−1
for Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, markedly distinct from that for Ir foil (~10.2 Å
−1
), indicating that the Ir species exist as mononuclear centres in Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG. Moreover, the corresponding wavenumber (
k
) for peak intensity is slightly higher than that in Ir
1
/NG (~7.0 Å
−1
), also validating the assignment of the scattering contribution from another heavier element (P) as the Ir–P pair besides the Ir–N in Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG. Then, the quantitative structural parameters for the first coordination sphere of Ir in Ir
1
/NG and Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG were extracted by least-squares EXAFS curve-fittings, manifesting three-coordinate Ir centres (Ir
1
–N
3
) with a mean Ir–N bond length of ~2.0 Å for Ir
1
/NG, while an Ir

1i
, Supplementary Figs.
18
and
19
, and Supplementary Table
2
). Notably, the charge density difference and projected density of states (PDOS) analyses of Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG further identify strong orbital interaction for the Ir–P bonding, evidenced by the obvious charge accumulation around Ir and P atoms as well as the large overlap between the energy levels of Ir 5
d

and P 3
p
orbitals (Supplementary Fig.
20
).
HOR performance
The HOR performance of Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG was first evaluated in H
2
-saturated aqueous 0.1 M HClO
4
at a scan rate of 1 mV s
−1
on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) together with Ir
1
/NG and commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) as references. As shown in Fig.
2a
, similar HOR polarization curves with constant diffusion-limited currents are observed for Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG and Pt/C, whereas Ir
1
/NG exhibits negligible HOR activity. Moreover, to circumvent the effect of mass transport limitation and fast reaction kinetics in acid, the intrinsic HOR activity of Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG was further critically quantified in H
2
-saturated aqueous 0.1 M KOH
22
. It can be found that the overpotential at 1 mA cm
−2
and limiting current density of Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, which are nearly the same as those of benchmark Pt/C catalyst, is lower by ~16 mV and much higher than that of commercial Ir/C (20 wt%), respectively, implying a good HOR activity for Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG (Supplementary Fig.
21
). As a single-metal-site catalyst, to underscore the advantage of atomic efficiency for Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, we further recorded the HOR profiles of these catalysts with the same loading amount of metals (Fig.
2b
). Control measurements conducted in Ar-saturated electrolyte confirm that HOR is indeed the only source of anodic current across the whole potential range (Supplementary Fig.
22
). As the HOR is severely controlled by both reaction kinetics and H
2
diffusion, to extract the kinetic current densities, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded at different rotating speeds (Supplementary Fig.
23
)
23
. Then the exchange current density of Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG is determined to be 3.05 mA cm
−2
by fitting the kinetic current densities using the Butler–Volmer equation (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Table
3
), which is not only about three times and one order of magnitude greater than that for Pt/C (1.06 mA cm
−2
) and Ir/C (0.12 mA cm
−2
) with the same PGM loading amount, respectively, but also ranks among the best of the state-of-the-art HOR catalysts that have been reported so far (Supplementary Table
4
). The calculated mass-normalized kinetic current density at an overpotential of 50 mV for Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG is
\(1.71\,{\mathrm{mA}}\,\upmu{\mathrm{g}}_{\mathrm{PGM}}^{-1}\)
, which is ~3 and 48 times larger than that for Pt/C (
\(0.58\,{\mathrm{mA}}\,\upmu{\mathrm{g}}_{\mathrm{PGM}}^{-1}\)
) and Ir/C (
\(0.036\,{\mathrm{mA}}\,\upmu{\mathrm{g}}_{\mathrm{PGM}}^{-1}\)
), respectively (Fig.
2d
). The HOR stability of Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG was examined by an accelerated durability test (ADT) as depicted in Supplementary Fig.
24
. After 1,000, 3,000 and 5,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles, the overpotential at 1 mA cm
−2
increases by only about 0, 4 and 7 mV, respectively, compared to the initial value, evidently outperforming the Pt/C control (Supplementary Fig.
25
). HAADF-STEM measurements of Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG after the ADTs show that the Ir and P species have retained their atomic distributions as Ir
1
–P
1
pairs (Supplementary Fig.
24c,d
). Additionally, CO-stripping experiments and chronoamperometric tests by feeding 1,000 ppm CO into H
2
-saturated electrolytes were conducted to assess the CO resistance of Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG (Supplementary Figs.
26
and
27
). A steep peak resulting from oxidation of adsorbed CO (CO*) appears at 0.85 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) on Ir/C, but not on Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, illustrating the very weak CO adsorption on single Ir atoms, in good agreement with its superior CO-tolerant performance

Identification of active sites and HOR mechanism
To dig out what underlies the outstanding HOR performance on Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, in sharp contrast to Ir
1
/NG, NPG and NG (Supplementary Fig.
28
), a series of chemical poisoning experiments with cyanate ion (CN
−
) and sulfur (S) powder, which selectively quench Ir and P sites, respectively, were performed
25
,
26
. First, separate introduction of CN
−
and S powder significantly suppressed the alkaline and acidic HOR activities of Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, revealing the indispensable role of both Ir and P in the HOR (Supplementary Figs.
29
and
30
, and Fig.
3a
). To further deconvolute the individual contributions of Ir and P sites, control experiments were conducted for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic electrolyte, which is a two-electron transfer reaction involving only one reaction intermediate of H* (Fig.
3b
)
27
. It is interesting to find that the acidic HER performance of Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG is greatly inhibited by CN
−
, but not altered by selectively poisoning P atoms, indicating that Ir atoms independently determine the hydrogen adsorption. All of these results rationally speculate a pH-independent bifunctional mechanism involving two separate intermediates for HOR, rather than being entirely controlled by just the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) as the case in acidic HER.

s
XPS spectrum is found emerging after the HOR and the corresponding differential spectrum can be divided into two contributions from coordinated oxygen and adsorbed hydroxyl, which coincide with the positive shift and increase in intensity at the high-binding-energy side observed in the differential P 2
p
XPS spectrum before and after the HOR (Fig.
3c,d
and Supplementary Fig.
31a,b
). On the other hand, no noticeable changes of both the Ir 4
f
and N 1
s
XPS spectra between the two states are observed, doubly confirming that the hydroxyl species are bonded to the P atoms (Supplementary Figs.
31c,d
and
32
). To determine whether OH* adsorbed on P sites could participate in the electrochemical reaction, a CO stripping test, in which adsorbed OH* species is generally considered as the oxidative reactant, was performed as an explicit probing reaction
28
. Considering the very weak adsorption of CO on single Ir atoms, Ir nanoclusters embedded on N,P-co-doped graphitic carbon (Ir/NPG) with similar Ir–P paired sites at the shell were synthesized (Supplementary Figs.
33
–
38
). The Ir/NPG catalyst exhibits similar electrocatalytic trends but inferior specific and mass HOR activities as compared to Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG because of its less exposed Ir–P CPs (Supplementary Fig.
39
), whereas a sharp CO oxidation peak is observed in the CO stripping curves, attributed to a stronger CO* chemisorption on Ir nanoclusters (Supplementary Fig.
40
). Compared with Ir/C, the CO oxidation peak on Ir/NPG completely disappears when its P sites are quenched by S, suggesting that it is the OH* adsorbed on P sites that oxidatively reacts with CO* during CO stripping (Supplementary Fig.
41
and Fig.
3e,f
). Therefore, it is believed that the HOR also occurs on Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG through dissociative adsorption of H
2
on Ir sites followed by oxidative combination with the reactive OH* adsorbed on the neighbouring P sites regardless of the reaction environment (Supplementary Fig.
42
).
To further elucidate the reaction mechanism of the HOR on Ir
1
–P
1
/NPG, DFT calculations were performed (Fig.
4a,b
and Supplementary Figs.
43
and
44
). The free energy profiles demonstrate that adsorption of both H* on the single Ir atom and OH* on the adjacent P site are thermodynamically favourable with an exothermic reaction energy of −0.84 and −0.27 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, the results of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation further indicate that the dissociation of H
2
on the single Ir atom is also a kinetically spontaneous process (Supplementary Fig.
45
). In consideration of the OH* origin under acidic condition, AIMD simulation combined with an explicit solvation model was performed to precisely describe the dynamic catalyst–water interface. As shown in Fig.
4c
, during the period of 6–8 ps, the P–OH distance obviously decreases from ~3 to 1.65 Å while simultaneously the H–OH distance increases from 1 to 1.5 Å, indicating a rapid dissociation of physically adsorbed H
2
O and formation of OH* on the P site. The kinetically facile H
2
O dissociative adsorption on the P site is actually a proton-coupled electron transfer step since the catalyst surface presents an accumulation of −0.7|e| during this process, according to the Mulliken charge analysis (Fig.
4d
). It is also interesting to note that the adsorption free energy of H* can be decreased by
∼
0.1 eV in the presence of OH* (Supplementary Fig.
46
). More importantly, in the OH*-participated HOR route, the explicit electron transfer step occurs on the oxidative adsorption of OH* rather than the desorption of H*. Indeed, the formation of H
2
O from OH* and H* on adjacent P and Ir atoms is not a potential-determining step, but a thermodynamic process, the free energy change of which varies from 0.1 to 0.8 eV (considering the possible oxidation of P sites at positive potentials during the HOR; Supplementary Fig.
47
) and can easily be overcome under the operative temperature without the additional requirement of applied overpotential
29
. On the other hand, if there is no nearby OH* species, the potential-determining step is transformed into the combination of H* with solution-phase OH

−
) in acid accompanied by charge transfer, involving a high potential-dependent free energy change of 0.53 eV. Overall, the presence of reactive OH* on adjacent P sites can not only optimize the adsorption of H*, but also shift the electrochemical step from potential-determining direct hydrogen oxidation to the facile adsorption of OH*, contributing to the superior HOR kinetics of Ir

Conclusions
We report an efficient HOR electrocatalyst composed of coupled metal and non metal atoms, which act as catalytic pairs for binding different reaction intermediates. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical simulations have identified the critical role of the P atom in the Ir

/NPG greatly promotes the oxidative hydrogen desorption, thus expeditiously driving both the acidic and alkaline HOR. Moreover, we also demonstrate the potential of Ir

Subsequently, 12 ml hydrochloric acid and 3 ml ethanol were added and the formed slurry was milled in a fume hood until all ethanol was evaporated. Then the resultant solid was dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight and ball-milled again for 30 min. Afterwards, the fine powder mixture was subjected to a two-stage pyrolysis in a tubular furnace (Carbolite) under an argon (Ar) atmosphere.

Characterization
Morphological information was collected by field-emission SEM (JEOL JSM-6700F) and TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F). Specific surface area was measured based on a N
2
adsorption–desorption method using a Micromeritics 3Flex analyser (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation) at 77 K. Sub-ångström-resolution HAADF-STEM characterization was performed on a JEM ARM200F STEM/TEM with a probe spherical aberration (
Cs
) corrector working at 200 kV. For the HAADF imaging, a convergence angle of ~23 mrad and a collection angle range of 68–174 mrad were adapted for the incoherent atomic number imaging. Elemental analysis was studied on a microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyser (EX-230 100 m
2
detector). The crystal structure was examined by XRD (Bruker AXS D8 Advance) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with a LYNXEYE detector at 30 kV and 10 mA.
The mass contents of metals were quantified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (PerkinElmer) and ICP-MS (PerkinElmer). Detailed chemical compositions were examined by XPS on an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray beam (1,486.6 eV). During the quasi in situ XPS measurements, catalysts were first treated at OCV or 0.1 V (versus RHE) in a H
2
-saturated electrolyte for 30 min. Then, the samples were transferred from the electrochemical system to the vacuum chamber of the spectrometer using a transfer bin under the protection of the Ar atmosphere in the glovebox. All the procedures were repeated at least three times in parallel to eliminate test errors. All binding energies were calibrated to the C 1
s
peak (284.6 eV) arising from the adventitious carbon-containing species. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy measurements including XANES and EXAFS of Ir L
3
-edge were performed by employing a synchrotron radiation light source at the BL-12B2 beamline of the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JARSI) in SPring 8 (Japan), in which the electron storage ring was operated at 8.0 GeV and ambient conditions. Pt L
3
-edge XAFS was measured in the total X-ray electron yield mode at room temperature using the BL-17C beamline at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC, Hsinchu, Taiwan), in which the electron storage ring was operated at 1.5 GeV with a beam current of 300 mA. Energy calibration was performed with an iridium or platinum foil standard by shifting all spectra to a glitch in the incident intensity. The EXAFS spectra were fitted using the FEFF 6.0 code.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were carried out at ambient temperature and pressure on a CHI 760e potentiostat. Glass cells were utilized in acidic media, while in alkaline media, all cell components were plastic to prevent contaminations such as from Fe leaching. To mitigate impurities from previous experiments, cells and other glassware were thoroughly cleaned by soaking in aqua regia when not in use and rinsed with DI water and the corresponding electrolyte reagent several times prior to use. The 0.1 M HClO
4
and 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solutions were prepared from appropriate 70 wt% double-distilled HClO
4
and KOH pellets with DI water, respectively. In particular, for all HOR and HER tests, the electrolytes were saturated with H
2
or Ar (99.99%), respectively, by purging gas into the aqueous solutions for 30 min, and then maintaining the gas flow throughout the entire electrochemical measurements. Electrocatalyst inks were prepared by dispersing 5 mg of catalyst into a solution containing 25 μl of 5% Nafion 117 solution (as conducting binder) and 975 μl of DI water–isopropanol solution with equal volumes, followed by ultrasonication for 3 h. A three-electrode cell configuration was employed with a working electrode of glassy carbon RDE with 5 mm diameter, a counter electrode of graphite rod and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, the tip of the reference electrode was placed close to the working electrode to minimize solution resistance. Before each experiment, the glassy carbon electrode was polished to mirror shine with 0.05 μm alumina and cycled ~50 times from −0.2 to 1.5 V (versus RHE) at a sweep rate of 300 mV s
−1
in 0.5 M H
2
SO
4
. Then an aliquot with specified volume of the catalyst ink was drop-cast on the glassy carbon electrode and allowed to dry in air. To ensure the accuracy of the RHE, we calibrated the reference electrode in H
2
-saturated 0.1 M HClO
4
and 0.1 M KOH electrolytes periodically before conducting experiments. A reversible HOR/HER was performed using two Pt plates as both the working electrode and counter electrode (cleaned in aqua regia before each use) with H
2
bubble over the working electrode during the period. To operate the calibration, the clean Pt electrode was cycled at a slow sweep rate of 10 mV s
−1
around the expected value for the RHE in each electrolyte to be used for the catalyst testing until the CV curve reached constant. Then the RHE potentials in the two electrolytes were determined from the corresponding open-circuit potentials (for example, Supplementary Fig.
60
). All electrode potentials reported herein were converted to the RHE scale. The overpotential
η
was calculated by
η
= |
E
(versus RHE)|V for both the HOR and HER. Additionally, for all the
I
–
E
curves reported in this study, the solution resistance
R
was measured via iR compensation command by applying the test potential, step amplitude, compensation level and overshoot level as 0 V, 0.05 V, 100% and 2%, respectively, which was subsequently used to correct the solution ohmic loss by

− iR. The reported current densities were either normalized to the geometric area of electrode (mA cm
−2
) or the amount of the metal in the catalyst (
\({\mathrm{mA}}\,{\mathrm{mg}}_{\mathrm{PGM}}^{-1}\)
).
Several fast CV scans (200 mV s
−1
) between −0.09 and 0.4 V (versus RHE, without iR correction) were applied to remove the surface contaminants to achieve an unperturbedly stable performance before each RDE measurement. In cases where we aimed to assess the activity from polarization curves, we performed LSV measurements at a rotating speed of 1,600 r.p.m. and a low scan rate of 1 mV s
−1
to obtain steady polarization curves. All the measurements were repeated three times to ensure reproducibility. As the HOR is dominated by the mass transport of H
2
to the electrode surface due to its limited solubility in electrolyte (<1 mmol l
−1
at room temperature), the limiting current density follows the Levich equation
36
as:
$${j}_{\mathrm{l}}=0.62{{nFD}}^{2/3}{v}^{{\rm{-}}1/6}{c}_{0}{\omega }^{1/2}=B{c}_{0}{\omega }^{1/2}$$
