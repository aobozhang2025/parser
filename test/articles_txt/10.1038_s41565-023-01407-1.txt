Abstract
Heterogeneous single-atom spin catalysts combined with magnetic fields provide a powerful means for accelerating chemical reactions with enhanced metal utilization and reaction efficiency. However, designing these catalysts remains challenging due to the need for a high density of atomically dispersed active sites with a short-range quantum spin exchange interaction and long-range ferromagnetic ordering. Here, we devised a scalable hydrothermal approach involving an operando acidic environment for synthesizing various single-atom spin catalysts with widely tunable substitutional magnetic atoms (M
1
) in a MoS
2
host. Among all the M
1
/MoS
2
species, Ni
1
/MoS
2
adopts a distorted tetragonal structure that prompts both ferromagnetic coupling to nearby S atoms as well as adjacent Ni
1
sites, resulting in global room-temperature ferromagnetism. Such coupling benefits spin-selective charge transfer in oxygen evolution reactions to produce triplet O
2
. Furthermore, a mild magnetic field of ~0.5 T enhances the oxygen evolution reaction magnetocurrent by ~2,880% over Ni
1
/MoS
2
, leading to excellent activity and stability in both seawater and pure water splitting cells. As supported by operando characterizations and theoretical calculations, a great magnetic-field-enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance over Ni
1
/MoS
2
is attributed to a field-induced spin alignment and spin density optimization over S active sites arising from field-regulated S(
p
)–Ni(
d)
hybridization, which in turn optimizes the adsorption energies for radical intermediates to reduce overall reaction barriers.

Main
Worldwide interest in hydrogen production from water electrolysis with renewable electricity has surged in recent years, since a hydrogen-based economy represents one of the best energy alternatives to the increasing concerns over carbon emissions and climate change
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
. However, the bottleneck for efficient hydrogen production via water electrolysis lies in the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the use of scarce precious-metal-based electrocatalysts
4
,
5
,
6
. The sluggish OER kinetics can be attributed to a multiple electron transfer process with the formation of triplet-state molecular oxygen (↑O=O↑) that involves the spin change
7
,
8
. Despite extensive efforts being devoted to it, the design of efficient and robust non-precious-metal OER spin catalysis with an abundance of desired active sites for the optimization of the adsorption/desorption strength of oxygen intermediates is still recognized as a major challenge
9
,
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
. Moreover, OER spin catalysts may also boost reactions by a mild external magnetic field to further increase the overall efficiency for water splitting towards green H
2
production
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
.
Nature has evolved excellent spin catalysis from abundant 3
d
metals for photosynthesis and biochemical processes (for example, bird’s migration)
16
,
17
,
18
, whose reaction kinetics over spin catalysis can be influenced by an external magnetic field through changing the spin multiplicity of the reactants and allowing the switch from spin-forbidden into spin-allowed reaction pathways
16
,
19
. Inspired by this, heterogeneous OER electrocatalysts including ferromagnetic mixed-metal oxides/metals have been developed to boost OER performance under an external magnetic field
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
19
,
20
,
21
,
22
,
23
,
24
. These ferromagnetic OER catalysts often yield a mild enhancement of OER currents under the external magnetic field (typically lower than 200%), attributed to the fact that a magnetic field favours the parallel alignment of oxygen radicals towards the formation of triplet-state molecular oxygen (↑O=O↑)
13
,
19
. In addition, the surface reconstruction of active sites in these materials during the OER reaction makes it challenging to establish the structure–performance relationship
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
20
. To date, a fundamental understanding of the magnetic field enhancement (MFE) to further improve the efficiency of water electrolysis has remained elusive due to the challenge in the identification of well-defined active sites in these systems. Therefore, the rational design of a heterogeneous spin catalyst with atomically precise active sites, enabling a giant MFE with maximized atom and energy efficiencies, is highly desired to create industrially relevant water splitting technologies. To realize this goal, one must tackle multiple challenges including the ability to engineer a high density of well-defined active sites with both short-range quantum spin exchange interaction and long-range room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering, as well as weakly interacting spin centres that can be altered under commonly accessible magnetic fields (for example, permanent magnets).
Rational design and synthesis
To tackle these challenges, we devised a general and scalable method for the synthesis of a series of single-atom spin catalysts (SASCs) consisting of substitutional magnetic atoms embedded in the MoS
2
host. M
1
/MoS
2
SASCs with tunable metal content were synthesized via a well-designed hydrothermal approach by introducing different molecular precursors including metal salts (M
2+
), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and thioacetamide in one step (
Methods
), distinct from the chemical vapour deposition growth of a single-atom-doped MoS
2
monolayer and two-step hydrothermal methods
25
,
26
,
27
,
28
,
29
. Particularly, the decomposition of thioacetamide during the hydrothermal reaction not only provides S sources for the formation of a 2H-phase MoS
2
host but also creates the desired ‘operando acidic environment’ to facilitate the synthesis of atomically dispersed single atoms embedded into the carrier lattice (Fig.
1a
) by suppressing the formation of metallic nanoparticles. The generation of an operando acidic environment during synthesis and its related chemical reactions are further illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
1
(refs.
27
,
28
,
29
). As a result, such a general synthetic protocol allows for the scalable synthesis of various M
1
/MoS
2
SASCs (M
1
= Mn, Fe, Ni, Co) with a widely tunable atomic doping ratio (M
1
/Mo) of up to ~20:100 (Supplementary Table
1
). Generally, a high doping density shortens the averaged spacing between adjacent magnetic dopant sites to promote their magnetic exchange interaction into long-range magnetic order (Fig.
1a
). Atomic dispersion of single magnetic dopants in MoS
2
with different loadings can be confirmed using different characterization techniques including X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (XAFS), X-ray diffraction analysis, Raman spectra and electron microscopy imaging (Fig.
1b–f
, Extended Data Fig.
1a–c
and Supplementary Figs.
2
–

).

We will first present the detailed structural characterization of Ni
1
/MoS
2
SASCs with ferromagnetism in contrast to other paramagnetic M
1
/MoS
2
SASCs. XAFS and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging were used to further elucidate the coordination environment of M atoms in M
1
/MoS
2
(Supplementary Fig.

and Supplementary Table

)
30
. The HAADF-STEM image resolves a characteristic triangular lattice of Ni
1
/MoS
2
consisting of brighter and darker sites (red circles in Fig.
1g
and Supplementary Fig.
8
), which can be assigned to Mo and Ni atomic sites, respectively. A zoomed-in HAADF-STEM image (Fig.
1h
and Extended Data Fig.
1d
) further reveals that a single Ni atom (marked by a red circle) substitutes for a Mo atom (denoted as Ni
Mo
), consistent with the contrast observed in the simulated HAADF-STEM image of a density functional theory (DFT)-optimized Ni
Mo
structure (Fig.
1i
). In addition, the Ni K-edge Fourier-transformed extended XAFS (EXAFS) spectrum of Ni
1
/MoS
2
reveals an absence of any feature associated with the Ni−Ni or Ni−O bond, but a prominent feature peaks at 1.779 Å (refs.
31
,
32
), similar to the features of commercial NiS
2
, which can be associated with the Ni−S bonding (Fig.
1d
). The Ni−S bond length and local coordination number of Ni
Mo
were determined to be 2.27 ± 0.02 Å and 4.3 ± 0.2 via a detailed EXAFS fitting (Supplementary Table
3
). Among all the proposed structures, DFT-relaxed Ni
Mo
consisting of Ni in the replacement of Mo coordinated with the adjacent four S atoms (denoted as NiS
4
) in a non-centrosymmetric octahedral configuration shows the best agreement between the experimental X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and a simulated spectrum (Fig.
1e
, Extended Data Fig.
1e,f
and Supplementary Fig.
9
). Unlike Ni
1
/MoS
2
, other substitutional dopants in M
1
/MoS
2
(M = Mn, Fe and Co) are coordinated with six adjacent S atoms to form the trigonal prismatic MS
6
configuration (Fig.
1b,c
, Supplementary Figs.
10
–
14
and Supplementary Tables
3
and
4
). The distinct coordination environment of the Ni atom in Ni
1
/MoS
2
is also evidenced by the presence of a new feature at 6 eV above the absorption edge energy (
E
0
) in Ni K-edge XANES as compared to M
1
/MoS
2
(M = Mn, Fe and Co; Supplementary Fig.
15
). The individual NiS
4
site in MoS
2
contains four Ni−S bonds, wherein the shortest Ni−S bond length is 2.285 Å, which is further supported by a comparison of the calculated formation energies of various single-metal-doped MoS
2
species (Supplementary Fig.
16
). The in-plane displacement of the Ni dopant breaks the rotation symmetry in the trigonal prismatic configuration (
D
3
h
) to form a single Ni
Mo
site with a non-centrosymmetric distorted tetragonal structure (
C
2
v
), leading to the increasing strength of the crystal field and reduced level degeneracy (Fig.
2f
, Extended Data Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Fig.
17
). Such a local bonding configuration of a Ni
Mo
site yields a valence state of Ni
Mo
(III), as evidenced by the characteristic adsorption edge in soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
18
).

Magnetic property and OER performance
Ni
Mo
(III) with a
C
2
v
symmetry is expected to yield an unpaired 3
d
electron, leading to the formation of a local magnetic moment around the Ni
Mo
site and potentially creating long-range magnetic order in Ni
1
/MoS
2
at an increased doping density. To verify this, we performed both electron spin resonance spectroscopy and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements to probe the magnetism of a Ni
1
/MoS
2
sample with different metal loadings (Fig.
2
). First, Ni
1
/MoS
2
with the lowest Ni content of 0.05 wt% reveals only paramagnetism without long-range magnetic ordering (Fig.
2b
). By contrast, ferromagnetism emerges in Ni
1
/MoS
2
samples with an increased Ni loading of 0.20, 0.38, 0.95, 1.42, 2.41, 3.12 and 4.20 wt%, whose saturated magnetization and coercivity increase monotonically as a function of Ni content (Fig.
2a–c
), similar to transition-metal dichalcogenide materials doped by other metals
33
,
34
,
35
,
36
. We then conducted detailed characterizations of the ferromagnetic properties of one representative Ni
1
/MoS
2
species with a metal loading of 3.12 wt%. Temperature-dependent electron spin resonance spectra of this Ni
1
/MoS
2
acquired from 2 K to 300 K (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Fig.
19
) reveal a feature with a characteristic line shape at a magnetic field of ~335 mT, consistent with the expected absorption behaviour of Ni(III) (Supplementary Fig.
19
)
37
,
38
. In addition, the linewidth of the electron spin resonance signal of Ni
1
/MoS
2
(Extended Data Fig.
2a
), defined as the peak-to-peak distance, decreases as a function of temperature, indicating the emergence of ferromagnetic order
39
,
40
. The ferromagnetism of Ni
1
/MoS
2
is also reflected in the field-dependent magnetization (
M
) measurements (
M
–
H
, where
H
is magnetic field intensity) acquired from 50 to 300 K (Fig.
2e
and Supplementary Fig.
20
), revealing a clear hysteresis loop and a saturation magnetic field of ~5,000 Oe. Unlike Ni
1
/MoS
2
, pure MoS
2
and other M
1
/MoS
2
species (M = Mn, Fe and Co) show paramagnetism at room temperature (Supplementary Figs.
21
and
22
). All these observations confirm that a high doping density of Ni atoms leads to ferromagnetism in Ni
1
/MoS
2
, which may boost its OER performance under an external magnetic field (a
B
field).
We then evaluated the
B
-field-dependent OER performance of ferromagnetic Ni
1
/MoS
2
samples by performing linear scan voltammetry and chronoamperometric response measurements in 1 M KOH. The current density increases from 3.52 to 64.19 mA cm
−2
at 1.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as the
B
field increases from zero to 502 mT (Fig.
3a
), while the overpotential at 20 mA cm
−2
decreases from 465 to 174 mV. The enhanced OER performance can be directly visualized with the more-rigorous oxygen gas bubbling over the Ni
1
/MoS
2
electrode under the
B
field (inset of Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Fig.
23
). At 502 mT, OER current densities can be improved by 5 to 28 times at 1.7 and 1.55 V versus RHE, respectively (Fig.
3b
). The
B
-field-enhanced current density and Tafel slope reach a plateau above 502 mT, consistent with the saturation magnetic field determined from the M–H curve. In addition, the overpotential at 40 mA cm
−2
decreases from 547 to 283 mV, and Tafel slopes also gradually decrease from 75 to 44 mV dec
−1
upon the increase of the
B
field from 0 to 502 mT (Extended Data Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Fig.
24
). A small reduction of overpotential can generate a rapid increase of the OER current density
41
,
42
. The electrochemically active surface area shows a negligible change under the
B
field. All these results indicate that the giant MFE of the OER activity of Ni
1
/MoS
2
results from the ferromagnetic spin alignment under a mild
B
field (Fig.
2e
and Supplementary Figs.
25
and
26
).

Next, we carried out systematic experimental studies to probe the origin of the
B
-field-enhanced OER activity. First, we found that the OER current density after removing the
B
field does not immediately return to its initial value with respect to Ni
1
/MoS
2
under zero field (Extended Data Fig.
3d,f
). The retention ratio of the current density between the
B
field’s off and on states gradually decreases from 92% to 54% at 1.6 V versus RHE, when the applied
B
field increases from 118 to 502 mT (Supplementary Fig.
27
). In addition, the OER activity also undergoes a slow decay and returns to its initial status four hours after switching off the
B
field (Extended Data Fig.
3e
). Such behaviour in the evolution of OER activity between the
B
field on and off states is presumably associated with the rotation of ferromagnetic domains, in accordance with the characteristics of the ferromagnetic alignment and relaxation between the
B
field on and off states. The ferromagnetic domains tend to align with the magnetic field, but such aligned domains usually don't immediately return to the original randomized magnetization state, and the domains retain some of the net magnetization due to the intrinsic spin exchange interactions after switching off the
B
field
43
,
44
,
45
. In addition, we also found that Ni
1
/MoS
2
with a Ni content lower than 0.20 wt% exhibits a negligible MFE of the OER (Extended Data Fig.
3c
), presumably due to the low density of ferromagnetic domains. As-synthesized Mn-, Co- and Fe-doped MoS
2
with paramagnetic behaviour also show an OER performance independent of the
B
field (Supplementary Fig.
28
). Furthermore, the conductivity of both Co
1
/MoS
2
and undoped MoS
2
can be improved upon the application of a
B
field, but their OER current densities remain nearly unchanged, ruling out the role of improved conductivity in the MFE of OER activity (Extended Data Fig.
3b
and Supplementary Fig.
29
). Although the ion transfer rate can be improved under a magnetic field, the intrinsic OER activity of the catalyst is largely determined by its electronic structure of active sites
11
,
19
. Therefore, all these results show that the ferromagnetic spin alignment can be attributed to the
B
-field-enhanced OER activity over Ni
1
/MoS
2
regardless of the orientation of the magnetic field (Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Figs.
29
–
33
).
Mechanistic insights into giant MFE of Ni
1
/MoS
2
We performed DFT calculations to gain an atomic-level understanding of the origin of ferromagnetism in Ni
1
/MoS
2
and its
B
-field enhancement of OER performance. First, spin-polarized DFT calculations reveal the presence of an unpaired Ni 3
d
electron over Ni
Mo
and induced ferromagnetic spin polarization over nearby Mo and S atoms, yielding a net spin of ~1.610 µ
B
for Ni
Mo
and its surrounding S and Mo atoms (defined as the Ni
Mo
–S–Mo region; Fig.
4a
and Supplementary Figs.
34
and
35
). The ferromagnetic ground state of Ni
Mo
–S–Mo arises from the spin exchange interactions of the itinerant electron in the region, which can be described from the Stoner criteria (Supplementary Figs.
36
–
38
and Supplementary Tables
5
and
6
). According to the ratio of Ni/Mo for ferromagnetic Ni
1
/MoS
2
, we further construct a supercell of Ni
2
Mo
14
S
32
to calculate the magnetic ground states of two adjacent Ni
Mo
sites. Among all the possible configurations with different Ni–Ni separation distances (Supplementary Fig.
35
and Supplementary Table
7
), the one with a Ni–Ni distance of ~6.390 Å represents the most stable configuration due to its lowest formation energy. Importantly, our DFT calculations reveal that the ferromagnetic coupling between these two Ni
Mo
sites is favourable by 30.67 meV per Ni atom over the antiferromagnetic coupling (Fig.
4b,c
), consistent with the room temperature ferromagnetism observed in the experiment. The ferromagnetic ground state of Ni
1
/MoS
2
is further reflected in the density of states plot of the Ni
Mo
–S–Mo region, which shows an asymmetric distribution of spin-up and spin-down electron densities near the Fermi level (
E
F
; Fig.
4d
). Specifically, spin-polarized states near
E
F
are mainly from the 3
d
xz
and 3
d
yz
orbitals of the Ni dopant, the 3
p
x
and 3
p
y
orbitals of six nearest-neighbouring S atoms and the
\(4d_{z^2}\)
orbitals of six nearest-neighbouring Mo atoms, as revealed in the projected density of states in Fig.
4d
. The electron localized function plot of Ni
1
/MoS
2
demonstrates that the Ni dopants increase electron delocalization involving a large charge transfer with the surrounding S atoms, as further reflected from the Bader charge analysis (Extended Data Fig.
2e
and Supplementary Table
8
). According to Hund’s rules, the half-filled
p
x
/
p
y
orbitals of S atoms will be occupied by two parallel spin-polarized electrons. To facilitate the transfer of spin-polarized electrons from Ni to S, the direction of spin polarization of S has to be opposite to that of the transferred electrons from Ni. As a result, the direction of the magnetic moment in the vicinal Ni
Mo
–S–Mo region tends to align with the Ni atoms (Supplementary Fig.
39
).

The key question that remains to be addressed lies in mechanistic insights into the remarkable MFE of the OER performance of Ni
1
/MoS
2
. We first used DFT calculations to identify the active site of the individual Ni
Mo
site for OER. To facilitate the discussion, we label three types of S atoms nearest to the individual Ni
Mo
site as S
1
, S
2
and S
3
, which represent an adjacent S atom with a Ni–S bond length of 2.521 Å, an adjacent S atom with a Ni–S bond length of 2.285 Å and a nearby S atom located at the centre of a Mo prism, respectively (Fig.
5a
). The adsorption of *OH over S
1
is energetically favourable by 0.475 eV, 0.715 eV, 1.703 eV and 1.809 eV compared to that over S
2
, S
3
, Ni and the nearest Mo site, respectively. This suggests that the S
1
site is the most favourable active site for the OER, mainly due to the strong electronic interaction between S
1
and the *OH (Fig.
5a
, Supplementary Fig.
40
and Supplementary Table
9
), as evidenced by the large electron difference density, the dominant electron states at
E
F
and the largest localized potential of S
1
among all three types of S atoms (Fig.
5b
and Supplementary Fig.
41
). As a result, more charge transfer to the *OH facilitates the occurrence of the first step of the OER process (Fig.
5b
), which can greatly improve the intrinsic activity of the OER over S atoms.

An increase in the
B
field increases the total magnetic polarization and the density of aligned magnetic moments from neighbouring Ni
Mo
sites. To mimic this picture, we calculated the OER energy profiles over two neighbouring Ni
Mo
sites under two representative magnetic configurations including ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering (Fig.
5d
and Extended Data Fig.
4a
). The ferromagnetic-coupled active site exhibits a lower energy barrier of 0.315 eV in the rate-limiting step of the OER (the process from *OOH to O
2
), compared to the antiferromagnetic-coupled active sites with a higher energy barrier of 0.387 eV (Fig.
5d
). As shown in Fig.
5c
, the near-
E
F
occupied spin density of S
1
of two ferromagnetic-coupled Ni
Mo
sites is significantly reduced, but the empty state above
E
F
increases, as compared to that of antiferromagnetic-coupled counterparts. Therefore, the reduction of the energy barrier in the ferromagnetic configuration can be attributed to the optimization of spin density over S active sites upon spin alignment under a mild magnetic field, which gives rise to the optimal adsorption energy for a radical intermediate with a reduced reaction barrier. Meanwhile, it is also found that the spin density of *OH and *O species exhibits a parallel alignment over S
1
and S
2
sites in the ferromagnetic configuration, but shows an antiparallel spin alignment in the antiferromagnetic configuration (Fig.
5d
, inset). Therefore, the desorption of *OH and *O to form a spin-triplet-state O
2
over ferromagnetic-coupled NiS
4
sites is energetically more favourable by 0.072 eV than that on the antiferromagnetic-coupled sites, leading to a lower energy barrier of O
2
formation. The current OER profile is the one with the lowest barrier as compared with other reaction paths (Supplementary Figs.
42
and
43
and Supplementary Table
10
). In addition, we also considered another OER pathway involving the formation of a bridge-type O–H–O intermediate and evaluated the corresponding OER energy profile (Extended Data Fig.
4a
). The ferromagnetic-coupled configuration shows a superior OER activity with an energy barrier of 0.418 eV in the rate-limiting step of *OOH to O
2
, lower than that of the antiferromagnetic-coupled configuration (0.668 eV). Similarly, two O atoms in the *OOH species show the parallel spin alignment over ferromagnetic-coupled active sites, whereas the antiparallel spin alignment of *OOH over antiferromagnetic-coupled active sites does not favour the *OOH desorption (Extend Data Figs.
4b,c
). The theoretical insights discussed above are further supported by the operando XANES spectroscopic measurements during OER reactions with and without a
B
field (Fig.
5e–g
, Extended Data Fig.
5
and Supplementary Fig.
44
). The rising edge of the S K edge for Ni
1
/MoS
2
shows a higher redshift at 1.8 V versus RHE under 112 mT than under zero magnetic field (Fig.
5e,f
and Supplementary Figs.
45
and
46
), which indicates that the S atom at the basal plane serves as a catalytic site, with the accumulation of more electron density under a magnetic field that facilitates the electron transfer from O*-related species to the active site during the OER. In addition, a pre-edge feature around 2,469.2 eV emerges in the first derivative curve of S K-edge X-ray absorption spectra acquired at 112 mT (Fig.
5g
). This indicates that the electronic hybridization between S 3
p
and Ni 3
d
electron orbitals becomes stronger under a
B
field, consistent with a larger overlap between the calculated projected density of states for Ni and S under the ferromagnetic-coupled configuration as compared to the antiferromagnetic-coupled one (Extended Data Fig.
5
). A strong Ni–S hybridization will modulate the spin density over the S site, whereby the adsorption strength of O*-related intermediate species can be further optimized to facilitate the O
2
formation, consistent with DFT calculations, as discussed above (Fig.
5d
).
MFE for water splitting using Ni
1
/MoS
2
After gaining new insights into the mechanism of the MFE of the OER performance of Ni
1
/MoS
2
, we also tested its technological relevance by evaluating the
B
-field-dependent electrocatalytic performance in both water and seawater splitting cells. Ni
1
/MoS
2
(3.12 wt%) gives an outstanding OER performance under a
B
field for water splitting, much superior to that of commercial IrO
2
(Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Fig.
47
). The current density of Ni
1
/MoS
2
at 502 mT is determined to be ~5.2–11.7 times higher than that under zero
B
field in the potential range of 1.5–1.8 V. Moreover, Ni
1
/MoS
2
at 502 mT also presents a high stability with a minor current density drop from 39.8 to 38.4 mA cm
−2
within 25 h, in contrast to the commercial IrO
2
catalyst with its large current density decrease from 17.8 to 8.7 mA cm
−2
within the same period (Fig.
3d
). In addition, Ni
1
/MoS
2
(3.12 wt%) reveals a remarkably improved OER performance at 502 mT for seawater splitting, much better than that of commercial IrO
2
in terms of current density, in a wide potential range of 1.5–1.8 V (Fig.
3e
and Supplementary Fig.
48
). Seawater splitting is recognized as a more economically vital water splitting technology. However, the catalyst instability due to the presence of a variety of components in seawater, especially chloride ions
46
, poses a great challenge for the practical use of seawater in water splitting technology. The commercial IrO
2
catalyst shows a rapid decay and drops in current density by 19.2 mA cm
−2
within 25 h. By contrast, Ni
1
/MoS
2
demonstrates a negligible decrease in current density by 2.3 mA cm
−2
within the same period, revealing an excellent OER stability in seawater. This is likely due to a high tolerance of Ni
1
/MoS
2
to the Cl adsorption against the catalyst deactivation (Fig.
3f
, Supplementary Figs.
49
and
50
and Supplementary Table
12
), corroborated by our DFT calculations (Supplementary Figs.
51
and
52
). A large cell with an electrode (6 cm × 7 cm) loading Ni
1
/MoS
2
exhibits promising application in water splitting technology (Extended Data Fig.
6
).
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a general and scalable approach for the synthesis of a series of SASCs (M
1
/MoS
2
) with widely tunable loadings. High-loading Ni
1
/MoS
2
also exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism arising from the ferromagnetic coupling between adjacent NiS
4
sites embedded in the MoS
2
lattice, offering a giant MFE of OER activity. In the water splitting cells, Ni
1
/MoS
2
delivers an excellent catalytic performance with a large current density under a magnetic field up to 502 mT, approximately one order of magnitude higher than that without applying a magnetic field, in the range 1.5–1.8 V, outperforming the commercial IrO
2
catalyst. A large
B
-field enhancement of the OER performance of Ni
1
/MoS
2
is attributed to a field-induced spin alignment and the optimization of spin density over S active sites arising from field-regulated Ni–S electronic hybridization, which yields the optimal adsorption/desorption energy for a radical intermediate with a reduced reaction barrier, as corroborated by our operando characterizations and DFT calculations. In addition, the stability of Ni
1
/MoS
2
as an OER catalyst is also superior to that of IrO
2
in a pure water and seawater splitting cell, demonstrating its great potential in practical seawater splitting technology. Our findings reveal that ferromagnetic SASCs provide a powerful magnetoelectric effect to accelerate both water and saline water electrolysis.

(10.0 mmol) were dissolved in 70 ml distilled water. The solution containing precursors was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 ml). Subsequently, it was sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 20 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The resulting product was washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. Under an Ar flow of 100 sccm, the dried product was heated to 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C min

and kept there for 2 hours in a furnace, and then cooled to room temperature. A series of M

(saturated KCl). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100,000 Hz. All the potentials were calibrated against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), where

Electrode fabrication
A piece of copper (Cu) foam was sonicated in acetone, ethanol and distilled water for several minutes, prior to the preparation of the electrode. Some 15 mg MoS
2
-based catalyst was added into a mixture of 0.90 ml ethanol and 100 μl Nafion (Dupont, 5 wt%) with 1 h ultrasonic treatment. Some 100 μl fresh catalyst ink was dropped onto a piece of Cu foam (0.5 cm × 2 cm; the surface area of the catalyst deposited on the electrode is 0.5 cm
2
) and dried at room temperature for 12 h. All tests were performed in 1.0 M KOH solution saturated with oxygen gas (O
2
). For a comparison, 10 mg IrO
2
catalyst was added into a mixture of 0.90 ml ethanol and 100 μl Nafion with 1 h ultrasonic treatment. Some 100 μl of fresh catalyst ink was dropped onto a piece of Cu foam, and the loading of IrO
2
on the Cu foam was 1 mg cm
−2
. The samples were run for ten cycles to reach a steady state. The linear scan voltammetry measurements for the MoS
2
and IrO
2
catalysts were recorded in O
2
-saturated electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV s
−1
. Cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded from 0.37 to 0.57 V versus RHE with a scan rate of 10 mV s
−1
to 120 mV s
−1
to measure the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (
C
dl
). The long-term stability was measured by chronoamperometric response under magnetic stirring. OER performances under different magnetic fields were performed by tuning the distances between the electrode and magnets. Seawater was collected from Sentosa beach (Singapore), and filtrated by filter paper.
The Cu foil loaded with the catalyst (0.2 mg cm
−2
) acted as the work electrode (anode), and the Pt wire was the cathode. Ten neodymium magnets (one magnet, 3 cm × 2 cm × 0.5 cm) were stacked and placed near the anode of the water splitting cell. The magnetic field experienced by the electrode was carefully calibrated using a Gauss meter (TD8620, Shenzhen; Supplementary Fig.
53
). A large water splitting cell was constructed using two 6 cm × 10 cm carbon papers loaded with Ni
1
/MoS
2
(3 mg cm
−2
, 6 cm × 7 cm) and Pt/C (20 wt% Pt, 3 mg cm
−2
, 6 cm × 7 cm) as the anode and cathode, respectively. One hundred neodymium magnets (3 cm × 2 cm × 0.5 cm) were compiled into a large magnet and placed near the anode.

were treated as valence states for Mo, S, Ni, O and H atoms, respectively. According to the experimental Ni loading concentration, the 4 × 4 × 1 supercell of MoS
2
with one Mo atom replaced by a Ni atom was used to simulate the doping effect. A vacuum slab of 16 Å was added to avoid the interlayer interaction. The structures were relaxed with a 2 × 2 × 1 gamma-centred k-point mesh for the supercell, and the electronic self-consistent calculations were performed using the 5 × 5 × 1 k-point mesh. The relaxation was considered to be converged if the Hellmann–Feynman force was less than 0.01 eV Å
–1
, and the energy convergence was set as 10
−7
eV for all calculations with a Gaussian smearing of 0.05 eV. The gas-phase O
2
and H

O were performed in a cubic box with a lattice constant of 15 Å using a single gamma k point. To consider the strong electron correlation effect, a

.
The charge transfer was analysed by the Bader charge with a grid of 384 × 384 × 480 (ref.
56
). The differential electron density was also implemented to analyse the charge transfers during the adsorption process. The differential electron density was attained by the formula
$$\Delta {\rm{\rho }}={\rho }_{{\mathrm{AB}}}-{\rho }_{{\mathrm{A}}}-{\rho }_{{\mathrm{B}}}$$
where
ρ

represents the charge density of the whole system after absorption, and
ρ

and
ρ

represent the charge densities of the adsorbed species and catalyst, respectively.
