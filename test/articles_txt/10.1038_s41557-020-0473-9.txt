Abstract
Single-atom catalysts not only maximize metal atom efficiency, they also display properties that are considerably different to their more conventional nanoparticle equivalents, making them a promising family of materials to investigate. Herein we developed a general host–guest strategy to fabricate various metal single-atom catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon (M
1
/CN, M = Pt, Ir, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni, Mn). The iridium variant Ir
1
/CN electrocatalyses the formic acid oxidation reaction with a mass activity of 12.9
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}\)
whereas an Ir/C nanoparticle catalyst is almost inert (~4.8 × 10
−3
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}\)
). The activity of Ir
1
/CN is also 16 and 19 times greater than those of Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively. Furthermore, Ir
1
/CN displays high tolerance to CO poisoning. First-principle density functional theory reveals that the properties of Ir
1
/CN stem from the spatial isolation of iridium sites and from the modified electronic structure of iridium with respect to a conventional nanoparticle catalyst.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted wide attention in recent years because they maximize metal use and have tailorable, uniform metal active sites

applications that are driven by cost-sensitive noble metal catalysts.
SACs often show different chemistries and reaction pathways to conventional nanoparticle catalysts. The differences stem from the fact that the metal sites in SACs generally carry partially positive charges due to electron transfer between the metals and ligating atoms on the support. The partially positively charged metal sites possess decreased electron density and therefore modified metal–reaction species interactions
13
,
14
,
15
. More importantly, the spatial isolation of the metal atoms in SACs can be further exploited to change the adsorption mode of reactive intermediates and prevent side reactions that require adjacent metal sites to proceed
16
,
17
.
Direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs) are small, lightweight and long-lasting portable power sources that have the potential to compete with current battery technology
18
,
19
,
20
. Developing robust catalysts for the anodic formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is essential for the fabrication of commercially viable DFAFCs. Palladium- and platinum-based nanocrystals are by far the most efficient catalysts for the FAOR
20
,
21
,
22
; however, their low mass activity and vulnerability to CO poisoning diminish their widely commercial applications. Previous efforts in improving FAOR efficiency mainly focused on (1) modifying the electronic structure of palladium/platinum with other elements (for example, gold
22
,
23
, bismuth
24
, copper
25
, nickel
26
and tin
27
), (2) controlling the shape and exposed facets of palladium/platinum nanocrystals
21
,
28
and (3) fabricating hollow/framed/ultrathin high-specific-area palladium/platinum nanostructures
29
,
30
. These strategies effectively enhance the catalytic activity and durability of palladium and platinum. Nevertheless, little progress has been achieved in developing a new catalytic system that is superior to current palladium- and platinum-based materials. Inspired by the fact that metallic iron and cobalt particles are inactive for O
2
reduction, whereas metal single atoms on nitrogen-doped carbon (M
1
/CN) are quite stable and active
4
,
31
, we speculated whether there is a type of M
1
/CN catalyst that can efficiently catalyse the FAOR. M/CN catalysts have been the focus of research for many years
32
,
33
,
34
, but M/CNs with notable properties for the FAOR have not yet been systematically developed.
Herein we utilize a general host–guest strategy to fabricate various metal SACs on nitrogen-doped carbon (M
1
/CN, M = Pt, Ir, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni, Mn) and screened their performances for the FAOR. Among these metal SAC materials, we discovered that Ir
1
/CN exhibited high catalytic activity. For a long time, iridium has been neglected as an electrocatalyst for the FAOR as nanoparticle Ir/C was tested to be almost inert
35
,
36
,
37
. In this work, the activity of Ir
1
/CN (12.9
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}\)
) was three orders of magnitude larger than that of Ir/C (4.8 × 10
−3
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}\)
) and was also superior to those of commercial Pd/C, commercial Pt/C and most other materials reported so far (Supplementary Table
1
). More importantly, Ir
1
/CN exhibited tolerance to CO poisoning during the FAOR, which is distinct from nanoparticle catalysts. The discovery of Ir
1
/CN as a highly efficient FAOR catalyst not only promotes the development of DFAFCs, but also encourages exploration of SAC materials to find useful properties that are not possessed by conventional nanomaterials.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterizations of metal SACs
For the fabrication of metal SACs on nitrogen-doped carbon, we used porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as hosts to in situ-trap metal precursor guests in their cages during MOF crystallization. Thereafter, the metal precursors@MOF composites were pyrolysed at high temperature to anchor metal single atoms onto MOF-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (M
1
/CN; Fig.
1a
). Taking the synthesis of Ir
1
/CN, for example, we chose zeolite imidazolate framework 8 (ZIF-8) as the host and iridium acetylacetonate (Ir(acac)
3
) as the guest molecule due to its diameter (
d
i
= 9.8 Å) being between those of ZIF-8 pores (
d
p
= 3.4 Å) and cavities (
d
c
= 11.6 Å). We mixed a Ir(acac)
3
/Zn(NO
3
)
2
methanol solution with a 2-methylimidazole methanol solution to in situ-encapsulate Ir(acac)
3
within ZIF-8 during ZIF-8 crystallization. Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra of Ir(acac)
3
and Ir(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 showed consistent bands in the 290–325 nm and 415–450 nm ranges, which suggests that Ir(acac)
3
was encapsulated within ZIF-8 (Supplementary Fig.
1
). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments revealed rhombododecahedron-shaped Ir(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 nanocrystals (Supplementary Fig.
2
). The X-ray-diffraction pattern of Ir(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 was well matched with that of ZIF-8 (Supplementary Fig.
3
), indicating that Ir(acac)
3
did not disturb ZIF crystallization.

Ir(acac)
3
@ZIF-8 was then pyrolysed at 900 °C to decompose Ir(acac)
3
(ref.
38
) and carbonize the organic linkers
39
,
40
, leading to iridium single atoms on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ir
1
/CN). During pyrolysis, crystalline porous ZIF-8 acts as a molecular fence and spatially separates the Ir(acac)
3
precursors. The homogenous dispersion of Ir(acac)
3
within ZIF-8 prevented the collision and aggregation of iridium atoms during ZIF pyrolysis. Moreover, the in situ-formed nitrogen-doped carbon provided abundant coordination sites for the stabilization of iridium atoms; no aggregated species were observed by environmental transmission microscopy (ETEM) during high-temperature pyrolysis of up to 1,000 °C. At 1,100 °C, the nitrogen species can be largely eliminated in CN substrates
41
. The loss of nitrogen coordinating sites induces the release of iridium single atoms from the CN support, which aggregate into iridium nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig.
4
). The X-ray diffraction pattern of Ir
1
/CN showed two broad peaks located at 25° and 44° (Supplementary Fig.
3
), which were assigned to the characteristic carbon (002) and (100)/(101) diffractions, respectively, indicating that ZIF-8 was destroyed and converted to CN; graphitic CN is further confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
5
). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen as the dominant nitrogen species on CN after calcination (Supplementary Fig.
6
and Supplementary Table
2
).
The iridium loading of Ir
1
/CN was determined to be 1.2 wt% by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Supplementary Table
3
). The morphology of Ir
1
/CN showed a slightly concaved rhombododecahedron shape and no iridium nanoparticles were observed using a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM; Fig.
1b
). The corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray elemental mapping results demonstrated that iridium, nitrogen and carbon were homogeneously distributed over Ir
1
/CN (Fig.
1c
). From the high-resolution HAADF-STEM images of Ir
1
/CN (Fig.
1d,e
and Supplementary Fig.
7
), iridium single atoms were clearly observed as bright dots labelled with white circles (Fig.
1e
).
Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis further confirmed the atomic dispersion of iridium. A notable peak at about 1.6 Å was observed in the Fourier-transformed EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) curve for Ir
1
/CN (Fig.
1f
), which corresponds to Ir–N scattering paths. An Ir–Ir peak at ~2.6 Å for iridium foil standards was not detected in Ir
1
/CN, verifying the sole existence of iridium single atoms in Ir
1
/CN. Quantitative structural parameters for iridium in Ir
1
/CN, obtained by least-squares FT-EXAFS fitting (Fig.
1f
, Supplementary Fig.
8
and Supplementary Fig.
9
), indicated four-coordinate iridium centres with a mean bond length of about 2 Å (Supplementary Table
4
).
The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) curve of Ir
1
/CN reveals a white line peak between those of iridium powder and IrO
2
(Fig.
1g
). The average oxidation number of iridium species can be described by the integrated area of the white line intensity of the iridium L
3
-edge
42
,
43
. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
10
, the white line area of Ir
1
/CN is between iridium powder and IrO
2
, indicating that the average oxidation number of iridium is between 0 and +4. The fitted oxidation state of iridium in Ir
1
/CN from the XANES spectra is 2.42, which is consistent with XPS measurements. The peak position of Ir
1
/CN (iridium 4
f
) shifted towards a higher binding energy in comparison with Ir/C and is located between those of Ir
0
and Ir
4+
(Supplementary Fig.
11
).
There are various possible structures for a given metal iridium with four coordination atoms, such as Ir–C
x
N
y
(
x
+
y
= 4,
x
= 1 ≈ 4), and an iridium central atom bound to four pyridinic or pyrrolic nitrogen atoms (denoted as Ir–N
4
and Ir–N
4
-5, respectively; Supplementary Fig.
12
). These structures are difficult to discern by experimental characterizations. We conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the coordination environment of iridium and clarify the molecular-level structure of Ir
1
/CN. Supplementary Fig.
13
shows the calculated formation energy with varying nitrogen chemical potentials (
µ
N
) for various structures of iridium SACs. The system with the most negative value is the most energetically favourable structure. In general, if
µ
N
< 0.67 eV, it is found that the graphene support is the most stable and the formation of iridium single atoms is endothermic. If
µ
N
is larger than 0.67 eV, the formation of iridium SACs becomes energetically favoured; the most stable structure is Ir–N
4
, followed by Ir–N
3
C
1
among calculated Ir single atom species. As the energy difference between Ir–N
4
and Ir–N
3
C
1
is at least 1.82 eV, the population of Ir–N
4
structures is almost 100% among these possible structures. We further identified the local structure of Ir
1
/CN by XANES simulations, which had high sensitivity to the three-dimensional atom arrangement. The simulated XANES spectrum based on the structure model (Ir–N
4
) agreed well with the experimental one, as is shown in Supplementary Fig.
14
.
The host–guest strategy can be readily generalized to various 3

catalytically active elements (including but not limited to Pt, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni and Mn). By simply replacing Ir(acac)

with other metal precursors (Pt(acac)

, Cu(acac)

, Ni(acac)

and Mn(acac)

), various metal SACs (M
1
/CN) can be obtained using similar procedures. As shown in Fig.
2
, no observable metal–metal coordination was detected in the FT-EXAFS spectra (Fig.
2
) of the as-prepared M
1
/CN, which confirms the sole presence of atomically dispersed metals in M
1
/CN (see Supplementary Table
5
for quantitative FT-EXAFS fitting). The XANES curves indicate that the metals in M
1
/CN carry a partially positive charge with an oxidation state between those of metal and metal oxide (M
δ
+
, Supplementary Figs.
15
–
22
). The atomically dispersed nature of M
1
/CN was also demonstrated by high-resolution HAADF-STEM (Fig.
2
), which shows uniform atomic dispersion of the metal atoms throughout the CN supports.

Electrocatalytic activity of metal SACs and metal nanocatalysts for the FAOR
Although palladium- and platinum-based catalysts are hitherto the most active materials for the FAOR, Pt
1
/CN and Pd
1
/CN show different electrocatalytic behaviours to their nanoparticle counterparts. As revealed by cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Pt
1
/CN (Fig.
3a
) and Pd
1
/CN (Fig.
3c
), no electrocatalytic FAOR current was detected. The rectangular CV curves of Pt
1
/CN and Pd
1
/CN were attributed to high-background non-Faradaic current of high-surface-area nitrogen-doped carbon
44
. We further examined the CV curves of other M
1
/CN catalysts (Fig.
3
) and discovered that Ir
1
/CN unexpectedly exhibits oxidation current peaks in both the forwards and backwards CV scans (Fig.
3b
), which is distinct from other M
1
/CN materials and their nanoparticle counterparts

,
36

The electrochemical behaviour of Ir
1
/CN is considerably different to its nanoparticle counterpart Ir/C (refer to the Methods for the synthesis of Ir/C, see Supplementary Fig.
23
for TEM images). Unlike the CV curve of Ir/C, which showed oxidation/reduction current at potential ranges below 0.15 V, Ir
1
/CN exhibited no Faradaic current in the corresponding potential range (Fig.
4a
), indicating that iridium lost its metallicity after its size was reduced to the atomic scale. The possible contribution of nitrogen-doped carbon support of Ir
1
/CN for the FAOR was excluded by measuring the activity of ZIF-8-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (CN without iridium) under the same conditions (Supplementary Fig.
24
), indicating that the atomically dispersed iridium species on CN contributed the observed FAOR current of Ir
1
/CN. The background-corrected CV curve of Ir
1
/CN was obtained by subtracting the CV curve of CN from the original CV curve of Ir
1
/CN. As presented in Fig.
4b
, the current density of Ir
1
/CN reached a maximum value of 12.9
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}\)
, whereas Ir/C showed negligible FAOR current, which is consistent with previously reported results for Ir/C (refs.
35
,
37
).

/CN and Ir/C (Fig.

). Surprisingly, the activity of Ir
1
/CN (3.56 to 9.06
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}\)
in the potential range of 0.5 to 0.7 V) was 1,525–2,059-fold greater than Ir/C (2.33 × 10
−3
to 4.81 × 10
−3
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}\)
in the 0.5–0.7 V potential range). Moreover, the activity of Ir
1
/CN also surpassed those of commercial Pd/C, Pt/C and most catalysts reported so far (Supplementary Table
1
). The forwards-scan voltammetric curves demonstrated that the peak current density of Ir
1
/CN (12.9
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}\)
at 0.70 V) was 17- and 19-fold greater than those of Pd/C (0.77
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Pd}}}}}\)
at 0.48 V) and Pt/C (0.69
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Pt}}}}}\)
at 0.97 V) (Fig.
4d
). Notably, even at a lower potential of 0.48 V (the peak potential of Pd/C), the mass activity of Ir
1
/CN (2.97
\({{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}\)
) was 3.8-fold greater than Pd/C and also outperformed most reported catalysts at 0.48 V (Supplementary Table
1
).
The atomic dispersion of iridium is vital to the high activity of Ir
1
/CN in the FAOR. Ir
1
Ir
n
/CN, with mixed single atoms and nanoparticle catalysts (synthesized by pyrolysing Ir(acac)
3
/ZIF-8 at 1,100 °C, Supplementary Fig.
25
), featured an obvious FOAR current, but the peak potential was more positive than that of Ir
1
/CN (Supplementary Fig.
26
). Moreover, the peak current density of Ir
1
Ir
n
/CN decreased by 37% compared with Ir
1
/CN. Ir
1
Ir
n
/CN exhibited Faradaic current at potential ranges below 0.15 V (as indicated by the arrow in Supplementary Fig.
26
), which is a shared feature of iridium nanoparticles/C (Fig.
4a
).
We further found that Ir
1
/CN not only showed high activity, but was also resistant to CO poisoning, which is one of the major factors that deactivated noble-metal FAOR nanocatalysts
45
,
46
. As shown in the chronoamperometric
I
–
t
curves recorded at 0.48 V (Supplementary Fig.
27
), when we injected CO gas into the 0.5 M H
2
SO
4
/0.5 M HCOOH solution from 300 s, the current density of commercial Pd/C and Pt/C rapidly decreased to about zero. After stopping CO injection at 600 s, Pd/C and Pt/C still showed no activity as they were completely poisoned by CO and unable to oxidize the adsorbed CO at a potential as low as 0.48 V (see Supplementary Fig.
28
for CO stripping curves of Pd/C and Pt/C). As previously reported, the FAOR on platinum nanocatalysts took a two-step reaction (HCOOH → CO
ads
+ H
2
O → CO
2
+ 2H
+
+ 2e
−
), which can be poisoned below their CO electro-oxidation potential
44
. When the CO poisoning experiment was performed at the FAOR peak potential (0.97 V) of Pt/C (Supplementary Fig.
27
), CO injection had only a minor influence on the FAOR performance of Pt/C as the surface platinum atoms on Pt/C easily oxidized the adsorbed CO at 0.97 V. For Ir
1
/CN, CO injection only caused a slight decrease in current density, whether at a low potential of 0.48 V or at the peak potential of the FAOR (0.70 V; Supplementary Fig.
27
). The current density of Ir
1
/CN quickly recovered to a steady state after stopping CO injection. This high resistance to CO poisoning during CO injection has not been achieved by nanoparticle catalysts.
Moreover, Ir
1
/CN was quite stable in long-term catalysis. Ir
1
/CN retains 92.2% of its initial mass activity (Fig.
5a,d
) after a 10 h chronoamperometric
I
–
t
test. By contrast, commercial Pt/C and Pd/C retained only 76.6% and 38.5% of its initial current density, respectively (Fig.
5b–d
). The FT-EXAFS spectra (Fig.
5e
) and high-resolution HAADF-STEM images (Fig.
5f
) of Ir
1
/CN after the durability test confirmed that the iridium single atoms were retained on the support and that no iridium nanoparticles were formed.

Mechanism study of Ir
1
/CN and nanoparticle Ir/C for the FAOR
Potential-dependent in situ XAFS measurements of iridium were performed to track the electronic structure evolution and probe the catalytic behaviour of Ir
1
/CN under operating conditions. The in situ XANES spectra of Ir
1
/CN recorded at various potentials are illustrated in Fig.

3
-edge XANES white line area (Supplementary Fig.
29
, Supplementary Fig.

and Supplementary Table

) suggested that the average oxidation number of iridium evolved from 4.81 (0 V), to 2.36 (0.38 V), to 0.33 (0.64 V), to 1.68 (0.99 V) under operating conditions. The average oxidation number manifested an obvious potential-depended change. From 0 V to 0.64 V, the average oxidation number shifted a to lower value. At 0.99 V, it shifted to higher value, indicating the increase in the iridium oxidation state. We draw the average oxidation number of iridium and the current density of Ir
1
/CN versus applied potential in one plot and found it exhibited a trend where the average oxidation number of iridium decreased with the increase of current density (Fig.
6b
). The associated change of iridium oxidation state with the current density indicated that the atomically dispersed iridium species are the reactive centres, whose 5
d
band occupancy became higher as a result of electron transfer from formic acid to iridium during the FAOR.

The electron transfer of formic acid to the anode generally follows two distinct pathways: one is the direct pathway by which HCOOH undergoes a sequential dehydrogenation step to the final production of CO
2
; the other one is the indirect pathway in which HCOOH dehydrates to form CO
ads
as a reaction intermediate, which is then oxidized to CO
2
. The direct pathway is much more favourable than the indirect pathway as CO
ads
could poison and deactivate metal nanocatalysts

We performed DFT calculations to investigate the FAOR reaction pathways of the Ir
1
/CN catalyst and its nanoparticle counterpart Ir/C. We constructed a spherical nanocluster model with 166 iridium atoms to simulate iridium nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig.
31
). The size of this model is consistent with experimental values (Supplementary Fig.
32
). For Ir/C, calculations show that the indirect pathway the most favoured path due to the stronger binding of CO* on the Ir/C surface than COOH* and HCOO* (Fig.
6c
, Supplementary Fig.
33
and Supplementary Table
7
). The presence of Ir–Ir bonds facilitates the formation of CO* and OH* via dehydration of HCOOH on adjacent iridium sites. However, the as-formed vicinal CO* and OH* required an energy input as high as 1.14 eV to be converted to CO
2
. As shown in the electrochemical CO stripping voltammetry curve (Supplementary Fig.
34
), the CO stripping potential of Ir/C was measured to be as high as 1.05 V. Moreover, although Ir/C can oxidize CO at high potentials, the as-formed CO
2
would adsorb onto Ir/C (Ir/C–CO
2
, –0.71 eV), resulting in an endothermic process for CO
2
desorption. The poisoning of Ir/C by CO* and the block of iridium sites by CO
2
collectively led to an ultralow activity for Ir/C.
For Ir
1
/CN (with an Ir–N
4
active centre), electronic structures analyses indicated that the Bader charge of Ir
δ
+
in Ir–N
4
(Ir
1
/CN) (+1.45|e|) was more positive than that of the Ir
0
atoms in Ir/C (+0.20|e|) following adsorption of CO. The
d
-orbital vacancy was therefore larger for Ir–N
4
than for Ir
0
, leading to smaller back-donation interaction and weaker bonding of Ir–N
4
and CO. At the onset potential, the activation of the C–H bond (HCOOH* → COOH* + e
−
+ H
+
, −0.74 eV) became more favourable than the formation of CO* (HCOOH* → CO* + H
2
O, –0.62 eV) and formate intermediates (HCOOH* → HCOO* + e
−
+ H
+
, 0.09 eV; Fig.
6d
, Supplementary Fig.
35
). The O–H bond of the generated COOH* would easily undergo activation to form CO
2
on the Ir–N
4
centre (COOH* → CO
2
+ e
−
+ H
+
, –0.56 eV). All electron-transfer elementary steps were exothermic, suggesting a highly reactive FAOR process through a direct pathway without the formation of poisonous CO (Supplementary Table
8
). The CO stripping curve showed the Ir
1
/CN was unable to electro-oxidize CO, indicating that it is impossible for Ir
1
/CN to take an indirect, two-step (HCOOH → CO → CO
2
) pathway in the FAOR. We also calculated the Gibbs free energies diagram for the FAOR on other Ir–C
x

y
(Supplementary Fig.
36
). The estimated overpotentials are 1.01 V (COOH mechanism) for C

, 0.54 V (HCOO mechanism) for C

-2, 0.81 V (HCOO mechanism) for C
3
N
1
and 0.30 V (HCOO mechanism) for C
4
, which are all larger than that of N
4
(0.18 V, COOH mechanism). These results indicate that Ir–N
4
is the active site that contributed to the observed FAOR performance.
We introduced CO molecules into our Ir–N
4
theoretical model to solve why Ir
1
/CN exhibited such high tolerance to CO poisoning. It was shown that CO could replace HCOOH on Ir–N
4
due to its relatively stronger affinity to the Ir–N
4
centre (Ir–N
4
–CO, –1.15 eV versus Ir–N
4
–HCOOH, –0.32 eV), leading to slight current density decay under CO injection (Supplementary Fig.
37
). However, the as-formed Ir–N
4
–CO would adopt axial adsorption with one more HCOOH across the Ir–N
4
plane (HCOOH–Ir–N
4
–CO, −1.23 eV), rather than coadsorption of two CO molecules (CO–Ir–N
4
–CO, –0.90 eV). With limited interference to HCOOH adsorption on the iridium centre, CO injection only caused a limited decay in activity to Ir
1
/CN, rather than complete deactivation, as with palladium and platinum.
Structural analysis and mechanism studies show that Ir–N
4
is the FAOR active centre of Ir
1
/CN. However, this is not a sufficient condition for showing that iridium-based materials exhibit FAOR activity. We synthesized a metalloporphrin compound featuring an Ir–N
4
centre (chloro(5,10,15,20-tetratolylporphyrinato) carbonyl iridium(
iii
), or Ir(ttp)Cl(CO); Supplementary Fig.
38
) according to the literature
48
, and tested its FAOR performance and CO poisoning capability. The result indicated that although it possessed a similar Ir–N
4
centre, Ir(ttp)Cl(CO) only featured several pairs of redox peaks and did not exhibit FAOR current (Supplementary Fig.
39
). For the chronoamperometric
I
–
t
test, the current density of Ir(ttp)COCl was five orders of magnitude smaller than that of Ir
1
/CN, confirming the inactive nature of Ir(ttp)COCl for the FAOR (Supplementary Fig.
40
). The embedding of Ir–N
4
within the CN support and high electronic conductivity of CN could therefore also be important factors that contribute to the excellent FAOR performance of Ir
1
/CN.
Conclusions
The properties of Ir
1
/CN show that downsizing metal nanoparticles to single atoms can bring about excellent catalytic properties that are not possessed by conventional nanomaterials: the commonly regarded inert iridium metal became active for the FAOR after dispersing iridium to the atomic state. We believe that the discovery of a robust Ir
1
/CN catalyst will promote the development of DFAFCs and support the practice of discovering useful catalytic properties of metal SACs.

Preparation of iridium nanoparticles on Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (Ir/C)
Iridium nanoparticles were synthesized by a modified literature procedure

3
(0.06 mmol, 17.9 mg) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (
M
W
, 29,000, 100 mg) in ethylene glycol (15 ml) was stirred for 1 h and then transferred into a 25 ml Telfon-lined stainless-steel autoclave followed by heating at 200 °C for 2.4 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the iridium nanoparticles were obtained after washing and centrifuging with acetone and ethanol three times. The iridium nanoparticles and 100 mg carbon black (Vulcan XC-72) were dispersed in 15 ml ethanol with overnight stirring. The product was separated and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. After that, the as-obtained product was placed in a tube furnace and then heated in air at 180 °C for 0.5 h to remove surfactant (polyvinylpyrrolidone) of Ir/C (ref.
50
,
51
). The iridium weight percent of Ir/C was determined to be 5.6 wt% by ICP-AES measurement.
Characterization
The crystalline structure and phase purity were determined using a Rigaku RU-200b X-ray powder diffractometer with CuKa radiation (
λ
= 1.5418 Å). Diffuse reflectance spectra were collected using an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (U-3900). The metal concentrations of the M
1
/CNs were measured by ICP-AES. The sizes and morphologies of the catalysts were observed on a Hitachi H-800 TEM. The high-resolution HAADF-STEM characterization was performed using a probe aberration-corrected microscope (JEOL JEM-ARM200F) equipped with cold emitter operating at 300 kV. The attainable spatial resolution of this microscope is 78 pm. XPS experiments were performed on a ULVAC PHI Quantera microprobe. Binding energies were calibrated by setting the measured binding energy of carbon 1
s
to 284.8 eV. The in situ environmental microscopic study was performed on a Titan ETEM microscope (FEI) operating at 300 kV. The sampling nanoparticles are diluted in ethanol and dispersed with ultrasonic waves. The solution was then cast onto a MEMS in situ heating chip, blow dried with dry air and mounted on a functional TEM holder (DENSsolutions, wildfire). Both the chip and the sample holder were plasma cleaned by 30 min to avoid cross-pollution. After casting, the chip and the holder were again cleaned by ultraviolet radiation for 5 min under 35 mbar vacuum to remove the residual organics. The gaseous environment was created inside the ETEM column with pure argon (99.9995%) and heated by the MEMS heater integrated with the chip. Raman measurements were performed on a Horiba HR-800 spectrometer.
Ex-situ XAFS measurements
The X-ray absorption fine structure spectra data (Pt L
3
-edge, Ir L
3
-edge, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni and Mn K-edges) were collected at station 1W1B in the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (operating at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA) and station BL14W1 in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (operating at 3.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA). The XAFS data of the M
1
/CN samples were collected at room temperature in the fluorescence excitation mode using a Lytle detector and all of the references (metal powder, foils and oxide bulks) were recorded in the transmission mode using an ionization chamber. All of the samples were pelletized as disks 13 mm in diameter with 1 mm thicknesses, using graphite powder as a binder.
In situ XAFS measurements
A home-made electrochemical cell was used for in situ XAFS measurements. Electrochemical measurements were conducted on a computer-controlled electrochemical analyser. Catalyst-modified carbon paper was used as the working electrode, a graphite rod electrode was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode was used (SCE, Hg/Hg
2
Cl

) as the reference electrode.
XAFS analysis and results
We processed the acquired EXAFS data according to the standard procedures by using the ATHENA module of the IFEFFIT v.1.2.11 software packages
52
. We obtained the EXAFS spectra through post-edge background subtraction from the overall absorption and normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step;
χ
(
k
) data were then Fourier transformed to real (R) space by using Hanning windows (d
k
= 1.0 Å

) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells.
R
represents the radial distribution function. Least-squares curve-parameter fitting was carried out using the ARTEMIS module of the IFEFFIT software packages to obtain the quantitative structural parameters around central atoms

The following EXAFS equation was used:

The iridium L

-edge theoretical XANES simulations were carried out with the FDMNES code in the framework of real-space full multiple-scattering scheme using the muffin-tin approximation for the potential. The energy dependent exchange-correlation potential was calculated with the real Hedin–Lundqvist scheme and then the spectra were convoluted using a Lorentzian function with an energy-dependent width to account for broadening due to the core-hole width and the final state width

Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode system controlled by a CHI 660 electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua) and a potentiostat (V3, Princeton Applied Research). A glassy carbon electrode (5 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode, a graphite rod electrode was used as the counter electrode, and a double salt bridge SCE (Hg/Hg
2
Cl
2
) was used as the reference electrode. KNO
3
solution (3 M) filled the second salt bridge to prevent the KCl of the first salt bridge from directly penetrating into the electrochemical test solution. The SCE was calibrated with the RHE. The calibration was taken in the hydrogen-saturated electrolyte with a platinum wire as the working electrode. Positive and negative linear-sweep voltammetry scans were measured at scan rates of 10 mV s
−1
, and the average of the two potentials (where the current crossed zero) was regarded as the potential of the calibration value.

solution for 10 min while maintaining the working electrode at 0.03 V versus the RHE; N

DFT calculations
Computational details
All of the calculations were performed by periodic DFT with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package
55
,
56
. The projector augmented-wave method was used to describe the interaction between the atomic cores and electrons with a kinetic cutoff of 400 eV (ref.
57
). We applied the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange and correlation functional
58
. To modularize the Ir
1
/CN electrocatalyst, a Ir
1
N

site was embedded into a periodic 6 × 6 graphene support with lattice parameters
a
=
b
= 14.76 Å and
γ
= 120°. The
k
-space integration was sampled using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid. The convergence criteria for energy and force were set to 10
−5
eV and 0.02 eV Å
–1
, respectively. A sphere nanocluster with a radius of ~7 Å (166 iridium atoms) was built to model the iridium nanoparticles and allow comparison of the electrocatalytic reactivity between a single dispersed iridium site and iridium nanoparticles. The adsorption energy was calculated according to the following equation:
E

, where
E

Gibbs free energy profile in FAOR
First, following the methodology developed by Norskov et al. at standard conditions (
U
= 0, pH = 0,
p
= 1 bar,
T
= 298 K), ∆
G
of *AH → A + H
+
+ e
−
equals ∆
G
of *AH → A + 1/2H
2
; ∆
G
can therefore be calculated by the following formula:
$$\Delta G({{U}},{\mathrm{pH}},{{p}} = 1{\mathrm{bar}},{{T}} = 298\,{\mathrm{K}}) = \Delta G_0({{U}} = 0,{\mathrm{pH}} = 0,{{p}} = 1{\mathrm{bar}},{{T}} = 298\,{\mathrm{K}}) + \Delta G_{{\mathrm{pH}}} + \Delta G_{{U}}$$
where ∆
G
pH
is the correction of pH different from 0, which can be calculated by ∆
G
pH
=
k
B
T
ln(10) × (pH), and ∆
G
U
is the correction of a bias on all states involving an electron in the electrode. ∆
G
U
can be obtained by ∆
G
U
= –e
U
, where
U
is the electrode potential relative to the standard hydrogen electrode.
In addition, we can calculate the ∆
G
0
(
U
= 0, pH = 0,
p
= 1 bar,
T
= 298 K) using the following formula:
$$\Delta G = \Delta H-{{T}}\Delta {{S}} = \Delta E + \Delta E_{{\mathrm{ZPE}}} + \Delta \Delta H_{(0 \to 298{\mathrm{K}})}-{{T}}\Delta {{S}}$$
where ∆
H
is the reaction enthalpy of an elementary step in FAOR, which approximately equals the DFT total energy (∆
E
) after zero-point energy correction (Δ
E
ZPE
);
T
∆S is the change in entropy contribution to the Gibbs free energy. For adsorbed species, ∆
H
at 0 K, 0 bar is a good approximation to ∆
G
, as the
S
contributions are small. However, for gaseous or liquid molecules such as formic acid, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water, we must consider the large entropy term at elevated temperatures.
