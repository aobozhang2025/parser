Abstract
In heterogeneous catalysis, the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons often exhibit a negative pressure dependence on hydrogen due to the competitive chemisorption of hydrocarbons and hydrogen. However, some catalysts show a positive pressure dependence for propane dehydrogenation, an important reaction for propylene production. Here we show that the positive activity dependence on H
2
partial pressure of gallium oxide-based catalysts arises from metastable hydride mediation. Through in situ spectroscopic, kinetic and computational analyses, we demonstrate that under reaction conditions with H
2
co-feeding, the dissociative adsorption of H
2
on a partially reduced gallium oxide surface produces H atoms chemically bonded to coordinatively unsaturated Ga atoms. These metastable gallium hydride species promote C–H bond activation while inhibiting deep dehydrogenation. We found that the surface coverage of gallium hydride determines the catalytic performance. Accordingly, benefiting from proper H

co-feeding, the alumina-supported, trace additive-modified gallium oxide catalyst GaO

, resulting in fundamental changes in the coordination structure of the active site. Even if the type and number of coordination atoms remain the same, adsorbates interacting with the active site during reaction can cause local changes in geometry and electronic structure, as well as differences in the binding state of intermediates
8
,
9
. Thus, it is expected that adsorbates can be exploited to modulate the catalytic microenvironment and reaction mechanism to provide an energetically favourable pathway for product generation. However, the introduction of additional adsorbates into the reaction system often leads to reduced accessibility to the active site for the reactants due to competitive adsorption or even poisoning of the active site caused by unexpectedly strong adsorption

-based catalysts. Several studies by Bell and co-workers have shown that H
2
co-feeding has a positive effect on activity during alkane dehydrogenation over Pt-based catalysts
23
,
24
,
25
. This effect, caused by increased H coverage on Pt-based catalysts, is achieved by promoting propylene desorption while inhibiting deep dehydrogenation
26
,
27
, leading to higher propylene selectivity and a lower coverage of coke precursor
28
,
29
. H atoms adsorbed on Pt change neither the nature of the active site nor the reaction pathway. Previously, in a study of the synergistic effect of Pt and GaO
x
on PDH, we observed that the formation of gallium hydride in the presence of H
2
benefits PDH. This underscores the need for a comprehensive study of the nature and role of the gallium hydride formed in situ during catalysis
15
.
Here we describe a metastable hydride-mediated catalysis in which, under reaction conditions with H
2
co-feeding, H atoms chemisorbed on coordinatively unsaturated Ga sites enhance their capability for C–H activation while inhibiting coke formation during PDH. Combining in situ spectroscopic, kinetic and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that H
2
can induce the partial reduction of gallium oxide supported on alumina at high temperatures, accompanied by reversible and homolytic dissociative adsorption of H
2
on the defective surface, leading to H atoms chemisorbed on the coordinatively unsaturated Ga atoms adjacent to O vacancies. During PDH with H
2
co-feeding, the resulting metastable gallium hydride promotes C–H bond activation in propane by enhancing C–Ga bonding while inhibiting deep dehydrogenation. The partial pressure of H
2
in the reaction system determines the coverage of gallium hydride on the catalyst surface and thus the catalytic performance. Therefore, both propane conversion and propylene selectivity can be improved by proper H
2
co-feeding due to improved reaction kinetics, in contrast to other metal oxide catalysts based on CrO

. As shown in Fig.

, the fresh catalyst without H

co-feeding exhibited both a relatively low initial (after 5 min reaction) rate of propylene formation of 26 mmol per g catalyst per h (26 mmol g

) and a propylene selectivity of 80%. On pre-reduction, the initial rate of propylene formation improved slightly to 29 mmol g

with the propylene selectivity increasing to 86%. Notably, H

co-feeding significantly affected the activity and selectivity of the pre-reduced catalyst during PDH. The initial rate of propylene formation first increased significantly and then decreased slightly as the inlet ratio of H

H

was increased, reaching the maximum (53 mmol g

and H

, the initial rate of propylene formation increased despite a slight decrease in selectivity (Extended Data Fig.

), verifying the positive effect of increasing H

partial pressure on the dehydrogenation activity of GaO

. To demonstrate the industrial relevance of this strategy, keeping a constant high inlet C

H

was highly consistent with that at a low inlet C

(

). In addition, the positive effect of H

∼

in the 1st cycle to
∼

in the 56th cycle (Supplementary Fig.

).
H
2
co-feeding could alter the intrinsic dehydrogenation activity of GaO
x
/Al
2
O
3
. In temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) experiments, the fresh catalyst showed a higher onset temperature for PDH (400 °C) than the pre-reduced catalyst (Extended Data Fig.
2a
). The onset temperature for PDH for the pre-reduced catalyst was 375 °C, and this dropped further to 325 °C for the pre-reduced catalyst with H
2
co-feeding, indicating an improvement in the ability of the catalyst to activate the C–H bond in propane (Fig.
1c
). Moreover, we investigated the influence of H
2
co-feeding on the apparent activation energy (
E
a
) of PDH. The value of
E
a
decreased from
∼
140 to
∼
120 kJ mol
−1
on pre-reduction, and decreased still further to
∼
79 kJ mol
−1
for the pre-reduced catalyst on increasing the inlet ratio of H
2
/C
3
H
8
from 0 to 2.0 (Fig.
1d
). The strong dependence of
E
a
on the concentration of H
2
in the reaction system implies a change in the reaction mechanism caused by H
2
co-feeding. Interestingly, the value of
E
a
calculated from the increase in the rate of propylene formation due to H
2
co-feeding was as low as 44 ± 3 kJ mol
−1
and independent of H
2
concentration (Extended Data Fig.
2b
). This strongly suggests the existence of a new type of efficient PDH site induced by H
2
on the catalyst surface under the reaction conditions with H
2
co-feeding. To explore the potential of the H
2
-promoting effect for application in further reactions, we also examined the C–H activation of methane, which is the simplest probe molecule for establishing trends in C–H activation. The onset temperature in the TPSR of CH
4
was
∼
575 °C, significantly higher than that of CH
4
with D
2
co-feeding (
∼
350 °C; Extended Data Fig.
2c,d
), which suggests that H
2
co-feeding has a facilitating effect on reactions involving C–H bond activation on gallium oxide catalysts.
H
2
-induced changes in surface structure
To clarify the role of H
2
, we investigated the structural transformation of the catalyst induced by H
2
(Fig.
2
). The oxidation state of gallium was examined by in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) during successive treatment of the catalyst with different gases (Fig.
2a
). The Ga XANES spectrum of Ga
2
O
3
/Al
2
O
3
shows two distinct contributions from tetrahedral oxygen-coordinated Ga
3+
cations (Ga
3+
(t)) and octahedral oxygen-coordinated Ga
3+
(Ga
3+
(o))
33
,
34
. After H
2
reduction at 600 °C, the Ga K-edge XANES spectrum exhibited a decrease in white line intensity and a shift of the edge to a lower energy (about −0.6 eV). Two phenomena could induce the Ga K-edge XANES shift, namely, (1) the reduction of gallium oxides resulting in the loss of Ga–O bonds and (2) the formation of Ga–H bonds
34
,
35
. As gallium hydride cannot survive without H
2
(ref.
36
), He purging was expected to restore the negative shift due to Ga–H bond formation. As expected, He purging produced a positive shift of about 0.2 eV. In addition, switching back to H
2
led to a negative shift of around 0.2 eV, further confirming the formation of gallium hydride in H
2
. Consequently, it can be concluded that during H
2
reduction at 600 °C, gallium oxide undergoes a partial reduction of Ga
3+
(t) and/or Ga
3+
(o) cations to Ga
δ
+
O
x
species, resulting in an irreversible negative shift in edge energy, along with the generation of metastable gallium hydride, leading to a reversible shift to lower energy.

In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also performed to quantify the reduced gallium species (Fig.
2b
). The fresh catalyst in Ar exhibited a Ga 2
p
3/2
peak centred at 1,118.8 eV, which can be ascribed to Ga
3+
species
37
. After H
2
reduction at 600 °C, the Ga 2
p
3/2
peak became obviously asymmetric and presented a negative shift of about 0.3 eV due to the contribution of reduced gallium species (Ga
δ
+
, 0 <
δ
< 3), found at 1,117.4 eV after spectral deconvolution
38
. It was calculated that approximately 25% of the surface Ga existed as Ga
δ
+
in the reduced catalyst (Supplementary Table
3
). The Ga
δ
+
content did not change significantly after the second H
2
reduction, suggesting a maximum reduction of gallium oxide surface. The catalyst was purged with Ar between reductions.
The evolution of adsorbed species on the catalyst surface during the reduction process was monitored by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). After exposing the fresh catalyst to H
2
, a broad band appeared at
∼
3,530 cm
−1
(Fig.
2c
). This band can be attributed to the stretching mode of O–H bonded to a Ga atom (ʋ(GaO–H)), which is distinguishable from the hydroxyl bands of aluminium (Extended Data Fig.
3a
)
39
. The intensity of this GaO–H band decreased as the reduction progressed. This suggests the removal of surface O atoms by dehydroxylation
22
, leading to a decrease in the coordination number of Ga. The reduction process was completed within
∼
30 min, as the GaO–H band gradually disappeared (Fig.
2c,g
). It is worth noting that two bands emerged at 2,013 and 1,981 cm
−1
and increased as the GaO–H band weakened. These two bands were assigned to the stretching modes of H atoms bonded to coordinatively unsaturated Ga atoms adjacent to O vacancies (ʋ(Ga
cus
–H)) at tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively
40
. Replacing H
2
with D
2
resulted in two bands appearing at 1,441 and 1,424 cm
−1
(Extended Data Fig.
3b,c
). The experimental ʋ(Ga
cus
–H)/ʋ(Ga
cus
–D) ratios were 1.40 and 1.39, respectively, consistent with the theoretical value of 1.40 (ref.
39
). Moreover, the rapid disappearance of the Ga
cus
–H bands on Ar purging indicated that the Ga
cus
–H species cannot survive without H
2
(Fig.
2d,f
). On re-exposure to H
2
, the Ga
cus
–H bands recovered quickly and completely, while the GaO–H band remained weak (Fig.
2e
). Furthermore, a reaction order of H
2
of
∼
0.54, close to 0.5, was calculated from the plot of Ga
cus
–H band intensity versus the partial pressure of H
2
(Extended Data Fig.
3d,e
), demonstrating that H
2
mainly underwent reversible and homolytic dissociation at Ga
cus
–Ga
cus
sites (H
2
+ 2Ga
cus
⇄
2Ga
cus
–H), forming metastable gallium hydrides.
These inferences were supported by in situ Raman spectroscopy (Extended Data Fig.
3f
). The initial dehydroxylation of the fresh catalyst in H
2
was verified by the decrease in the intensity of the band assigned to the GaO–H bending mode at 1,608 cm
−1
(ref.
41
), and the formation of gallium hydride was confirmed by the emergence of two bands at 2,030 and 2,000 cm
−1
, corresponding to the stretching modes of Ga
cus
–H at tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively. The replacement of H
2
by D
2
led to the appearance of two new bands at 1,464 and 1,442 cm
−1
, in agreement with the expected H–D isotope exchange.
The surface structure of gallium oxide under flowing H
2
was simulated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The surface energy (Δ
γ
) was calculated to evaluate the relative stabilities of the various products possible from the reduction of Ga
2
O
3
(100) with a series of H
2
partial pressures at 600 °C through ab initio thermodynamics
42
. We optimized 792 surfaces with different coverages of surface O vacancy, OH and Ga hydride. The obtained phase diagram indicates that the adsorbed H atom appears at the Ga atom adjacent to the oxygen vacancies (Supplementary Fig.
5a
). Bader charge analysis of the Ga
cus
–H surface determined a statistical average charge of 1.84
e
and a valence state of +1.16 for the surface Ga atoms (Supplementary Table
4
). Furthermore, the formation of gallium hydride is kinetically feasible. The free-energy barrier for the homolytic dissociative adsorption of H
2
on Ga
cus
–Ga
cus
site was calculated to be only 1.38 and 1.58 eV on different reconstructed surfaces of gallium oxide, while the free-energy barrier for heterolytic dissociative adsorption across the Ga–O bond can reach 2.24 and 2.07 eV (Supplementary Fig.
5b
). Therefore, H
2
prefers to undergo reversible and homolytic dissociation over the defective surface of gallium oxide, which leads to the transient generation of gallium hydride.
These results demonstrate the formation of metastable gallium hydride on the defective surface of alumina-supported gallium oxide on exposure to H
2
. We speculate that the resulting gallium hydride has a potentially positive effect on PDH catalysed by Lewis acidic Ga sites, based on recent advances in identifying the active site of Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolite, a bifunctional catalyst for the dehydroaromatization of alkanes applied in the industrial Cyclar process
18
,
43
. Some studies have found that Ga

cations adjacent to Brønsted acid sites catalyse dehydrogenation by forming [GaH]

as the active site for catalytic dehydrogenation

. Metastable gallium hydride is, therefore, expected to play a key role in improving the dehydrogenation activity of alumina-supported gallium oxide under reaction conditions with H
2
co-feeding.
Performance dependent on gallium hydride coverage
The existence of gallium hydride under the reaction conditions was examined by in situ DRIFTS. No Ga
cus
–H bands were observed in PDH without H
2
co-feeding (Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Fig.
4c
), whereas these bands grew rapidly and existed throughout the PDH process in the case of H
2
co-feeding with pre-reduced catalysts (Fig.
3b–e
). As expected, purging with Ar led to the rapid disappearance of the Ga
cus
–H bands (Fig.
3g–j
). These results clearly indicate the formation of metastable gallium hydride in PDH with H
2
co-feeding. In addition, no dehydroxylation was observed with the pre-reduced catalysts under the reaction conditions, indicating that the pre-reduction enables the catalyst to reach a higher degree of reduction (Fig.
3a–e
). The coverage of gallium hydride on the catalyst surface, represented by the intensity of the Ga
cus
–H band (
I
Ga–H
), increased with increasing inlet H

/C

H
8
ratio, which is highly consistent with the observed increase in dehydrogenation activity, represented by the rate of propylene formation (Fig.

and Supplementary Fig.

). The linear relationship between dehydrogenation activity and

/
\(P_{{\mathrm{H}}_2}\)
(H
2
partial pressure,
\({P}_{{\mathrm{H}}_2}\)
) (see Supplementary Section
3.4
for details) suggests the involvement of gallium hydride in the more efficient PDH (Fig.
3m
). In addition, it is generally accepted that carbon deposition is the main reason for the deactivation of PDH catalysts
16
. DRIFTS bands centred at 1,560–1,545 cm
−1
appeared in the PDH reaction and remained stable on purging with Ar (Fig.
3a–k
), which can be attributed to coke formation on the catalyst surface
48
. The amount of coke decreased with increasing gallium hydride coverage (Fig.
3a–k
), consistent with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of spent catalysts (Supplementary Fig.
6b
). This suggests that gallium hydride improves catalyst coking resistance.

Computational and kinetic analysis
The nature of the gallium hydride in the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction was further investigated by DFT calculations. A stepwise sequential dehydrogenation mechanism occurs on both the pristine surface Ga
2
O
3
(100) and the defective surface GaO
x
(100) (Fig.
4a
and Supplementary Fig.
7a,b
)
49
. The free-energy barriers for the first dehydrogenation step on these two surfaces were calculated to be 3.22 and 2.85 eV, respectively, and this is the rate-determining step. However, on the defective surface covered with gallium hydride Ga
cus
–H/GaO
x
(100), the free-energy barrier for the first dehydrogenation mediated by gallium hydride dropped to 2.63 eV, demonstrating that both Ga
cus
–H and Ga
cus
are required for the first C–H bond activation (Fig.
4a
and Supplementary Fig.
7c,d
). In addition to the sequential dehydrogenation mechanism, in which H
2
is formed after two sequential dehydrogenation steps, another mechanism emerges over the Ga
cus
–H sites. Specifically, the H atom in Ga
cus
–H combines with the H atom extracted from the C
3
H
8
molecule in the first dehydrogenation step to produce H
2
. The consumed H atom in Ga
cus
–H is subsequently replenished in the second dehydrogenation step (Supplementary Fig.
7d
). Moreover, the lower energy barrier for the first dehydrogenation step can be attributed to the lower energy for the sequential adsorption of C
3
H
7
(Supplementary Fig.
8a
). The stronger adsorption of C
3
H
7
on the defective surface (+1.39 eV) compared with on the pristine surface (+1.69 eV) is due to the significant increase in the bonding strength of C–Ga, as indicated by the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (Supplementary Fig.
8b
)
50
. To explain the still lower adsorption energy of C
3
H
7
on the gallium hydride-covered defective surface (+1.30 eV), we performed a natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis
51
to calculate the antibonding orbital occupancy of the C–Ga bond on the defective surfaces with and without gallium hydride; values of 0.38 and 0.42, respectively, were determined (Fig.
4f
), showing a stronger bonding of C–Ga induced by gallium hydride. Furthermore, the barrier for the dehydrogenation of adsorbed C
3
H
6
on the gallium hydride-covered defective surface (2.01 eV) is much higher than on the pristine and defective surfaces (0.85 and 1.67 eV, respectively; Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Fig.
9
), which explains the improved propylene selectivity and coking resistance of the catalyst due to pre-reduction and H
2
co-feeding.

Kinetic isotope experiments were also performed to further confirm the proposed metastable gallium hydride-mediated reaction mechanism. As proposed, for PDH with H
2
co-feeding, the dissociative adsorption of H
2
on the catalyst surface as a fast step leads to the formation of metastable gallium hydride, which lowers the energy barrier for C–H bond activation in propane, which is the rate-determining step. The results of the TPSR for H
2
/D
2
isotope scrambling showed a much lower onset temperature of H
2
dissociation (
∼
100 °C; Supplementary Fig.
8c
) than C–H bond activation in propane (
∼
325 °C; Fig.
1c
), indicating that the former is much easier than the latter and therefore a fast step. To further clarify whether C–H bond activation or H
2
desorption is the rate-determining step, deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) in H
2
and/or C
3
H
8
were measured, and the rate of propylene formation was found to be highly proportional to the partial pressure of propane in tests performed using different feeds, suggesting a first-order regime in propane that is independent of feed composition (Fig.
4c–e
and Supplementary Fig.
10a,b
). Co-feeding D
2
instead of H
2
led to an increase in the rate of C
3
H
6
formation, showing an inverse deuterium KIE (
\(k_{{\mathrm{H}}_2}/k_{{\mathrm{D}}_2}\)
;
∼
0.79 and
∼
0.76 in Fig.
4c
and Supplementary Fig.
10a
, respectively). Given that D binds more strongly to Ga
cus
than H, as evidenced by the higher desorption temperature for D
2
than for H
2
(Supplementary Fig.
8d–h
), if H
2
desorption were the rate-determining step, the rate of propylene formation would theoretically decrease when D
2
rather than H
2
was co-fed. Therefore, the inverse D KIE (
\(k_{{\mathrm{H}}_2}/k_{{\mathrm{D}}_2}\)
) excludes H
2
desorption as the rate-determining step. Moreover, replacing C
3
H
8
with C
3
D
8
resulted in a substantially reduced rate of propylene formation, with a primary deuterium KIE (
\(k_{{\mathrm{C}}_3{\mathrm{H}}_8}/k_{{\mathrm{C}}_3{\mathrm{D}}_8}\)
) of
∼
2.0 (Fig.
4d
). Combining the inverse D KIE (
\(k_{{\mathrm{H}}_2}/k_{{\mathrm{D}}_2}\)
) and the primary D KIE (
\(k_{{\mathrm{C}}_3{\mathrm{H}}_8}/k_{{\mathrm{C}}_3{\mathrm{D}}_8}\)
), it can be concluded that C–H bond activation is the rate-determining step.
Nine kinetic models were developed for PDH on GaO
x
/Al
2
O
3
according to whether gallium hydride is involved in the first or second dehydrogenation and whether the rate-determining step is the first dehydrogenation, the second dehydrogenation or H
2
desorption (Supplementary Table
5
). The order of the rate of propylene formation with respect to H
2
is positive (>0) only if the first dehydrogenation mediated by gallium hydride is the rate-determining step, in agreement with the observed positive dependence of dehydrogenation activity on the H
2
partial pressure. Moreover, when H
2
is replaced by D
2
, the inverse D KIE (
\(k_{{\mathrm{H}}_2}/k_{{\mathrm{D}}_2}\)
) can be attributed to a higher proportion of the more efficient pathway for propylene formation (Supplementary Section
3.2
), which is confirmed by the almost identical energy profile of PDH mediated by Ga
cus
–H and Ga
cus
–D, but a higher surface coverage of D than H (Supplementary Fig.
8e–i
). This coverage effect also explains the strong dependence of
E
a
on the partial pressure of H
2
(Fig.
1d
). According to the developed kinetic model (equation (31) in Supplementary Table
5
), two pathways for propylene formation (with or without the first dehydrogenation mediated by gallium hydride) exist simultaneously in PDH with H
2
co-feeding. The partial pressure of H
2
determines the coverage of gallium hydride, which in turn determines the proportion of each of the two pathways, resulting in different
E
a
at different H
2
partial pressures (Supplementary Section
3.3
).
H
2
co-feeding benefits extended
Such promoting effects of H
2
can also be extended to other gallium oxide-based catalysts. For alumina-supported gallium oxide catalysts with trace additives (for example, 0.05 wt% Ir and 0.25 wt% K), H
2
co-feeding has an even more significantly positive effect on PDH. In situ DRIFTS under the reaction conditions with the same inlet H

(Fig.

). Correspondingly, the rate of propylene formation due to H

co-feeding increased in the same order (Fig.

and Supplementary Fig.

). It is noteworthy that this increase shows a good linear relationship with
I
Ga–H

\(P_{{\mathrm{H}}_2}\)
(Fig.

), which agrees with the results derived from the kinetic model (see Supplementary Section

co-feeding led to increases in propane conversion from

Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated that metastable gallium hydrides promote catalytic dehydrogenation. Metastable H atoms adsorbed on coordinatively unsaturated Ga atoms adjacent to O vacancies improve the catalytic properties of the Lewis acidic Ga
δ
+
sites on alumina-supported gallium oxide for PDH. Under reaction conditions with H
2
co-feeding, reversible and homolytic dissociative adsorption of H
2
on the defective surface of gallium oxide leads to the transient generation of gallium hydride, lowering the reaction barrier and making the production of propylene more efficient. This adsorbate-mediated catalysis provides inspiration for the regulation of active-site structures and reaction mechanisms in heterogeneous catalyst systems.

Catalytic testing
The catalysts were tested in a quartz fixed-bed reactor (8 mm inner diameter and 24 cm length) under atmospheric pressure. A mixture (1 ml) of 30–200 mg catalyst and quartz sand (20–40 mesh size) was loaded into the tubular quartz reactor. The catalysts were first heated to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min
−1
in N

(50 ml min

). Afterwards, a mixture of C

H

was fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 50 ml min

. The inlet concentrations of C

were varied from 0 to 40 vol% by changing the flow rate of C

while keeping the total flow rate constant. For the pre-reduction, after heating to 600 °C, the catalysts were treated in 42 vol% H

(50 ml min
