Heterogeneous catalysis
Abstract
The use of oxide-supported isolated Pt-group metal atoms as catalytic active sites is of interest due to their unique reactivity and efficient metal utilization. However, relationships between the structure of these active sites, their dynamic response to environments and catalytic functionality have proved difficult to experimentally establish. Here, sinter-resistant catalysts where Pt was deposited uniformly as isolated atoms in well-defined locations on anatase TiO
2
nanoparticle supports were used to develop such relationships. Through a combination of in situ atomic-resolution microscopy- and spectroscopy-based characterization supported by first-principles calculations it was demonstrated that isolated Pt species can adopt a range of local coordination environments and oxidation states, which evolve in response to varied environmental conditions. The variation in local coordination showed a strong influence on the chemical reactivity and could be exploited to control the catalytic performance.

Main
The synthesis of oxide-supported Pt-group catalysts typically produces metal particles with dimensions of a few nanometres
1
. Recent work has shown that Pt-group species can coexist as nanoparticles and single atoms
2
,
3
,
4
, and that careful synthetic approaches can produce exclusively single atoms
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
. Interest in the reactivity of supported isolated Pt atoms (Pt
iso
) and other rare metals stems from the maximized metal utilization efficiency, unique reactivity or selectivity, connection to organometallic catalysis and the potential for making well-defined active sites
8
,
9
,
10
. It has proved challenging to characterize the intrinsic catalytic activity of these dispersed active sites on oxide supports at a level that relates local electronic and geometric structure to function. The difficulty arises from their atomic dispersion, heterogeneity in the local coordination of active sites on most catalysts (that is, isolated species sit at different sites on the support)
11
, dynamic changes in local coordination under reactive environments
12
and often the low loading of metal that is required to achieve site isolation
13
. Exploring the dynamic restructuring of supported metal catalysts has long been of interest
14
,
15
,
16
, with recent experimental work analysing the dynamic formation and fragmentation of supported ~1 nm metal clusters under reactive environments
17
,
18
,
19
, but similar insights into the dynamic behaviour of dispersed Pt-group species have been difficult to develop
20
.
In this work, using a sinter-resistant catalyst consisting of Pt
iso
species uniformly deposited at a well-defined location on a nanoparticle anatase TiO
2
support, we demonstrate that environmental conditions dictate the local coordination and charge state of Pt
iso
species, which are related to chemical and catalytic reactivity. Insights into the evolution of local coordination and properties of Pt
iso
species in response to varying environmental conditions were provided by in situ spectroscopy and microscopy correlated to first-principles calculations.
Catalysts were synthesized via strong electrostatic adsorption
21
(see Supplementary Fig.
1
) to deposit [Pt(NH

)

]
2+
complexes onto 5-nm-diameter anatase TiO
2
nanocrystals at a weight loading of ~0.025%, which correlates to nominally ~0.5 Pt atoms per TiO
2
particle
22
. Through controlled deposition of on average <1 Pt atom per TiO
2
particle, Pt cluster formation was mitigated by the energetically difficult transfer of Pt atoms between TiO
2
particles, enabling analysis of Pt
iso
species under conditions where they are mobile but unable to form clusters. Before analysis, catalysts were calcined in air at 450 °C to remove remaining ligands from synthesis.
To understand the influence of environmental conditions on the local environment of Pt
iso
species, CO probe molecule Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was executed at −140 °C following pretreatment of the catalyst in oxidative and reductive conditions. Figure
1a
shows normalized FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed at −140 °C on Pt
iso
/TiO
2
following pretreatment via in situ oxidation (300 °C in O
2
), mild reduction (250 °C in H
2
) or harsh reduction (450 °C in H
2
). Different characteristics of adsorbed CO were observed: (1) oxidation resulted in an adsorbed CO stretching frequency of 2,135 cm
−1
with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 13.5 cm
−1
, (2) mild reduction resulted in an adsorbed CO stretching frequency of 2,112 cm
−1
and a FWHM of 10.5 cm
−1
and (3) harsh reduction resulted in two CO stretching frequencies centred at 2,077 and 2,050 cm
−1
with a FWHM of 28 and 36 cm
−1
, respectively. These vibrational frequencies are generally consistent with CO bound to (1, 2) cationic Pt
22
, and (3) near-neutral, Pt
δ+
, sites
23
,
24
,
25
,
26
. The local coordination and oxidation state of the Pt
iso
species can influence the vibrational frequency of CO. Thus, unambiguous determination of the Pt
iso
oxidation state on the basis of adsorbed CO stretching frequency alone is not possible
27
. Re-oxidation of the catalyst following harsh reduction and exposure to CO showed the same sharp stretches and desorption below room temperature observed for Pt
iso
exposed to oxidation conditions (see Supplementary Fig.
2
for details), which is in contrast to Pt
x
O
y
clusters produced by oxidation of 1 nm Pt nanoparticles that bind CO strongly (desorption above 200 °C)
22
. This suggested retained existence of Pt
iso
species following harsh reduction.

The FWHM of adsorbed CO stretches after oxidation (13.5 cm
−1
) and mild reduction (10.5 cm
−1
) were narrower than reports of zeolite-supported Pt
iso
species, where well-defined anchoring sites are present (15–25 cm

)
28
, and Pt
iso
species on other oxide supports (>25 cm

for Pt
iso
/CeO
2
, FeO
x
and so on)
4
,
5
,
6
. A comparable ~10 cm
−1
FWHM for the adsorbed CO stretch was reported for Pt
iso
species at a well-defined location on a Cu
2
O model system in a surface science study
25
, which provides evidence that following oxidation and mild reduction pretreatments the Pt
iso
species observed here were predominately located at a single adsorption site on the support
11
. The similar FWHM of the CO stretch following both pretreatments suggests that Pt
iso
species did not move significantly between the two pretreatments, and that a modification in local coordination or Pt oxidation state induced the change in adsorbed CO stretch frequency. By contrast, harsh reduction resulted in broadened CO stretches with FWHMs of 28 cm
−1
and 36 cm
−1
, accompanied by a decrease in vibrational frequency. This suggests that Pt
iso
species were reduced to a near-neutral charge state, became mobile on the TiO
2
surface and adopted a range of coordination environments.
Following CO adsorption at −140 °C, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were executed (Supplementary Fig.
3
). The intensities of the CO stretches were normalized to saturation coverage (Fig.
1a
), and are shown as a function of temperature in Fig.
1b
. During the TPD measurement, the CO stretch frequency, symmetry and FWHM were essentially constant for the oxidized and mildly reduced cases, providing evidence that Pt
iso
species were spatially separated and existed in a predominant local environment (Supplementary Fig.
3
). CO adsorption energies estimated using Redhead analysis
29
on mildly and harshly reduced Pt
iso
/TiO
2
were 84 kJ mol
−1
and 115–145 kJ mol
−1
, respectively (see Supplementary Fig.
3
and associated discussion
30
). The inferred CO binding energy for the harshly reduced case is significantly weaker than what has been reported for small Pt clusters, substantiating the assertion that Pt remained as isolated atoms throughout all pretreatments
30
. In the case of oxidized Pt
iso
/TiO
2
, CO
2
evolution was observed to occur simultaneously with CO desorption initiating at −110 °C, and thus a CO adsorption energy was not estimated (Supplementary Figs.
4
and
5
).
To relate variations in Pt
iso
properties to catalytic reactivity, CO oxidation was performed under strict kinetic control (Supplementary Fig.
6
). This reaction has been extensively studied with atomically dispersed Pt catalysts due to the interest in decreasing Pt loading in automotive exhaust applications
31
. Figure
1c
shows that the reactivities of Pt
iso
sites following oxidation and mild reduction were similar, with apparent activation energies,
E
a
, in the range of 70–80 kJ mol
−1
. By contrast, following harsh reduction, Pt
iso
sites showed an increase in activity of two- to fivefold, depending on temperature, and a decrease in
E
a
to 48 kJ mol
−1
, close to the
E
a
for small Pt clusters on TiO
2
of 53 kJ mol
−1
(ref.
22
). CO and O
2
partial-pressure-dependent measurements and microkinetic modelling suggested that CO oxidation proceeded by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism with kinetically relevant O
2
dissociation at the interface of an oxygen vacancy in TiO
2
and Pt
iso
for all pretreatment conditions (see Supplementary Figs.
7
and
8
and associated discussion). The rate law is consistent with reports of metal clusters on reducible oxide supports, where metal atoms at the interface with the support serve as the active site
32
. Pt
iso
/TiO
2
catalysts exhibited comparable apparent activation barriers and turnover frequencies to the smallest Pt clusters on reducible oxides
22
, which have enhanced CO oxidation activity per surface metal atom compared to small Pt clusters supported on irreducible oxides
33
and unsupported Pt
34
.
The results in Fig.
1
suggest that during oxidation and mild reduction pretreatments Pt
iso
species did not significantly move on the TiO
2
surface, but existed in distinct local coordination environments when probed by CO at −140 °C. On the basis of the similarities in site location and steady-state catalytic reactivity, it is hypothesized Pt
iso
species pretreated by oxidation and mild reduction dynamically evolved to similar local coordination environments under CO oxidation conditions. By contrast, harsh reduction induced mobility and left Pt
iso
species in close-to-neutral states. It is hypothesized that the near-neutral Pt charge state facilitated the rate-limiting O
2
dissociation step in CO oxidation, as compared to the more cationic state of Pt
iso
species that existed following pre-oxidation and mild reduction (see discussion in
Supplementary Information
, step 4 in mechanism).
In situ aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) at atmospheric pressure was executed to examine the mobility of Pt atoms on the TiO
2
support and corroborate inferences from infrared measurements. An in situ AC-STEM experiment was performed on Pt
iso
/TiO
2
during sequential exposure to 760 torr of O
2
at 300 °C, 760 torr of 5% H
2
at 250 °C and 760 torr of 5% H
2
at 450 °C. Small probe currents and minimal acquisition times were used to minimize beam effects (see
Supplementary Information
for discussion). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability to conduct these measurements without artefacts from electron beam effects or sample drift

Figure
2a
shows a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM image of one Pt
iso
species on TiO
2
following 30 min of in situ oxidation treatment. After 30 min of exposure to H
2
at 250 °C, this Pt atom remained at the same location on the TiO
2
support (Fig.
2b
). Following 30 min of exposure to H
2
at 450 °C, the Pt atom moved 1.6 nm, demonstrating mobility imparted to the single Pt atom without the formation of a Pt cluster. Line-scan intensity analysis and in situ STEM experiments as a function of time were used to substantiate the identification of Pt
iso
species and demonstrate that the electron beam did not induce Pt motion (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Fig.
9
). While exposure to H
2
at 450 °C induced mobility of the Pt atom, a relatively stable adsorption site must have been reached to allow the atom to be imaged. Exposure to H
2
at 450 °C also induced minor structural changes in TiO
2
, demonstrated by the loss of visible lattice fringes in Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Fig.
9
. The direct imaging of induced Pt
iso
mobility only during the harsh reduction pretreatment and the structural modification of TiO
2
are consistent with inferences made on the basis of sample-averaged infrared measurements, substantiating the hypothesis that Pt
iso
species adopted a range of local coordination environments following harsh reduction.

In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments were executed under pretreatment and reaction conditions to provide complementary sample-averaged information regarding the evolution of the Pt
iso
oxidation state and local coordination
37
. Figure
3a
shows in situ Pt L
3
-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra for each state of the catalyst (see
Supplementary Information
for experimental details). For the pretreated samples (before CO oxidation), the white-line intensity decreased in the order of oxidized > mildly reduced > harshly reduced, consistent with the trends in oxidation state inferred from the infrared measurements, although again we refrain from explicitly assigning oxidation states based on the XANES alone (see
Supplementary Information
for discussion). Extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectra associated with these states of the catalyst (shown in Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Table
1
) demonstrate: lack of measurable Pt–Pt scattering for all pretreatments, consistent with the assertion that Pt remained atomically dispersed in all explored conditions; a decrease in the extent of Pt–O coordination comparing oxidizing to reducing conditions; and well-defined Pt–O and Pt–Ti scattering paths for the pre-oxidized and mildly reduced catalysts, indicating uniformity in the local coordination of the Pt single atoms.

XANES and EXAFS measurements obtained under CO oxidation reaction conditions showed that the Pt
iso
species evolved, with the Pt in the oxidized and mildly reduced states approaching a similar oxidation state and local coordination environment under CO oxidation conditions (Fig.
3b,c
). This rationalizes the similarity in observed reactivity and is consistent with the similar location of the Pt atom in both cases. Measurements under CO oxidation conditions following harsh reduction showed that the nearly neutral Pt state was maintained. This is consistent with the enhanced reactivity in CO oxidation observed for this sample, as a more neutral Pt atom would be expected to more effectively facilitate the rate-limiting O
2
dissociation step.
To develop structural models of the local coordination of Pt
iso
species on TiO
2
, ex situ STEM images were collected along various zone axes of the TiO
2
support for Pt
iso
/TiO
2
following 250 ˚C reduction in H
2
(see
Supplementary Information
). Figure
4a
presents a HAADF-STEM image taken along the [021] zone axis of anatase TiO
2
, where (100) and (
\(01\bar 2\)
) planes are indexed in the atomic-resolution image. Ti and O atomic columns are not overlapping in this projection and from the
Z
-contrast the visible spots in Fig.
4a
must correspond to Ti atoms
38
. The brighter spots (highlighted by the yellow circles), exhibited a higher
Z
-contrast than surrounding Ti columns, corresponding to the existence of Pt single atoms
22
. The intensity profile (Fig.
4b
) taken along the lines indicated by the yellow arrows in Fig.
4a
, and along the perpendicular direction across the same Pt atom (Supplementary Fig.
11
), demonstrates that this is the case. Thus, following 250 °C reduction Pt atoms sat in place of, or above the position of Ti columns (see also Supplementary Fig.
12
). On the basis of the in situ STEM in Fig.
2
, it is assumed that Pt
iso
species must also sit in place of, or above, the position of Ti columns following oxidation, and probably at a range of positions on the TiO
2
surface following harsh reduction.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to identify stable Pt
iso
structures on the (101) terrace and (145) stepped surfaces of anatase TiO
2
(ref.
39
), and to supplement recently reported calculations (see Supplementary Figs.
13
–
16
and
Supplementary Information
for details
30
). Among the considered structures, (PtO
2
)
ads
species at the (101) anatase TiO
2
terrace, where the Pt atom is bound to two extra O atoms on the surface, showed excellent agreement with observed characteristics for mildly reduced Pt
iso
/TiO
2
including the CO vibrational frequency (2,112 cm
−1
measured versus 2,121 cm
−1
calculated) and CO adsorption energy (84 kJ mol
−1
measured versus 103 kJ mol
−1
calculated). Good agreement was also found between characteristics of (PtO
2
)
ads
at the (145) TiO
2
step site and the experimental results, with calculated CO vibrational frequency and adsorption energy of 2,107 cm
−1
and 50 kJ mol
−1
, respectively. The (PtO
2
)
ads
structures at either the step or terrace site of TiO
2
are consistent with STEM measurements, showing Pt in line with Ti cation columns when observed along the [021] axis (see Fig.
4c
).
Calculations of CO adsorbing to Pt
iso
species replacing a six-fold coordinated Ti (Ti
6c
) atom at the bottom of the (145) step edge, or on the (101) terrace, showed barrierless CO
2
formation, which agreed with experimental observations for oxidized Pt
iso
/TiO
2
(Supplementary Figs.
4
and
5
). This Ti
6c
-substituted Pt position is vertically in line with (PtO
2
)
ads
along the <021> zone axis, consistent with the lack of lateral motion observed for Pt
iso
species between oxidation and mild reduction conditions via in situ STEM. Finally, CO adsorbed to (PtOH)
ads
species on the TiO
2
step and terrace sites showed reasonable agreement with the measured vibrational frequencies (2,068 cm
−1
, step, and 2,087 cm
−1
, terrace, calculated, versus 2,050 and 2,077 cm
−1
, measured) and adsorption energies (184 kJ mol
−1
, step, and 210 kJ mol
−1
, terrace, versus 115–145 kJ mol
−1
, measured), given the known over-prediction of CO binding energy in DFT calculations
40
. Observable changes to the TiO
2
support after harsh reduction indicate that this pretreatment introduced surface defects, resulting in a variety of sites for (PtOH)
ads
species to occupy.
The DFT-calculated structures described above (Pt at the Ti
6c
site, (PtO
2
)
ads
and (PtOH)
ads
) were used to calculate Pt L
3
-edge XANES spectra, which showed agreement in shape and white-line intensity with the experimental measurements (Supplementary Fig.
17
). Fitting of EXAFS data after pretreatment showed close agreement in coordination numbers (CNs) and bond distances with the DFT-predicted structures (Supplementary Tables
1
and
2
, respectively). In particular, oxidation resulted in Pt–O CNs of 6.0 ± 0.7 with a bond distance of 2.0 ± 0.1 Å, consistent with the calculated structure of Pt sitting in an octahedral Ti site at the (145) step edge (CN of 6, bond distance of 1.97–2.04 Å). Mild reduction decreased the total first shell Pt–O coordination, with two distinct Pt–O bond distances of 1.90 ± 0.05 (CN 1.2 ± 0.6) and 2.10 ± .05 (CN 1.7 ± 0.7). This showed agreement with the calculated structure of (PtO
2
)
ads
at the (145) step edge, with 1 Pt–O bond distance of 1.83 (CN 2) and 1 Pt–O bond distance of 2.13 (CN 2). Agreement between fits to experimental spectra and theory was also found beyond first-shell fits. EXAFS fitting was not performed on spectra taken under reaction conditions, due to uncertainty in description of a physical model for these structures.
On the basis of the comparison of the experimental and calculated characteristics of the different states of the Pt
iso
species, it is proposed that oxidation of Pt
iso
/TiO
2
resulted in Pt substituting into the Ti
6c
position; mild reduction pulled Pt
iso
out of the lattice to form (PtO
2
)
ads
species; and harsh reduction induced the formation of (PtOH)
ads
species that were mobile and adsorbed to both step and terrace sites on the support (Fig.
4d
). Based on the better agreement of the calculated and measured XANES and EXAFS characteristics for the oxidized and mildly reduced Pt
iso
species at the TiO
2
(145) step edge, as compared to the (101) terrace, it is hypothesized that Pt
iso
species were predominantly located at TiO
2
step edges. The proposed Pt
iso
structures have formal oxidation states of +4 for Pt substituted at the Ti
6c
site, +2 for (PtO
2
)
ads
and +1 for (PtOH)
ads
. These charge assignments are consistent with trends from XANES, infrared and Bader charge analysis (see Supplementary Tables
2
and
3
and
Supplementary Information
for discussion). While Pt charge-state estimations showed consistent trends, each method has unique limitations in the ability to quantitatively describe charge states and exact values are dependent on the method used
41
.
Future analysis aims to interrogate the mechanism of transformations between these various states of the Pt
iso
species and how these states are modified by exposure to CO oxidation conditions. We expect that these changes were driven not only by energetics of the Pt cation, but also by structural transformations of reducible supports. For example, TiO
2
surfaces are known to become mobile following high-temperature reduction
14
. Future work will investigate how these structural transformations depend on choice of support. It is hypothesized that here the transition from (PtO
2
)
ads
to (PtOH)
ads
occurs by release of the first O atom, forming H
2
O, and hydroxylation of the second O atom during high-temperature reduction, consistent with observations of temperature-programmed reduction experiments (Supplementary Fig.
18
).
Pt
iso
species can adopt a range of local coordination environments, which dynamically form in response to varied environmental conditions, analogous to the dynamic behaviour of metal ions in zeolites
42
. This variation in local coordination showed a strong influence on the chemical reactivity and catalytic performance for systems where the Pt
iso
active site was adsorbed at well-defined locations on the support. This work demonstrates that to understand the behaviour of atomically dispersed catalysts at the level of defining structure–function relationships, it is not sufficient to merely show that all metal species are atomically dispersed; a detailed characterization of the uniformity of the local coordination environment and how this local coordination responds to environmental conditions must be considered.
Methods
Catalyst preparation
The synthesis of Pt
iso
catalysts on TiO
2
has been reported previously

. Briefly, a pH-adjusted solution (12.2) containing tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate was slowly injected into a solution containing TiO
2
(anatase, 5 nm diameter, 290 m
2
g
−1
, US Research Nanomaterials). After drying, the catalyst was calcined in a tube furnace at 450 °C for 4 h in flowing air after ramping up the temperature at a rate of 10 °C min
−1
.
Infrared spectroscopy
FTIR experiments were carried out in a diffuse reflectance reaction chamber (Harrick Scientific) equipped with ZnSe windows, mounted inside a Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance adapter (Harrick Scientific), and coupled to a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrometer with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT-A) detector. During measurements, the FTIR and Praying Mantis diffuse reflection accessory were purged with dry N
2
.
Electron microscopy
AC-STEM was performed on a JEOL Grand ARM300CF microscope equipped with two spherical aberration correctors, operated at 200 kV. HAADF-STEM images were recorded using a convergence semi-angle of 22 mrad, and inner- and outer- collection angles of 83 and 165 mrad, respectively. To minimize beam irradiation, a small beam current (<10 pA) was used for imaging, while the acquisition time was always controlled to be less than 12 s for each frame. In situ STEM experiments were performed in a Protochips Atmosphere gas cell system, which allows for dynamic observation of nanomaterials heated under atmospheric pressure inside a transmission electron microscope.
XAS measurements
XAS spectra were collected at beamline 9-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at the SLAC National Laboratory. In the experiments, 16 mg of 0.025 wt% Pt/TiO
2
was diluted in mesoporous silica (MCM-41) and loaded into a flow-through quartz tube, with an outer diameter of 3.0 mm and an inner diameter of 2.8 mm, held at a 45° angle relative to the X-ray beam
43
. Fluorescence XAS measurements were collected using a Canberra 100-element Ge detector orthogonal (90°) to the beam path with 4 layers of Al foil to filter Ti fluorescence lines, as well as lead shielding to minimize contributions from scattering of beamline optics. A Pt foil reference was scanned simultaneously for energy calibration.
The raw data were processed using the Athena interface of the Demeter software package
44
. The spectra were energy-calibrated, merged and normalized. The EXAFS was extracted in
k
-space and Fourier-transformation was conducted on the
k
2
-weighted EXAFS function (
k
= 3.0–12.0 Å
−1
) to amplify the oscillations at high
k
-values. Phase shifts and amplitudes for relevant back-scattering paths were calculated using FEFF6.
Kinetic control and reactivity experimental details
After pretreatment and 12 h exposure at 200 °C in a feed of 1% CO, 1% O
2
and 98% He, temperature-dependent measurements were taken between 150 °C and 200 °C, for 2 h at each temperature. Catalyst dilution studies showed that differences in activity between the catalysts are of kinetic origins, rather than a result of mass and heat transport limitations. Partial-pressure-dependent measurements were executed at 200 °C.
DFT computational methods
Spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package
45
. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation was used
46
. The self-interaction error inherent in DFT calculations was partly corrected using the DFT +
U
approach where the Hubbard’s
U
parameter was empirically set to 3 eV
47
. The projector augmented wave
48
,
49
method was used and the valence electrons explicitly treated were: Ti(3
s
2
, 3
p
6
, 3
d
2
, 4
s
2
), Pt (5
p
6
, 5
d
9
, 6
s
1
), O (2
s
2
, 2
p
4
), C (2
s
2
, 2
p
2
) and H (1
s
1
). We used a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV and the calculation was performed at the gamma point. The optimized structures were considered converged when the ionic forces were <0.01 eV Å
−1
.
We adopted the models of (3 × 1) and (2 × 1) supercell slabs including five atomic layers for the anatase TiO
2
(101) or the stepped TiO
2
(145) surfaces, respectively. A vacuum of more than 15 Å was used to avoid the interaction between slabs
50
. The TiO
2
(101) surface terminates with two types of Ti cation, five-fold coordinated Ti (Ti
5c
) and six-fold coordinated Ti (Ti
6c
), and two types of O anion, two-fold coordinated O sites (O
2c
) and three-fold coordinated O sites (O
3c
).
CO adsorption energies were calculated as the difference between isolated species and the adsorption complexes. The CO frequencies were computed within the harmonic approximation, in which CO and its first neighbouring atoms were considered in the calculation. In the gas phase, the CO bond length (1.144 Å) and stretching frequency (2,125 cm
−1
) were obtained at the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof level. A scaling factor
α
= 2,143/2,125 = 1.0085 was applied to all frequencies to take into account the difference with respect to the experimental CO frequency in the gas phase (2,143 cm
−1
).
