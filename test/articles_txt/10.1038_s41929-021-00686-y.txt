Abstract
Efficient and direct conversion of methane to value-added products has been a long-term challenge in shale gas applications. Here, we show that atomically thin nanolayers of Pt with a single or double atomic layer thickness, supported on a two-dimensional molybdenum titanium carbide (MXene), catalyse non-oxidative coupling of methane to ethane/ethylene (C
2
). Kinetic and theoretical studies, combined with in-situ spectroscopic and microscopic characterizations, demonstrate that Pt nanolayers anchored at the hexagonal close-packed sites of the MXene support can activate the first C–H bond of methane to form methyl radicals that favour desorption over further dehydrogenation and thus suppress coke deposition. At 750 °C and 7% methane conversion, the catalyst runs for 72 hours of continuous operation without deactivation and exhibits >98% selectivity towards C
2
products, with a turnover frequency of 0.2–0.6 s
−1
. Our findings provide insights into the design of highly active and stable catalysts for methane activation and create a platform for developing atomically thin supported metal catalysts.

19
; layered Au clusters coexisted with single Au atoms in Au/α-MoC catalysts
14
; and atomically thin NM monolayers were coated on the surface of tungsten carbide nanoparticles to form core–shell architectures
20
. These advances together, with the thermal and chemical stability of TMCs, hint that surfaces of group VIB TMCs are ideal for spreading supported NMs, but the interfaces that anchor the nanolayers remain unknown, leading to complexity and uncertainty in understanding the formation and catalytic performance of ATNLs.
The recent boom of shale gas has stimulated renewed interest in C–H bond cleavage as the initial step towards direct conversion of methane to value-added products
21
,
22
,
23
. Non-oxidative methane coupling is an appealing approach, with high carbon utilization efficiency and low emission
21
. Pt catalysts exhibit satisfactory activity for this chemistry but suffer from rapid deactivation due to deposition of coke, which covers the active sites
24
. The challenges to achieving stable methane conversion and maintaining activity lie in activating the first C–H bond while inhibiting deep dehydrogenation and preserving highly dispersed active sites at high temperatures (>700 °C).
Here, we report that the conditions in direct methane conversion can be met by ATNLs of Pt supported on a two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum titanium carbide (MXenes). MXene refers to a burgeoning family of 2D metal carbides and nitrides with a general formula of M

MXenes, where the first-layer Pt atoms favourably occupy the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) sites above the topmost C atoms of the support. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in-situ spectroscopy suggest that Pt ATNLs are stabilized by Pt–Mo bonding that alters the electronic structure of Pt atoms. The 5

states of the Pt ATNLs are shifted to higher energy, which activates C–H bonds with weaker adsorption of CH

contrast than the underlying Mo MXene support (Fig.

MXene. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings (Fig.

MXene, forming rhombic patterns (marked by red circles) that are characteristic of Pt monolayers (Fig.

. Moreover, continuous lattice fringes across the metal–support interfaces were observed (Fig.
1f
), indicating epitaxial growth of the Pt nanolayers on the Mo
2
TiC

MXene. Detailed crystal structure analysis (Supplementary Figs.

and

) showed that epitaxial Pt nanolayers with an average size of ~2.2 nm aligned their (111) planes with the (0001) planes of the MXene support, leading to an epitaxial relationship of [111]Pt//[0001]Mo

MXenes.
Our experimental results suggest that the chemisorption of Pt atoms on the hcp sites of the MXene support, through metal–support bonding, can account for the formation of atomically thin Pt nanolayers. DFT calculations were thus performed to assess the interface formation energies (see Supplementary Note
1
for details) of Pt by three different sites on the basal plane of Mo

: Mo atop sites, face-centred cubic (fcc) sites and hcp sites (Fig.

). When Pt is coordinated on an hcp site (Fig.
1i
), the binding of Pt is more favoured (−1.62 eV per Pt atom) than the weaker adsorption on the fcc (−1.38 eV per Pt atom) and Mo atop (−1.00 eV per Pt atom) sites (Supplementary Fig.
4
). Figure
1j
shows the calculated interface formation energies for Pt nanolayers and nanoparticles along with the structures in the inset figures. We found that the atomically thin Pt monolayer is the most stable structure with the lowest energy compared to the nanoparticle structures. Moreover, a comparison of the two nanoparticle geometries shows that with a decrease in the number of interfacial Mo–Pt bonds, the energy of the system increases, further illustrating the preference of Pt atoms to form single or double atomically thin layers with a maximum number of Pt atoms bonded to the MXene surface, rather than nanoparticle- or nanopillar-type structures where more Pt–Pt bonds are formed.

). Thermodynamically, both a low methane pressure and a high operating temperature promote the formation of the desired ethane/ethylene (Supplementary Fig.
5
), as well as undesired coke precursors (Supplementary Fig.

). From a kinetic perspective, for the series of reactions converting methane to ethane/ethylene followed by benzene/naphthalene, the effect of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was investigated as shown in Fig.

, with the results being the average of at least three independent tests. The methane conversion increased with decreasing GHSV for all catalysts. Both high Pt loading and low GHSV contributed to coke accumulation, resulting in rapid deactivation of the catalysts. Among all tested catalysts, the 0.5% Pt/Mo

titration method (

catalysts, suggesting that thick Pt nanostructures that promote coke deposition start to form at higher Pt loadings (>0.5%). HAADF-STEM further confirms that raft-like nanoflakes that are longer than 20 nm were formed in the high Pt loading (1% and 2%) catalysts (Supplementary Figs.
10
and
11
). The dispersions of low Pt loading catalysts (0.25% and 0.5%) are close to 100%, indicating the formation of ATNLs, which is consistent with the results of HAADF-STEM and DFT calculations. It should be noted that all these TOF values fell within a relatively narrow range (0.2–0.6 s

(Supplementary Table

Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) was carried out over 0.5% Pt/Mo
2

T

to investigate the effect of the operating temperature on product distribution. As shown in Fig.
2f
, methane was not efficiently activated until 600 °C. At 600–700 °C, a trace amount of ethane was found as the only product, while at 700–800 °C both ethane and ethylene were generated from methane coupling. Trace amounts of acetylene (C
2
H
2
) and benzene were also detectable as by-products. At higher operating temperatures (>800 °C), ethane dehydrogenation led to more ethylene as well as undesired acetylene and benzene (coke precursors), rapidly deactivating the catalyst. Figure
2g
presents the mass spectrum of a sample obtained at the reactor outlet. In addition to ethane (
m
/
z
= 30) and ethylene (
m
/
z
= 28), methyl radicals (
m
/
z
= 15) were also detected. The presence of methyl radicals as an intermediate suggests that the ATNLs activate the first C–H bond of methane to form methyl radicals and two methyl radicals in the gas-phase couple to form an ethane molecule that is further dehydrogenated to ethylene. A similar reaction mechanism was also observed in previous NOCM catalysts
21
.
In the absence of external and internal mass transfer limitation (Supplementary Fig.
12
and Supplementary Note
2
), kinetic measurements were performed for NOCM over 0.5% Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts. A reaction network including three individual reactions is proposed (Supplementary Fig.
13
), and both forward and reverse reactions of each reaction were considered (Supplementary Table
5
). The detailed kinetic analysis is shown in Supplementary Note
3
. In the investigated temperature range (700–780 °C), both methane coupling to ethane and ethylene formation from ethane dehydrogenation were first-order reactions (Supplementary Fig.
14
). The activation energies were 205 and 208 kJ mol
−1
(Supplementary Fig.
15
and Supplementary Table
6
), respectively, which is consistent with previous literature reports
37
. In particular, the 0.5% Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalyst showed a stable trend without deactivation for 72 hours (3 days) at 750 °C and 8.6 h
−1
GHSV (Fig.
2h
), which is in contrast to the 1% Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
and 2% Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts, which started to deactivate after a few hours (<6 hours) of reaction (Supplementary Fig.
16
). We further increased the partial pressure of methane to 0.1 atm to test the anti-coke performance of the ATNL catalysts. The catalytic performance, including conversion, selectivity and TOFs remained similar to that of 0.5% Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts tested under 1% methane. Long-term stability (3 days) of the ATNL catalysts was also achieved at 750 °C (Supplementary Fig.
17
). It should be noted that catalyst regeneration plays a crucial role in the NOCM reaction, as coke depositions leading to deactivation of catalysts are considered to be inevitable
38
. We therefore conducted an in-situ regeneration treatment by feeding an O
2
–H
2
O mixture at 450 °C for 10 hours after every 72 hours of continuous operation to test the regenerability of the Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts. After two cycles of regeneration, the catalyst continued to activate methane to form C
2
species with high selectivity (>98%) for an additional six days, although methane conversion decreased slightly by ~1% per regeneration (Supplementary Fig.
18
). At 800 and 850 °C, the long-term stability of Pt/Mo
2

catalysts was inferior to that of Pt/Mo
2

tested at 750 °C, showing performance deactivation at a time on stream (TOS) of 60–65 h (Supplementary Fig.

3c,d
), and that Pt atoms preferentially occupy the hcp sites of the supports, indicating that epitaxial growth of Pt on MXenes and their metal–support interfaces were retained at 750 °C, where Pt is adsorbed and stabilized by Pt–Mo bonds. We also correlated the Pt atoms viewed from the [0001] and
\([11\bar 20]\)
directions to solve the structure of the Pt monolayers supported by the MXene, which serves as an experimental observation of the model proposed in Fig.

supports at the reaction temperature, we carried out quasi in-situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (
Supplementary Methods
). The deconvolved molybdenum 3

spectra of a fresh Pt/Mo

catalyst reveal the doublets of both carbidic (Mo–C) and oxidized Mo (Mo–O) species at 228.2/231.4 eV and 231.7/234.6 eV, respectively (Fig.
3e
)
28
. High-resolution XPS spectra in the F 1
s
region also confirmed the presence of surface F species on the fresh Pt/Mo
2

catalysts (Fig.

). The fresh Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T

catalyst was then reduced at 750 °C in a reaction cell connected to the XPS spectrometer before submission to the analysis chamber under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Surface defunctionalization of Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts at the reaction temperature was confirmed by the disappearance of the Mo–O peaks in the Mo 3
d
region and the absence of the F 1
s
peak (Fig.
3e,f
). However, oxidized Mo was still present in Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts reduced at 450 °C, indicating that the surface of the MXene support was not fully reduced at the activation temperature (Supplementary Fig.
24
), which is consistent with previous studies
39
. The removal of the surface terminations from Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
results in decreased interlayer spacing of the MXene layers, which was also revealed by HAADF-STEM (Fig.
3c
). This observation is consistent with the X-ray diffraction results where the (002) and (004) peaks of Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
supports shift to higher angles after the reduction, corresponding to decreased
c
lattice parameters (Supplementary Fig.
25
). Moreover, these peaks disappeared for spent Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts after 72 hours of NOCM tests, indicating that the interlayer spacing of the Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
support lost the coherence (
c
direction) needed for Bragg diffraction after the defunctionalization, consistent with previous studies
39
. The reaction temperature (750 °C) also induced structural evolution of the Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts, as demonstrated by the removal of the surface functional groups (-O and -F) and the presence of trace amounts of α-MoC in the MXene supports (Supplementary Fig.
25
). The contraction of the interlayer distance limits the growth of the Pt ATNLs, facilitating the formation of Pt monolayers with larger size instead of the double nanolayers (Supplementary Fig.
26
). In addition, the high-temperature reduction defunctionalized the surface terminations, which have been known to anchor Pt precursors
29
, leading to the growth of Pt ATNLs, from 2.2 nm at 450 °C to 4.1 nm at 750 °C.
We further investigated the chemical environment of Pt ATNLs using in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Comparing 0.5% Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts reduced at 450 °C and 750 °C with metallic Pt foil, Pt L
III
edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) show that the edge energy increases (Supplementary Table
7
) and that the white-line intensity is higher (Fig.
3g
), suggesting that the unoccupied 5
d
states of Pt ATNLs shift to higher energy. According to recent literature, the occupied 5
d
states (valence states) of Pt ATNLs, which are responsible for metal–adsorbate bond energies and catalytic performance, correspondingly shift to lower energy compared to Pt foil
40
,
41
. The lower energy of the valence states, due to the interactions between ATNLs and the Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
MXene support, results in modified absorptive properties of the supported Pt catalysts
42
. Figure

shows the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the

catalysts plotted together with the Pt foil. The first-shell scattering peaks of Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T

are in the same distance region (phase-uncorrected distance,
R
= 1.5–3.2 Å) as the Pt–Pt scattering peaks from Pt foil, corresponding to metal–metal bonding. The scattering pattern for Pt/Mo
2
TiC

T

, however, is very different from that of the Pt foil. The peak intensity is greatly reduced at
R
= 2–3 Å (phase-uncorrected distances), suggesting strong deconstructive interference of Pt 5

Quantitative fitting of the EXAFS spectra gives the following average coordination numbers (CNs) and bond distances: 4.9 Pt–Pt bonds at 2.75 Å and 2.3 Pt–Mo bonds at 2.70 Å for Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T

catalysts reduced at 450 °C; 3.2 Pt–Pt bonds at 2.79 Å and 5.8 Pt–Mo bonds at 2.80 Å for Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts reduced at 750 °C (Supplementary Fig.
27
and Supplementary Table
8
). The results suggest that the Pt ATNLs directly bond with the Mo atoms from the MXene support, which is consistent with HAADF-STEM showing that the Pt nanolayers are in direct contact with the Mo atom layers (Fig.
1f
). For 0.5% Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts there is a decrease in the CN for platinum–platinum interactions (from 4.9 to 3.2), and an increase in the platinum–molybdenum CN (from 2.3 to 5.8), as the reduction temperature increases from 450 °C to 750 °C. The changes in CNs result from the formation of Pt monolayers that dominate Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts reduced at 750 °C, in contrast to the Pt bilayers that were the main structure observed in Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts reduced at 450 °C. Moreover, the average Pt–Pt bond distance (2.79 Å) of 0.5% Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
reduced at the reaction temperature is slightly longer than that of the catalysts reduced at the activation temperature (2.75 Å), indicating that the strong anchoring of Pt atoms at the C hollow sites alters the metal bonding among the Pt atoms. Our DFT calculations (Supplementary Figs.
28
and
29
) suggest that the first layer of Pt is strained to match the MXene lattice, leading to an expanded lattice distance compared to the second layer of Pt atoms (Supplementary Note
1
). For Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts with higher metal loadings (1% and 2%) reduced at 750 °C, the CNs of Pt–Pt bonds increased while the bond distances decreased compared with the ATNLs (Supplementary Fig.
30
), which is consistent with the results of HAADF-STEM showing the formation of raft-like Pt nanoflakes in the high Pt loading catalysts (Supplementary Figs.
10
and
11
).
We employed temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) to investigate the coke formation of spent 0.5% Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts tested at various temperatures and to compare them with Pt or bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts
35
. The TPO profile of the spent catalysts tested at 750 °C after 72 hours shows a major peak near 450 °C (Fig.
4a
). With the increase in the reaction temperature, a broad shoulder on the high-temperature side starts to evolve and develops into a distinguishable peak at 510 °C for catalysts tested at 850 °C, corresponding to at least two different types of carbon species. Moreover, our mass spectra results demonstrate that the concentrations of ethane, ethylene and methyl radicals started to decrease when the reaction temperature was higher than 800 °C, while the peaks of benzene (
m
/
z
= 78) and naphthalene (
m
/
z
= 128), as coke precursors, increased, especially at 850 °C (Supplementary Fig.
31
). This observation implies that high operating temperatures (>800 °C) led to heavier aromatics as coke precursor species, which resulted in the deactivation of the catalysts.

–C
38
polyaromatic hydrocarbons were the primary coke-representing compounds (Supplementary Fig.
32
). Coke formation of NOCM is proposed to be via the well-known hydrocarbon pool mechanism, which was originally proposed for MTO (methanol to olefins)
43
but has also been applied to methane non-oxidative conversion
44
. In general, it was hypothesized that the CH
2
* component, formed by the overdehydrogenation of CH
3
*, serves as the core species in the hydrocarbon pool (Supplementary Fig.
33
), which can be converted to heavier hydrocarbons, such as C
3
–C
6
, C
6+
and eventually coke
45
. Deep dehydrogenation of CH
3

y
* (

2
TiC
2
T
x
operated at 750 °C exhibited the lowest amount of coking compared with Pt nanoparticles supported by activated carbon and Pt–Bi bimetallic nanoparticles on ZSM-5 zeolites (Fig.
4b
)
35
,
46
, which results in the long-term stability of the catalysts at the optimal reaction temperature (750 °C). To obtain a reliable comparison in activity, we synthesized Pt/AC and Pt–Bi/ZSM-5 catalysts and tested them under the same conditions as for the NOCM reaction (Supplementary Fig.
34
). Under a methane conversion of 8% at 750 °C, these catalysts suffered from coking and showed lower selectivity to C
2
products compared to the ATNL catalysts, consistent with the observations of the TPO tests.
DFT studies
To gain more insight into the suppressed coke deposition of the ATNL catalysts for the NOCM reaction, the energy profiles of the NOCM reaction and side reactions were investigated using DFT (Fig.
4c
). The structures of reaction intermediates and transition states of these reactions are illustrated in Fig.
4d
, with the free energies of different reaction pathways on Pt nanoparticle (111) surfaces and ATNLs calculated. NOCM starts with the activation of the first C–H bond, which leads to dissociative adsorption of methane forming surface alkyl species (CH
3
*). Our DFT results suggest that the free energy changes of all C–H bond scission steps on the Pt monolayers and double nanolayers are ~1 eV more unfavourable than those on Pt nanoparticles (111), indicating weakened surface adsorption of the ATNLs due to the altered electronic structure suggested by XANES. Such a weakening leads to the preferential desorption of surface alkyl species to form methyl radicals instead of scission of the remaining C–H bonds towards deep dehydrogenation, which is believed to generate coke precursors.
On ATNLs at 750 °C, the scission of a secondary C–H, that is, from CH
3
* to CH
2
*, is endergonic, while CH
3
* desorption is exergonic. Furthermore, compared with the energy barrier associated with conversion of CH
3
* to CH
2
* (TS2), CH
3
* desorption to methyl radicals is even more preferred, with an energy difference of approximately 0.7–0.9 eV. This is primarily due to the relatively weak adsorption of CH
3
* over ATNLs. In contrast, the deep dehydrogenation step is more favoured over the (111) surface of Pt nanoparticles, by approximately 0.2–0.3 eV in free energy, indicating that the formation of a methyl radical is less favourable than further dehydrogenation. Compared to the methyl desorption step, C–H bond scissions of overdehydrogenated reaction intermediates, for example, CH
2
* and CH*, are both exergonic and much more favourable. These findings rationalize our experimental observations that Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts readily activate C–H bonds in methane to form CH
3
*, which is prone to desorption from the surface of ATNLs instead of overdehydrogenation, leading to higher selectivity for C
2
products while resisting coke formation.
Conclusions
In summary, our experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the epitaxial growth of atomically thin Pt nanolayers on the surface of Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
MXene. We found that ATNLs of Pt were anchored on the MXene through strong Pt–Mo bonding at the metal–support interfaces, which leads to atomic dispersion and altered absorptive properties of the Pt active sites that favour methane coupling over coking formation. Consequently, Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts delivered stable methane conversion (7%) to C
2
products with >98% selectivity and TOFs of 0.2–0.6 s
−1
. The regeneration of MXene-based catalysts is still in its infancy, and requires attention and systematic study to achieve the rational design of MXene-based materials for heterogeneous catalysis. Atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM images (Supplementary Fig.
35
) of regenerated catalysts show that Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
MXene supports were sintered with the loss of their original ordering of transition metals (Mo-Ti-Mo), and that Pt monolayers substituted the Mo layers to form an atomic layer sequence of Pt-Ti-Mo. This substitution results from the decay of the structural integrity of Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts after oxidative regeneration, as shown by the X-ray diffraction pattern (Supplementary Fig
25
). Although Pt nanolayers were still observed in the regenerated catalysts, their chemical environment and size changed, leading to a decreased (~1%) conversion after each regeneration step. Since commercial processes have been developed for converting C
2
(ethane/ethylene) to liquid hydrocarbon (C
8+
) (Supplementary Fig.
36
)
47
, the NOCM is the last part remaining to be solved, which merits future research attention for visible industrial methane-to-liquid technology.

In detail, commercial powders of molybdenum (Sigma Aldrich, 99%), titanium (325 mesh, 99%, Alfa Aesar), aluminium (325 mesh, 99.5%, Alfa Aesar) and graphite (7–11 μm, 99%, Alfa Aesar) were mixed with a molar ratio of Al/C/Ti/Mo of 1.1:1.9:1:2. The mixture was loaded into a graphite die coated with boron nitride. Next, the graphite die was transferred into a spark plasma sintering system (Fuji-211lx) where it was sintered at 1,450 °C for 60 minutes and subjected to a uniaxial pressure of 30 MPa. The synthesized Mo

Composition and structure characterization
A Thermo Fisher Scientific X Series 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-AES) was employed to determine the mass loading of Pt. After digesting the Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T
x
catalysts in a boiling aqua regia solution, the clear supernatant was collected for further characterizations. X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted on a Siemens D500 X-ray diffractometer with a CuKα (
λ
= 1.5406 Å) radiation source. HAADF-STEM experiments were conducted on a Titan Themis 300 probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope equipped with a Super-X EDX detector.
Fluorescence in-situ XAS measurements at the Pt L
III
edge (11.5640 keV) were conducted on the 10-BM bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, and ex-situ XAS was conducted at beamline 2–2 in the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. A fine powder of Pt/Mo
2
TiC
2
T

was pressed into a sample holder made of stainless steel with the catalyst wafer oriented at 45 degrees relative to the X-ray beam. The XAS cell had a water-cooled stage fitted with Kapton windows and ceramic heaters for controlling temperature. The Pt/Mo

T

catalyst was heated to 750 °C in 3.5% H
2
for 30 minutes, and spectra were obtained at 200 °C in 3.5% H
2
. A standard 3.3-cm Lytle detector was employed for measuring fluorescence XAS and the background fluorescence was reduced by a Zn filter. Fluorescence X-rays are angularly dispersed downstream of the logarithmically bent crystal and the Pt Lα fluorescence line was selectively collected by choosing the correct detector angle relative to the bent crystal. ATHENA was used for energy calibration, normalization and background subtraction of the XAS data
48
. The EXAFS data were fitted by ARTEMIS to determine the bond distance (
R
), energy shift (Δ
E

), coordination number and Debye–Waller factor (
σ

). The
k
range for the Fourier transform of the Pt K edge was Δ

, and the
R
range for fitting was Δ
R
= 1.5–3.2 Å. The amplitude reduction factor (
S

2
= 0.80) was determined using the standard Pt foil, and the CN, bond distances and Debye–Waller factor were adjusted from an initial structural model until a good fit was obtained.
At 77 K, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements (N
2
adsorption and desorption) were carried out using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus to obtain pore size, pore volume and surface area of catalysts. Degassing was first carried out for 8 h at 300 °C before the BET experiments. Elemental analysis of catalysts was performed in a SPECTRO instrument via the ICP-AES method. For Pt-loaded catalysts over MXenes, H
2
–O
2
titration was carried out at room temperature to measure Pt dispersion.
Kinetics measurements
The catalytic performance and kinetics measurements were tested in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. Catalysts were activated in a H
2
-N
2
flow (H
2
and N
2
were 33 and 67 standard cubic centimetres per min, respectively) at 450 °C for 4 hours. The reactor was then purged by nitrogen with a flow of 50 standard cubic centimetres per min for 15 min. Various GHSV values were achieved by varying the weight of catalysts and feed flow rates. The standard operating conditions were 750 °C, 0.01 atm methane partial pressure and 50 mg of catalyst. The absence of internal and external diffusion effects was confirmed using the Weisz and Prater criterion
49
, while heat transfer effect was also excluded using the Mears criterion
50
.
An Agilent GC6890 with both a flame ionization detector and thermal conductivity detector, and a Carboxen 1010 PLOT capillary column (30 m × 0.53 mm) were used for quantitative analysis of products. In typical cases, following an initial transient period, the catalyst exhibited stable performance for several hours. All datasets were taken at 10 min TOS during the stable period unless stated otherwise. A blank experiment using the unsupported MXene was tested under standard operating conditions, with the methane conversion <0.01%. All experiments have carbon mass balances of 98.8 ± 0.9%. For the reaction experiments, good repeatability, generally within less than 1.5% deviation, was achieved for all quantitative analyses. For TPSR experiments, the catalyst was reduced using 5 vol% H
2
at 400 °C for 2 hours before the TPSR measurement. On cooling to room temperature, a 5% CH
4
in N
2
gas mixture flow was fed at 20 ml min
−1
, and the temperature was increased from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min
−1
. A thermal conductivity detector was used to detect products. In the TPO process, 5% O
2
in N
2
gas was used as the oxidizing gas. The spent catalysts were used for TPO tests. For catalyst regeneration, a 5% steam and 5% O
2
mixture was prepared and fed into the reactor where the spent catalyst was packed. Then, the reactor was heated to 450 °C and maintained constant for 10 hours. When regeneration was accomplished, the gas was switched to N
2
for purging for 15 min, followed by feeding 20% H
2
at 450 °C for catalyst activation before use. For initial catalytic performance tests (less than 1-h TOS), the mass balance was calculated by (∑(carbon mass of detectable products)/carbon mass of methane × 100%.
DFT computational methods
DFT calculations were performed on the MXene–Pt system using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)
51
, employing the projector augmented wave method for ionic cores and the PW91 form of exchange-correlation functional in the generalized-gradient approximation. The plane-wave cut-off energy levels for bulk and slab calculations were set as 520 and 400 eV, respectively
52
, while a first-order Methfessel–Paxton smearing with a width of 0.15 eV was evaluated by extrapolating to zero broadening. The energy convergence criteria for all self-consistent field calculations were set as 10
−5
eV, and all structural relaxations were performed until forces were less than 0.02 eV Å
−1
. For structural optimization of a single unit cell of the MXene monolayer, a 12 × 12 × 1 gamma-centred k-point mesh was used. For larger unit cells consisting of 8 × 8 unit cells of the MXene monolayer and Pt film or nanoparticles, we used a 2×2×1 k-point mesh in our calculations. A vacuum separation of more than 20 Å was kept on top of the MXene layer to prevent interaction with its periodic image. Monkhorst–Pack meshes of 7 × 7 × 1 k-points were employed for sampling the surface Brillouin zone for p(2×2) unit cells of Pt(111) and Mo

*) and methane dehydrogenation that forms CH
3
*. A p(4×4) Pt (111) unit cell, that is, two p(2×4) Pt (111) unit cells, was used for methane coupling. All transition states were confirmed to have only one imaginary vibrational mode. All free energies were zero-point energy-corrected, and the change in entropies for adsorption processes was calculated using the operating reaction temperature and the relationship proposed by Campbell
53
. Specifically, the standard entropy of adsorbed species at a given temperature is linearly correlated with the standard entropy of the gas-phase molecules and the ideal gas constant:
$$S_{\mathrm{ad}}^0\left( T \right) = 0.7S_{\mathrm{gas}}^0\left( T \right) - 3.3R$$
