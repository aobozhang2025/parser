Abstract
Low-temperature methanation allows the near-equilibrium conversion of CO
2
to methane at atmospheric pressure, promising remarkable energy efficiency and economic interests. However, it remains challenging for the efficient catalytic activation of CO
2
at low temperature owing to the kinetic limitations of hydrogenation intermediates. Here we report that Ni-based inverse catalysts composed of oxide nano-islands loaded on metallic Ni support show significant activity advantages over traditional Ni/oxide with the same composition. The optimized CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst realizes ~90% CO
2
conversion and >99% CH
4
selectivity at 200 °C and atmospheric pressure; it also exhibits excellent long-term stability and overheating/start–stop cyclic operation stability. Mechanistic studies show that the inverse interface effectively modulates H
2
and CO
2
coverage and alters the configuration of adsorbed oxygenates, which benefits the hydrogenation of surface intermediates. Energy and economic analyses demonstrate that the low-temperature CO
2
methanation process powered by inverse catalysts potentially reduces both capital investment and methane production costs.

Main
The catalytic conversion of captured CO
2
and renewable hydrogen into methane is an attractive solution that combines the potential of reducing CO
2
emissions with hydrogen energy storage
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
. Moreover, methane can be transported and distributed via the existing natural gas network
5
, which saves potential added infrastructure expenditures. Although CO
2
methanation is thermodynamically favorable, the use of efficient catalysts is necessary to overcome the sluggish reaction kinetics and reach a suitable industrial application threshold
6
,
7
.
Traditionally, noble metal-based catalysts (for example, Ru, Rh, Pd and Ir) are used in low-temperature CO
2
methanation because of their high activity
8
, low activation temperature and operational temperature (~250 °C), and high stability over a broad temperature range
9
. Recently, it has been reported that C-doped RuO
2
enables CO
2
methanation at 180 °C and 2 MPa, with a competitive high time–space yield of CH
4
of 110 mmol CH
4
g

h
−1
(ref.
4
), among the most active low-temperature CO
2
methanation catalysts. In contrast, nickel is also considered as an efficient and relatively inexpensive metal center for CO
2
methanation
10
. However, Ni-based catalysts generally require temperatures above 350 °C to achieve sufficient reaction rates owing to their relatively low reducibility that leads to sintering and deactivation (Supplementary Table
1
). Therefore, the development of cost-effective CO
2
methanation catalysts able to operate efficiently below 200 °C remains a challenge in heterogeneous catalysis.
Generally, the performance of methanation catalysts is influenced greatly by the support material (redox or basicity of oxides), metal (size-dependent effects) and metal–support interface (charge transfer effects and interfacial sites)
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
17
. The design of Ni-based catalysts has primarily focused on tailoring the interfacial structure between nanometer-sized Ni particles (the weight percentage is usually 5–30%) and oxide substrates
18
,
19
. So far, many strategies have been developed to improve the activity of such catalysts, such as changing the Ni loading, including doping additives, regulating the structure and improving strong metal–support interactions
20
,
21
,
22
. It has been reported that enhancing Ni loading to 40–50% could achieve ~80% CO
2
conversion at a low temperature range of 230–250 °C (ref.
23
). However, the optimal reaction temperatures for CO
2
methanation are still higher than 200 °C on these reported catalysts. The relatively poor low-temperature activity of conventional Ni-oxide interfacial active sites can be attributed to the high hydrogenation barrier of key oxygenate intermediates
24
. To facilitate the conversion of surface intermediates, tailoring the interfacial structure is crucial. In previous studies, ‘inverse catalysts’ composed of a nano-oxide dispersed on a metal support were reported to favor the asymmetric adsorption mode of CO
2
and oxygenates that prevents the formation of overstabilized species and thereby benefits CO
2
hydrogenation to methanol
25
,
26
. Further, it has been shown that the inverse oxide–metal interface exhibits high activity in reducing oxygenate intermediates such as formate and methoxy intermediates during CO
2
hydrogenation
25
,
27
,
28
. Utilizing these properties of the inverse catalyst interface, it is possible to construct a more active site for low-temperature CO
2
methanation by immobilizing nano-oxide over a metallic Ni support.
Herein, we demonstrate that Ni-based inverse catalysts exhibit improved low-temperature activity for CO
2
methanation compared with traditional Ni/oxide catalysts with the same composition. Among the tested nano-oxides, the CeZrO
x
on metallic Ni surface inverse catalyst achieves ~40% CO
2
conversion at 180 °C and ~90% at 200 °C, with >99% CH
4
selectivity, under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 15,000 mL g
cat
−1
h
−1
at atmospheric pressure. Meanwhile, the inverse catalyst also shows long-term stability and resistance to overheating and start–stop operating conditions. Kinetic studies suggest that the oxide–metal inverse interface enhances hydrogen adsorption and weakens binding of carbon dioxide on the active site, thereby optimizing the surface coverage of reactants and intermediates. Furthermore, in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic studies reveal that the inverse interfacial structure assists the formation of asymmetric adsorption of CO
2
and oxygenate intermediates, which accelerates the reduction of surface species. CO
2
is hydrogenated to CH
4
via both the formate pathway and the CO pathway on the CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst, which probably accounts for the high low-temperature activity. Process simulations and economic analysis of an integrated CO
2
methanation plant demonstrate that low-temperature operation powered by the inverse CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst fully utilizes the advantage of high CO
2
equilibrium conversion and notably reduces CO
2
desorption and cycling energy consumption, which may generate considerable economical interest in both lower capital investment and CH
4
production cost.
Results
Catalytic performance of the inverse catalysts
A series of oxide-supported Ni (~0–50 mol% Ni) and Ni-supported nano-oxide (~0–50 mol% oxide) catalysts were synthesized via the pH-adjusting oxalate stepwise co-precipitation method (
Methods
)
22
,
28
. A schematic diagram of the synthetic procedure for the inverse catalysts is shown as Fig.
1a
(inset 1). The oxides were sequentially deposited on the prepared nickel oxalate precipitate support. After calcination and reduction, oxide/Ni inverse catalysts with oxide islands immobilized on Ni support were obtained. A relatively large-scale synthesis could be achieved through this method (Supplementary Fig.
1
); 500 g of catalyst was prepared in a single batch. In addition, conventional oxide-supported Ni catalysts with the same interfacial elements were also prepared by the sequential precipitation method (Fig.
1a
, inset 2). The as-prepared inverse samples are denoted as
y
mol% MO
x
/Ni (where
y
is the molar percentage of loaded MO
x
component in the sample, M = Zr, Ce, Mg, Si and Ce–Zr, with
y
typically less than 20 mol%). The catalytic performance for CO
2
methanation was evaluated with a CO
2
:H
2
:N
2
ratio of 18:72:10 at a temperature range of 180–240 °C under ambient pressure (Supplementary Fig.
2
). The catalyst particle was gradually reduced to 60 mesh (catalyst particle diameter = 0.25 mm) until the catalytic activity remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig.
3
), suggesting that internal mass transport is no longer a concern. In addition, the catalysts were diluted serially to 25 times by inert SiC until no obvious local temperature increases were observed, and the temperature rise of the catalyst bed was controlled within 6 °C. Before the reaction, pristine catalysts were pretreated by 20% H
2
at 450 °C for 3 h.

First, the CO

methanation activity of diluted Ni–ZrO
2
catalysts was systematically evaluated over a wide range of Ni loading (molar percentage) at 200 °C and a WHSV of 15,000 mL g
cat
−1
h
−1
(Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.

). With increasing molar percentage of Ni from 0 mol% to 100 mol%, a structural reversal of the metallic species (or oxides) from small nanoparticles to a continuous phase occurs (Supplementary Figs.
5
and
6
and Supplementary Table
2
). Interestingly, the space–time yield (STY) of CH
4
in the kinetic region for Ni–ZrO
2
samples at 200 °C shows a double volcano-shaped dependence on the molar ratio of oxide in the catalyst. The two local maxima appear at 13 mol% ZrO
2
/Ni (87 mol% Ni/ZrO
2
) and 30 mol% Ni/ZrO

, respectively. The CH

for the 30 mol% Ni/ZrO

conventional catalyst. Unlike in the widely reported conventional oxide-supported Ni catalysts (with a molar percentage of Ni ranging from approximately 10% to 40%), a second maximum is rarely observed; this is attributed to the formation of the inverse interfacial structure
29
,
30
.
The catalytic CO
2
methanation performance was compared further for a series of inverse catalysts and conventional Ni/oxide catalysts of the same compositions. The 13 mol% ZrO
2
/Ni inverse catalyst realized 88.2% CO
2
conversion with >99.9% methane selectivity at 240 °C (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
7a
). In contrast, the CO
2
conversion was only 19.8% for a conventional 30 mol% Ni/ZrO
2
catalyst. Apart from ZrO
2
/Ni catalysts, the advantages of inverse configuration were also observed for other reducible and nonreducible oxides constructed as inverse catalysts, such as CeO
2
/Ni, MgO/Ni and SiO
2
/Ni (Fig.
1c–e
, Supplementary Figs.
7b–d
and
8
and Supplementary Table
3
). The enhanced CO
2
adsorption capacities of these inverse catalysts compared with conventional catalysts is one possible reason for the observed performance improvements (Supplementary Fig.
9
).
As CeO
2
and ZrO
2
particles present relatively good CO
2
methanation activity, the mixed oxide strategy is used further to engineer the interfacial structure. CO
2
-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) studies revealed that the formation of mixed oxide on Ni support further enhanced the CO
2
activation capacity (Supplementary Fig.
9
). Compared with other state-of-the-art Ni-based CO
2
methanation catalysts
31
,
32
,
33
,
34
, the diluted 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst exhibited high low-temperature CO
2
methanation activity, which increased strongly at 160 °C and achieved ~40% CO
2
conversion and >99% CH
4
selectivity at 180 °C under a WHSV of 15,000 mL g
cat
−1
h
−1
at atmospheric pressure (Fig.
2a
and Supplementary Fig.
10a
); the CO
2
conversion was ~90% at 200 °C. In comparison, a widely recognized low-temperature CO
2
methanation catalyst, 10 mol% Ru/TiO
2
(refs.
31
,
32
,
33
,
34
), required temperatures of ~280 °C to obtain 44% CO
2
conversion under similar conditions. In addition, the 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO
x
catalyst was almost inactive below 240 °C, which further highlights the importance of the inverse configuration for low-temperature CO
2
methanation. As the metallic Ni NPs showed poor activity in the CO
2
hydrogenation reaction, it is clear that the combination of a continuous phase of metallic Ni, with dispersed nano-oxides, are a key factor that controls the activity of the inverse catalysts.

The reaction gas was further diluted to rule out local hot spots more thoroughly (<1 °C); performance evaluations demonstrated that the CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst started to show observable CH
4
formation at 160 °C, even in a dilute stream of 0.4% CO
2
(4 mbar), a typical atmospheric CO
2
concentration (Supplementary Fig.
10b
). In addition, the CO
2
conversion increased to 93% when the pressure was increased to 20 bar at 180 °C (Fig.
2b
). This finding is comparable with that of the RuO
2
/C catalyst
4
, which was reported recently as the most competitive low temperature methanation catalyst at 180 °C (work at 20 bar, 110 mmol CH

under the same reaction conditions (Supplementary Fig.

). The conversion-STY
CH4
profiles of literature-reported Ni- and Ru-based catalysts at 200 °C are summarized (Supplementary Table
4
); the mass specific activity of 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst is competitive. The intrinsic catalytic activities with inert dilution were also used to calculate the CH
4
-based apparent activation energy (
E
a-CH4
) (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Fig.
11
); that of 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni is 66.5 kJ mol
−1
, which is lower than that of 13 mol% ZrO
2
/Ni (74.4 kJ mol
−1
) and much lower than that of conventional 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO
x
(96.2 kJ mol
−1
) and 30 mol% Ni/ZrO
2
catalysts (94.4 kJ mol
−1
), indicating the promise of the Ni-supported nano-oxide inverse configuration for CO
2
methanation.
Usually, supported Ni catalysts are prone to deactivate under harsh reaction conditions such as overheating and start–stop cycles in CO
2
methanation owing to the strong tendency of sintering, leaching via Ni(CO)
4
and coke deposition
35
,
36
. The undiluted 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst was used to investigate stability in the intensely exothermic reaction. The 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst exhibited high CO
2
hydrogenation stability in a long-term stability test, including 350 h of temperature cycling and start–stop cycling tests (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Table
5
) and 400 h of uninterrupted testing (Supplementary Fig.
12a
), which offers a potential solution for coupling in unsteady renewable hydrogen systems. Even if the catalyst experienced a 450 °C thermal shock, the initial activity can be restored when the operating temperature drops back to 180 °C. It is worth noting that the heat released by methanation reaction promotes the reaction, and in the long-term stability test at 180 °C, the bed temperature remained stable at 199.3 °C (Supplementary Fig.
12b
). Moreover, when introducing additional 40–50 vol% steam in the gas feed at varied temperatures (180–450 °C), the activity and selectivity recovered after removing the steam (Supplementary Fig.
13
). Typically, 5–10 vol% water is introduced to test water resistance of catalysts
37
,
38
; the test result under 40–50 vol% water demonstrated that the 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst also realized high water resistance. In summary, the MO
x
/Ni inverse configuration was demonstrated to be a highly active and selective interfacial structure for the low-temperature CO
2
methanation reaction. CeZrO
x
/Ni is the most active combination among the studied inverse catalysts. Its high activity, long-term stability and high tolerance to unsteady operation and other harsh conditions showcase its potential for further applications.
Structural characterization of the inverse catalysts
To uncover the structural properties of the CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst that determines the high catalytic performance in CO
2
hydrogenation, the structural properties of the inverse catalyst were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that the NiO support in the prereduced 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst is polycrystalline with a uniform particle size of ~5.4 nm (Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Fig.
14a
). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry element mapping of reduced catalyst demonstrated that the Ce and Zr components are highly dispersed on the Ni substrate (Fig.
3b
). Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images showed further that the inclusion of CeZrO
x
mixed nano-oxide (
d
= 3.07 Å) on the 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni-reduced sample, suggesting the formation of oxide–metal inverse configuration (Fig.
3c
). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the reduced 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst exhibited typical diffraction peaks at 44.4°, 51.7° and 76.1°, corresponding to face-centered cube-structured Ni nanoparticles (12 nm determined by the Scherrer equation) after reduction (Fig.
3d
). As shown in Supplementary Fig.
15
, the average particle size of Ni on the reduced 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO
x
catalyst was about 12.3 nm. Elemental mapping confirmed that the 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO
x
catalyst is in an oxide-supported Ni configuration. Quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig.
3e
and Supplementary Table
6
) studies demonstrated that the CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst was fully reduced after 450 °C reduction. It is worth noting that the intensity of Ce
4+
species at 916.8 eV of CeZrO
x
/Ni-reduced was weaker than that of the pristine catalyst, suggesting that the majority of Ce species were reduced to Ce
3+
(84.5%)
39
, which increases the percentage of oxygen vacancies in the reduced catalyst. A reduction-induced positive shift of Zr 3
d
binding energy was also observed, which indicates the formation of Ce–O–Zr species
40
,
41
. The XRD and TEM characterizations of the spent 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst after 400 h reaction demonstrate that the morphology and electronic properties of inverse catalyst remained intact after the long-time high temperature and water vapor treatments (Supplementary Figs.
14b
and
16
); inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements of the spent 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni catalyst verified that there was almost no Ni loss during the reaction process (Supplementary Table
3
).

Furthermore, the Ni dispersion was 7.8% determined by H
2

), which agrees well with the XRD results. Compared with the Ni/CeZrO
x
, the first H
2
desorption peak of the 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst shifted to 180 °C, about 20 °C higher than the 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO
x
conventional catalyst (Fig.
3f
), indicating that the chemisorption of H
2
is intensified on the Ni support compared with that of the supported Ni NPs. Kinetic studies (Supplementary Tables
7
and
8
) showed that the apparent H
2
and CO
2
reaction orders of the 13 mol% CeZrO
x
/Ni sample are 0.6 and 0.38, while the reaction orders of 30 mol% Ni/CeZrO
x
catalyst are 0.95 and 0.095 (Fig.
3g,h
). According to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, the change of the apparent order of reactants suggests a decrease in CO
2
surface coverage and an increase in hydrogen surface coverage on the inverse catalyst
42
, indicating that the inverse interface configuration modulates the adsorption intensity of both reactants.

For the Ni(111)/Zr
4
O
8
conventional model, the adsorption configurations of CO
2
and HCOO* intermediate involve two oxygen atoms bonded to Zr atoms at the interface, while the carbon atom interacts with Ni atoms (Fig.
4a
). In the Zr
4
O
8
/Ni(111) slab model, the two oxygen atoms of CO
2
and HCOO* intermediate bond with Zr and Ni atoms, respectively (Fig.
4a
), which is in an asymmetric adsorption mode. For the Ni(111)/Zr
4
O
8
conventional model, the CO
2
hydrogenation to CH
4
is an exothermic process because the adsorption of oxygen species is strong on the oxide surface; the energy of surface reconstruction is also included. In this process, the highest activation barrier is 1.11 eV for HCOO* + H* → H
2
COO* (Fig.
4a
). The elementary step of H
2
COO + H → H
2
COOH is an endothermic process with an energy input of 0.67 eV, while the activation barrier is just 0.70 eV, leading to almost no activation barrier for the backward process. Therefore, it is difficult for CO
2
methanation on Ni(111)/Zr
4
O
8
to proceed through the formate pathway at low temperature. For the CO pathway, the reaction barrier of CO
2
* + H* → COOH* is 2.07 eV, which is difficult to overcome at a 180 °C reaction temperature (Supplementary Fig.
22
). In addition, CO
2
could also be directly dissociated into linear adsorbed CO* on Ni(111)/Zr
4
O
8
with a dissociation energy barrier of 0.50 eV (Supplementary Fig.
22
), but the hydrogenation of CO* to HCO* is difficult owing to the close activation barrier and endothermic nature (Supplementary Table

For the CO pathway on the Zr
4
O
8
/Ni(111) inverse slab model, however, the hydrogenation of CO* to HCO* is easier than that on the conventional model; the energy barrier is 1.05 eV with an endothermic energy of 0.92 eV (Supplementary Table
10
). For the formate pathway, the H
2
COO* + H* → H
2
COOH* step possesses the highest activation barrier of 1.10 eV (Fig.
4a
). The addition of Ce could reduce the activation barrier through the formate pathway (Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Table
11
), especially the step of H
2
COO + H → H
2
COOH (1.10 versus 0.50 eV). Moreover, CO
2
could proceed through H-assisted dissociation into carboxylate species (COOH*), which could be hydrogenated to CH
4
through a bridge-adsorbed CO* (Supplementary Table
10
, E
a-max
= 1.12 eV). In addition, the activation barriers for the dissociation of CO* to C* and O* are 1.93 and 2.15 eV on Zr
4
O
8
/Ni(111) and Ce
2
Zr
2
O

/Ni(111), which suggests that the mechanism of CO dissociation into C and O ad-atoms is unlikely to occur (Fig.

and Supplementary Fig.
23
).
To further clarify the influence of MO
x
–Ni structure on the mode of surface adsorbates or intermediates, in situ DRIFTS studies were carried out under the typical CO
2
hydrogenation atmosphere (Fig.
4c
)
25
. The surface species under a reactive atmosphere (CO
2
+ 4H
2
) are bridged CO* adsorption (1,833 and 1,930 cm
−1
) and linear CO* adsorption (2,060–2,070 cm
−1
) on Ni sites, bicarbonates (1,663 and 1,235 cm
−1
), formate (1,611, 1,563–1,570 and 1,380 cm
−1
) and carbonates (1,314 and 1,430 cm
−1
)
43
,
44
, which were confirmed by the H–D,
12
C–
13
C isotope effect (Supplementary Figs.
24
and
25
). It is observed that the CO* is mainly linear adsorbed on the conventional Ni/MO
x
interface, and occupies the active sites of catalyst, which is consistent with the calculation results. On the contrary, the CO* on the inverse MO
x
/Ni interface is mainly bridged adsorption together with little linear CO* from direct dissociation of CO
2
on the metal
45
,
46
, which could prevent the formation of Ni(CO)
4
and the loss of Ni. In addition, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
26
, when the CO
2
in the feed is cut off, the quick consumption of CO and formate species and the formation of CH
4
on the inverse MO
x
/Ni catalyst are observed by in situ DRIFTS. Because of the dead volume in the reaction system, the formation of CH
4
from surface oxygenates is much smaller than decay of existing CH
4
making it difficult to observe the formation of methane from surface intermediate through mass spectra (Supplementary Fig.
26
). The formation of CH
4
is confirmed by hydrogenation of preabsorbed oxygenate intermediates (Supplementary Fig.
27
). These results demonstrate that CO
2
could be hydrogenated to CH
4
on inverse MO
x
/Ni catalysts by two pathways, as shown in Fig.
4d
: the formate pathway and CO pathway. The CO* is hydrogenated from carboxylate species (the activation barrier of CO
2
direct dissociation to CO* is much higher, 1.20 versus 0.78 eV, as shown in Supplementary Table
10
), whereas carboxylate intermediate species are difficult to form on the conventional Ni/MO
x
interface, meaning that CH
4
could only be obtained through the formate intermediate species and directly dissociated linear CO*. The hydrogenation of formate species and linear CO* involves strongly endothermic processes, and the reverse reactions proceed more easily; therefore, hydrogenation of CO
2
to CH
4
is difficult at low temperatures on the conventional Ni/MO
x
catalysts.
Economic analysis of the low-temperature methanation process
The high low-temperature activity of the CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalysts can power a CO
2
capture and utilization facility, potentially enhancing the energy and economic prospects of the entire process. The energy and process economy of an integrated CO
2
methanation plant (annual CH
4
production is set as 26 kt yr
−1
; Supplementary Table
12
) composed of a reaction module, compression module, steam recovery module and CO
2
absorption module were simulated using the Aspen Plus (V10)
47
, Aspen Energy Analyzer (AEA) and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (APEA) packages of Aspen
48
. Using the same process (atmospheric CO
2
methanation) but different catalysts and corresponding unit operation parameters, the energy and economic prospects of the process using the CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst and Ni/CeZrO
x
conventional catalyst were evaluated (Fig.
5a
and Supplementary Fig.
28
). Considering the hot spots caused by exothermic heat in the reaction, the bed temperatures of CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst (set at 180 °C, low-temperature process (LT process)) and Ni/CeZrO
x
catalyst (set at 300 °C, high-temperature process (HT process)) were used for economic analysis, that is, 200 °C and 315 °C, respectively (Supplementary Table
13
). It is found that the higher operation temperature led to a lower single-pass CO
2
conversion and thereby notably increased the energy consumption of the CO
2
desorption and recycling process (200–315 °C; Fig.
5b
). The analysis also revealed that the grade increment of the reaction heat at high working conditions was unable to compensate the consumption of CO
2
cycling, which demonstrated that the lower working temperature is more energy efficient as long as a sufficient reaction rate can be realized near equilibrium conversion. In the HT process (74.5% single-pass conversion compared with 89.9% for the LT process was used for simulation, which uses the conventional Ni/CeZrO
x
and inverse CeZrO
x
/Ni as catalysts; Supplementary Table
13
), the CO
2
desorption and recycling processes consumed all the available cold utility. In comparison, an additional 8.4 MW of heat can be used for additional steam production in the inverse-catalyst-powered LT process (Fig.
5c
). Due to the high activity of the CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst, the catalyst filling quantity of the LT process was reduced by 45.6%. The CO
2
reflux flow rate and CO
2
desorption heat consumption of the LT process dropped by 69.5% and 76.4% of the HT process, respectively (Fig.
5d
). The advantages enabled by the inverse catalyst allowed notable cost savings in the fixed investment (2.3 million dollars, 23% compared with the HT process; Fig.
5e
and Supplementary Table
14
) and decreased the production cost of methane by $18.0 per ton of methane (11.5% reduction on the nonmaterial spend; Supplementary Table
15
).
Discussion
The construction of the MO
x
/Ni inverse structure appears to be a feasible strategy to enhance the low-temperature activity of Ni-based catalysts for CO
2
methanation. The most active CeZrO
x
/Ni inverse catalyst realized 40% CO
2
conversion at atmospheric pressure at 180 °C; 93% CO
2
conversion can be achieved when elevating the pressure to 20 bar. In situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations reveal that the high performance of the inverse catalyst is corroborated by suitable reactant coverage, reactive asymmetric adsorbed oxygenate intermediates and low barrier of hydrogenation of formate intermediate species. In addition, CO
2
can also be hydrogenated to methane on inverse MO
x
/Ni catalysts through the CO pathway, which prevents poisoning of catalytic active sites by CO. The high methanation activity in the low-temperature region fully utilizes the advantage of high CO
2
equilibrium conversion and significantly reduces the CO
2
desorption and cycling energy consumption, potentially realizing considerable economic interests in both capital investment and methane production costs in a practical CO
2
methanation process.

). The dried powder was calcined in a furnace at 400 °C for 3 h (ref.

). The loadings of Ce, Zr and Ni were determined by ICP optical emission spectrometry (OES).
Catalytic performance evaluation
The performance evaluation for CO
2
methanation was carried out in a fixed-bed flow stainless-steel reactor at atmospheric pressure (purchased from Quzhou Vode Instrument). Generally, 100 mg of catalyst (60 mesh) was diluted in SiC (weight ratio of catalyst/SiC, 1:25) and then packed into the stainless-steel tube (inner diameter 10 mm, height of catalyst bed 28 mm). Before a catalytic reaction, the catalyst was reduced in a stream of 20% H
2
/N
2
at 450 °C for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reductive gas was replaced by the reaction gas (CO
2
:H
2
:N

= 18:72:10). The total gas flow rate was controlled at a range of 25–200 mL min
−1
for varied WHSV tests. The performance evaluations were taken at 140–240 °C, and each temperature test point was held for 3 h. The temperature rise of the catalyst bed was controlled within 6 °C during temperature-programmed tests.
The outlet gas of the reactor was analyzed by an online gas chromatographer (GC-8860, Agilent) that was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector. The CO
2
conversion and CH
4

are defined in the following equation

$${{\mathrm{Conv}}}.\left({{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}\right) \% =\frac{F({{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2})\times {C}_{{{\mathrm{in}}}}\left({{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}\right)-F{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}\times \frac{{A}_{{{\mathrm{N}}}_{2}-{{\mathrm{in}}}}}{{A}_{{{\mathrm{N}}}_{2}-{{\mathrm{out}}}}}{\,\times\, C}_{{{\mathrm{out}}}}\left({{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}\right)}{F({{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2})\times {C}_{{{\mathrm{in}}}}\left({{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}\right)}$$

Stability evaluations
Stability evaluations include temperature cycling tests, steady-state tests and steam inlet tests. Two-hundred milligrams of catalyst (60 mesh, height of catalyst bed 10 mm) was packed into the quartz tube reactor (inner diameter 6 mm) to test the long-term stability and explore the influences of thermal and steam during the reaction.

. Then, the container was sealed in a microwave digestion furnace and heated for dissociation. The cooled solution was transferred to a plastic volumetric bottle with deionized water. The dissolved solutions were tested successively, and the diluted solutions beyond the curve should be tested again

27
.
XPS
The quasi in situ XPS and ex situ XPS characterizations were performed on a ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250Xi equipped with an in situ reactor, using Al Kα radiation as excitation source (
hv

−10
mbar analysis chamber vacuum level, 12.5 kV working voltage and 16 mA filament current. The passing energy was 30 eV with a step of 0.1 eV, and the signal accumulation was approximately ten cycles. Before quasi in situ XPS testing, the catalyst sample was placed inside the reactor chamber and pretreated by 20% H
2
at 450 °C for 3 h. The sample was transferred to the measurement chamber without ingress of air after cooling to room temperature. The measurement chamber was evacuated to a vacuum level below 8 × 10
−10

s

In situ DRIFTS
DRIFTS was performed on a Bruker Vertex 70V, which was equipped a Harrick cell and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector. Before testing, the catalysts were pretreated by 20% H

−1
, and the acquisition time of each spectrum was about 1 min. The background was collected first at pure Ar and test temperature before each experiment. The test temperature was chosen to be 140 °C, to better observe the intermediate species at a lower activity. The transmittance was obtained by dividing the collected sample reflectance spectrum by the background spectrum, then the spectrum was converted to Kubelka–Monk. Then, the gas flow was changed to H

DFT calculations
All spin-polarized calculations were carried out with Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package
50

51
. The electron exchange and correlation energy was treated within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
52
functional of generalized gradient approximations
52
. The Hubbard
U
model of
U
eff
4.0 eV and 5.0 eV was used to describe the interaction of Zr 4
d
and Ce 4
f
electrons, respectively. The election–ion interaction was described by the projector augmented wave method
53
. The iterative solutions of Kohn–Sham equations were done using a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The sampling of the Brillouin zone was performed using a Monkhorst–Pack scheme with Gamma
k
-points
54
. The electronic relaxation criterion is that the change in total energy between two successive steps should be less than 1.0 × 10
−4
eV and the forces less than 0.05 eV Å
−1
. For ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), simulations were for 100 ps at a time step of 1 fs. The canonical ensemble (NVT) and Nosé–Hoover thermostats were set to 550 K (refs.
55
,
56
). For the forward model, a Ni
19
cluster was loaded on a ZrO
2
(101) surface; there are 108 Zr, 162 O and 19 Ni atoms, where the bottom 27 Zr and 54 O atoms were fixed in calculations and the others were allowed to relax. After AIMD simulation, the Ni

cluster expanded to a two-dimensional shape. For the inverse model, a Zr

O
8
cluster truncated from monoclinic ZrO
2
crystal (
P

) was placed on a four-layer Ni(111) facet with (6 × 6) supercell, so there are 144 Ni, 4 Zr and 8 O atoms in the Zr

Energy and economy analysis of CO

methanation process
The energy and process economy were simulated using the Aspen Plus (V10), AEA and APEA packages of Aspen
48
,
53
. The ELECNRTL physical property method was selected for this polar electrolyte system. AEA was used to combine the hot and cold flow streams in the two processes; the pinch analysis method was adopted. Equipment cost is the main fixed capital cost (FCC), which is calculated by the economic analysis module of APEA. Other capital costs are calculated by multiplying the corresponding coefficient based on the equipment cost. The calculation formula of FCC is as follows:
$${\rm{FCC}}={\rm{EC}}(1+\sum _{{{i}}}{\mathrm{RC}}_i),$$
where EC is the equipment cost; RC
i
is the ratio of the
i
th component to the equipment cost, and
i
is the components of fixed cost.
The production cost mainly consists of the raw material cost, utility cost and labor cost. The CO
2
and H
2
feed amount are 7.04 × 10
4
t yr
−1
and 1.29 × 10
4
t yr
−1
. The price of feed CO
2
and H
2
is set as −55 USD t
−1
and 2,870 USD t
−1
(ref.
54
). The utility cost and operation labor cost are calculated by APEA. Assuming the depreciation life (DL) of the equipment is 15 years and the residual value (RV) is 4%, the annual interest rate (IR) is set at 10%. The straight-line method is adopted to calculate the depreciation cost. The calculation formula of production cost is as follows:
$$\begin{array}{l}{\rm{Production}}\,{\rm{cost}}={\mathrm{RC}}+{\mathrm{UC}}+{\mathrm{OMC}}+{\mathrm{DC}}+{\mathrm{POC}}+{\mathrm{AC}}+{\mathrm{DSC}}\\\qquad\qquad\quad\;{\mathrm{DC}}={\mathrm{FCC}}\times {(1+{\mathrm{IR}})}^{{\mathrm{DL}}}(1-{\mathrm{RV}})^{{\mathrm{DL}}}\end{array},$$
where RC is the cost of raw materials; UC is the cost of utilities; OMC is the cost of operating and maintenance; DC is the cost of depreciation; POC is the cost of plant overhead cost; AC is the cost of administrative; and DSC is the cost of distribution and selling.
